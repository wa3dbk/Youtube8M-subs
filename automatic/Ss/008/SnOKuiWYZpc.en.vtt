power<00:00:05.370> stations<00:00:05.940> Midway<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.629> marva<00:00:07.049> game

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
power stations Midway was marva game

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.410 
power stations Midway was marva game
where<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.649> was<00:00:07.830> kind<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:08.940> like<00:00:09.120> too

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
where it was kind of just like too

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.020 
where it was kind of just like too
complicated<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.800> an<00:00:10.950> average<00:00:11.460> casual

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
complicated for just an average casual

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.180 
complicated for just an average casual
player<00:00:12.389> there<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:12.840> just<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.080> lot<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.889> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
player there was just a lot going on and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.120 
player there was just a lot going on and
it<00:00:14.639> was<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> lot<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.269> take<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.800> just

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
it was a lot to take in so I just

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.010 
it was a lot to take in so I just
promised<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:17.880> more<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.420> simplistic

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
promised a lot more of a simplistic

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.130 
promised a lot more of a simplistic
approach<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.420> yeah<00:00:21.420> they<00:00:21.720> did<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:21.960> with

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
approach to it and yeah they did it with

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.060 
approach to it and yeah they did it with
battlestations<00:00:22.680> pacific<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> controls

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
battlestations pacific so the controls

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.179 
battlestations pacific so the controls
still<00:00:29.609> stay<00:00:30.060> largely<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.900> same<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> mean<00:00:31.769> it's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
still stay largely the same I mean it's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.819 
still stay largely the same I mean it's
quite<00:00:32.460> complicated<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.420> into<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.500> with

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
quite complicated to get into but with

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.100 
quite complicated to get into but with
the<00:00:35.070> addition<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.880> two<00:00:35.940> campaigns<00:00:36.630> instead<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the addition of two campaigns instead of

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
the addition of two campaigns instead of
one<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.530> time<00:00:37.770> round<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.489> gives<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> lot

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
one this time round it gives you a lot

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
one this time round it gives you a lot
more<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.960> tutorial<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> step-by-step

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
more of a tutorial and a step-by-step

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.200 
more of a tutorial and a step-by-step
guide<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.500> how<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> control<00:00:44.010> planes<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.850> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
guide to how to control planes out of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
guide to how to control planes out of
control<00:00:45.570> submarines<00:00:46.170> boats<00:00:46.710> everything<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
control submarines boats everything and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
control submarines boats everything and
it<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.480> feels<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.840> once<00:00:49.170> you've<00:00:49.320> completed

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it just feels like once you've completed

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130 
it just feels like once you've completed
at<00:00:49.890> least<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.449> most<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
at least one that you know most of the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
at least one that you know most of the
things<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.730> on

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
things and then you know you can go on

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
things and then you know you can go on
to<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> next<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.480> bump<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> difficulty

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to the next one bump up the difficulty

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.729 
to the next one bump up the difficulty
and<00:00:55.980> you've<00:00:56.489> basically<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.500> stories<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and you've basically got two stories I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.540 
and you've basically got two stories I
guess<00:00:59.629> wrapped<00:01:00.629> around<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.079> tutorial<00:01:01.949> now

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
guess wrapped around this tutorial now

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
guess wrapped around this tutorial now
the<00:01:02.609> story<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> bit

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the story is actually it's just a bit

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
the story is actually it's just a bit
strange<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> did<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
strange really they kind of did this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.980 
strange really they kind of did this
weird<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.610> where<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:09.090> stick<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> cut

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
weird thing where they stick to cut

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
weird thing where they stick to cut
scenes<00:01:10.260> want<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> start<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.250> at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> end

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
scenes want to start one at the end

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
scenes want to start one at the end
giving<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.420> kind<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.750> briefly<00:01:13.290> oh<00:01:13.350> look<00:01:13.680> at

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
giving this kind of briefly oh look at

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
giving this kind of briefly oh look at
these<00:01:13.950> average<00:01:14.520> joes<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
these average joes and then this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:34.220 
these average joes and then this
butterfly<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> Japanese<00:01:17.610> campaign

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.420 

now<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.290> main<00:01:35.500> problem<00:01:35.890> with<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.100> single

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
now the main problem with the single

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.920 
now the main problem with the single
player<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.270> mission<00:01:37.450> structure

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
player is that the mission structure

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.050 
player is that the mission structure
it's<00:01:38.260> kind<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.620> just<00:01:38.770> thrown<00:01:39.430> together<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:40.000> mean

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
it's kind of just thrown together I mean

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's kind of just thrown together I mean
you'll<00:01:40.330> get<00:01:40.480> some<00:01:40.720> missions<00:01:41.020> where's<00:01:41.230> proper

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
you'll get some missions where's proper

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.110 
you'll get some missions where's proper
action<00:01:41.950> park<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.400> you'll<00:01:42.760> be<00:01:42.880> able<00:01:42.970> to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
action park and you'll be able to

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.830 
action park and you'll be able to
control<00:01:43.420> naval<00:01:43.930> units<00:01:44.380> air<00:01:44.680> unit<00:01:45.250> everything

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
control naval units air unit everything

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.330 
control naval units air unit everything
but<00:01:46.840> then<00:01:47.020> other<00:01:47.290> missions<00:01:48.100> you'll<00:01:48.310> be

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
but then other missions you'll be

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.580 
but then other missions you'll be
limited<00:01:48.970> like<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.510> submarine<00:01:49.990> mission<00:01:50.440> in

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
limited like the submarine mission in

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.200 
limited like the submarine mission in
the<00:01:50.920> Japanese<00:01:51.280> campaign<00:01:51.730> where<00:01:51.970> you're

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the Japanese campaign where you're

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.510 
the Japanese campaign where you're
sneaking<00:01:52.810> into<00:01:53.110> Sydney<00:01:53.680> Harbour<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.310> just

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
sneaking into Sydney Harbour it's just

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.430 
sneaking into Sydney Harbour it's just
boring<00:01:55.240> you're<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.660> literally<00:01:56.080> doing

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
boring you're just literally doing

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.680 
boring you're just literally doing
nothing<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:57.190> entire<00:01:57.520> mission<00:01:57.790> until<00:01:58.510> at<00:01:58.660> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
nothing the entire mission until at the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.360 
nothing the entire mission until at the
end<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:59.230> can<00:01:59.410> adjust<00:01:59.620> fire<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.130> couple

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
end you can adjust fire a couple

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.700 
end you can adjust fire a couple
torpedoes<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.210> done<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.500> like

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
torpedoes and done and it's just like

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.550 
torpedoes and done and it's just like
kind<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.220> weird<00:02:04.090> mishmash<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:05.020> all<00:02:05.350> these

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
kind of weird mishmash of all these

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.770 
kind of weird mishmash of all these
different<00:02:05.800> missions<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:07.030> kind<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.660> just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
different missions that kind of just

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.240 
different missions that kind of just
throw<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.110> off<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.710> there's<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:08.980> really<00:02:09.160> a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
throw you off and there's not really a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.300 
throw you off and there's not really a
constant<00:02:09.880> flow<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.570> also<00:02:11.530> some<00:02:11.830> missions<00:02:12.190> can

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
constant flow and also some missions can

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.950 
constant flow and also some missions can
just<00:02:12.520> seem<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.700> plot<00:02:13.090> along<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.810> just

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
just seem to plot along and you just

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.020 
just seem to plot along and you just
seem<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.380> traveling<00:02:15.280> through<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.640> ocean

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
seem to be traveling through the ocean

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.910 
seem to be traveling through the ocean
and<00:02:16.180> that's<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.200> seems<00:02:17.590> too

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and that's it and it just seems too

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.730 
and that's it and it just seems too
boring<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.820> monotonous<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.690> then<00:02:20.350> at<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
boring and monotonous but then at the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.530 
boring and monotonous but then at the
end<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.220> both<00:02:21.370> campaigns<00:02:21.820> you'll<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.330> these

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
end of both campaigns you'll get these

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
end of both campaigns you'll get these
kind<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.930> massive<00:02:23.800> battles<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.490> you'll<00:02:24.640> be

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
kind of massive battles that you'll be

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.910 
kind of massive battles that you'll be
taking<00:02:25.120> part<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.750> they're<00:02:25.990> really<00:02:26.590> fun

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
taking part in and they're really fun

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.370

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
but then there's those little missions

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.080 
but then there's those little missions
that<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.800> just<00:02:29.980> won't<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.430> out<00:02:30.550> your<00:02:30.760> head

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.199 

the<00:02:50.439> multiplayer<00:02:50.859> is<00:02:50.980> really<00:02:51.489> fun<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.909> offers

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
got jewel which is kind of like a four

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.349 
got jewel which is kind of like a four
versus<00:02:56.469> four<00:02:56.499> gears<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.129> war<00:02:57.280> style<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.700> rounds

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
versus four gears of war style of rounds

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.349 
versus four gears of war style of rounds
and<00:02:58.530> whoever<00:02:59.530> kills<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.639> other<00:03:00.790> team<00:03:01.090> off

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
and whoever kills the other team off

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.809 
and whoever kills the other team off
then<00:03:01.689> they<00:03:02.079> get<00:03:02.230> point<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.799> whoever<00:03:03.579> has<00:03:03.700> the

most points in the time allocated wins

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.759 
most points in the time allocated wins
but<00:03:06.939> then<00:03:07.060> you've<00:03:07.180> got<00:03:07.299> more<00:03:07.480> complexed<00:03:08.349> game

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
but then you've got more complexed game

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.399 
but then you've got more complexed game
modes<00:03:09.040> like<00:03:09.189> Island<00:03:10.000> capture<00:03:10.510> which<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.230> my

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
modes like Island capture which is my

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.440 
modes like Island capture which is my
personal<00:03:11.680> favorite<00:03:11.889> where<00:03:12.819> basically<00:03:13.329> you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
personal favorite where basically you

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.809 
personal favorite where basically you
get<00:03:13.719> any<00:03:14.019> unit<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.709> choose<00:03:14.950> from<00:03:15.159> when<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.459> get

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
get any unit to choose from when you get

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.449 
get any unit to choose from when you get
like<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.030> kind<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.560> command<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.709> point<00:03:17.950> limit

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
like a kind of command the point limit

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.009 
like a kind of command the point limit
and<00:03:18.669> you<00:03:18.730> just<00:03:18.939> build<00:03:19.120> whatever<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.569> want<00:03:19.840> and

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
and you just build whatever you want and

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.080 
and you just build whatever you want and

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
then you basically have to capture these

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.360 
then you basically have to capture these
islands<00:03:22.569> and<00:03:22.689> defend<00:03:23.019> them<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.709> gain<00:03:24.040> points

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
islands and defend them to gain points

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
islands and defend them to gain points
and<00:03:24.730> again<00:03:24.969> whoever<00:03:25.299> reaches<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.900> point<00:03:26.260> cap

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and again whoever reaches the point cap

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.209 
and again whoever reaches the point cap
wins<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.909> it<00:03:28.389> just<00:03:28.659> it<00:03:29.019> offers<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.379> lot<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:30.040> mean

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.219 
wins and it just it offers a lot I mean

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.819 
wins and it just it offers a lot I mean
it's<00:03:30.459> got<00:03:30.609> eight<00:03:30.819> maps<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.299> choose<00:03:31.599> from<00:03:31.870> but

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
it's got eight maps to choose from but

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.649 
it's got eight maps to choose from but
you<00:03:32.919> can<00:03:33.069> set<00:03:33.519> these<00:03:33.669> maps<00:03:33.969> to<00:03:34.150> be<00:03:34.269> small

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
you can set these maps to be small

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.110 
you can set these maps to be small
medium<00:03:35.230> or<00:03:35.319> large<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:36.129> technically<00:03:36.849> there

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
medium or large so technically there

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.179 
medium or large so technically there
could<00:03:37.329> be<00:03:37.359> 24<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.590> look<00:03:38.769> at<00:03:38.889> it<00:03:38.919> that<00:03:39.040> way

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
could be 24 if you look at it that way

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.179 
could be 24 if you look at it that way
all<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.090> units<00:03:40.389> carry<00:03:40.659> over<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.319> if<00:03:42.069> you

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
all the units carry over and if you

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.309 
all the units carry over and if you
unlock<00:03:42.519> some<00:03:42.790> units<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.329> single<00:03:43.629> player<00:03:43.810> you

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
unlock some units in a single player you

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.839 
unlock some units in a single player you
can<00:03:44.530> just<00:03:44.739> have<00:03:44.949> them<00:03:44.980> in<00:03:45.219> the<00:03:45.310> multiplayer<00:03:45.639> as

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
can just have them in the multiplayer as

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.750 
can just have them in the multiplayer as
well<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.689> it<00:03:47.019> kind<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.409> gives<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.949> that<00:03:48.099> drive
