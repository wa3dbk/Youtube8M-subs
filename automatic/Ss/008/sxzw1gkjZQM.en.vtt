00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
it's not like a unique fun one to go for

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.800 
it's not like a unique fun one to go for
it's<00:00:30.280> like<00:00:30.430> actually<00:00:30.940> a<00:00:30.970> real<00:00:31.420> real<00:00:31.780> real

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
challenge this like I said was not easy

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.979 
challenge this like I said was not easy
to<00:00:34.750> go<00:00:34.989> for<00:00:35.289> it<00:00:36.219> took<00:00:36.399> us<00:00:36.520> probably<00:00:36.600> 25<00:00:37.600> plus

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
to go for it took us probably 25 plus

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.259 
to go for it took us probably 25 plus
tries<00:00:38.519> definitely<00:00:39.519> a<00:00:39.579> decent<00:00:39.940> amount<00:00:39.999> of<00:00:40.149> time

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
tries definitely a decent amount of time

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.739 
tries definitely a decent amount of time
and<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.489> main<00:00:42.640> challenge<00:00:43.149> in<00:00:43.329> this<00:00:43.510> is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
and the main challenge in this is

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.419 
and the main challenge in this is
obviously<00:00:44.199> not<00:00:44.469> dying<00:00:44.769> now<00:00:44.949> you<00:00:45.010> guys<00:00:45.219> have

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
obviously not dying now you guys have

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.709 
obviously not dying now you guys have
seen<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:46.510> 75<00:00:47.379> -<00:00:47.620> OH<00:00:47.789> tedium<00:00:48.789> when<00:00:49.089> where

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
seen the 75 - OH tedium when where

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.799 
seen the 75 - OH tedium when where
carnage<00:00:50.140> invincible<00:00:50.769> got<00:00:50.949> all<00:00:51.309> 75<00:00:51.969> kills<00:00:52.479> and

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
carnage invincible got all 75 kills and

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.340 
carnage invincible got all 75 kills and
didn't<00:00:53.440> die<00:00:53.620> but<00:00:54.550> his<00:00:54.879> teammates<00:00:55.420> did<00:00:55.870> die<00:00:56.079> and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
didn't die but his teammates did die and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.579 
didn't die but his teammates did die and
the<00:00:57.039> enemy<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:58.210> know<00:00:58.329> got<00:00:58.629> score<00:00:59.049> from<00:00:59.289> doing

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
the enemy you know got score from doing

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.039 
the enemy you know got score from doing
that<00:00:59.799> but<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.549> idea<00:01:00.579> of<00:01:00.999> this<00:01:01.179> is<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.659> entire

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
that but the idea of this is the entire

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:07.380 
that but the idea of this is the entire
team<00:01:02.559> gets<00:01:03.460> kills<00:01:03.850> but<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.860> enemy<00:01:06.760> doesn't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
team gets kills but the enemy doesn't

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.390 
team gets kills but the enemy doesn't
get<00:01:07.510> any<00:01:07.630> kills<00:01:07.870> you<00:01:08.110> they<00:01:08.530> can't<00:01:08.799> they<00:01:09.070> you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
get any kills you they can't they you

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
get any kills you they can't they you
gotta<00:01:09.580> make<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:09.940> got<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.120> play<00:01:10.240> strategically

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
gotta make you got to play strategically

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.749 
gotta make you got to play strategically
so<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.049> they<00:01:11.229> can't<00:01:11.469> kill<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.460> idea

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
so that they can't kill you and the idea

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.999 
so that they can't kill you and the idea
is<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:13.060> win<00:01:13.240> flawlessly<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.350> it's<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.890> little

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
is to win flawlessly so it's a little

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.950 
is to win flawlessly so it's a little
bit<00:01:15.159> different<00:01:15.520> it's<00:01:15.670> kind<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.880> confusing<00:01:16.360> but

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
bit different it's kind of confusing but

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.870 
bit different it's kind of confusing but
you<00:01:17.200> should<00:01:17.409> be<00:01:17.469> able<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.619> figure<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:17.860> out

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
you should be able to figure that out

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.270 
you should be able to figure that out
model<00:01:19.780> for<00:01:19.960> three<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.320> probably<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.799> hardest

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
model for three is probably the hardest

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.730 
model for three is probably the hardest
game<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.610> get<00:01:21.789> this<00:01:21.909> on<00:01:22.119> because<00:01:23.020> or<00:01:23.409> maybe

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
game to get this on because or maybe

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.609 
game to get this on because or maybe
ghost<00:01:23.979> actually<00:01:24.280> as<00:01:24.490> well<00:01:24.719> but<00:01:25.719> black<00:01:26.140> ops<00:01:26.380> 1

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
ghost actually as well but black ops 1

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.359 
ghost actually as well but black ops 1
and<00:01:26.770> black<00:01:26.950> ops<00:01:27.159> 2<00:01:27.399> they<00:01:28.000> both<00:01:28.180> have<00:01:28.450> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and black ops 2 they both have the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.980 
and black ops 2 they both have the
orbital<00:01:30.369> V<00:01:30.490> says<00:01:30.759> so<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.090> V<00:01:31.210> set<00:01:31.450> makes<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.840> a

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
orbital V says so the V set makes this a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.109 
orbital V says so the V set makes this a
lot<00:01:32.350> easier<00:01:32.409> once<00:01:32.859> you<00:01:32.979> get<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.159> V<00:01:33.340> set<00:01:33.579> in<00:01:33.729> TDM

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
lot easier once you get a V set in TDM

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.599 
lot easier once you get a V set in TDM
on<00:01:34.329> those<00:01:34.840> games<00:01:35.140> it's<00:01:35.439> over<00:01:35.979> you'll<00:01:36.219> have<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
on those games it's over you'll have it

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.719 
on those games it's over you'll have it
once<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.090> get<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.920> model<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.490> 3<00:01:39.640> you

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
once you get that but in model for 3 you

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.609 
once you get that but in model for 3 you
don't<00:01:39.880> have<00:01:40.030> anything<00:01:40.359> really<00:01:40.570> like<00:01:40.899> that<00:01:41.140> you

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
don't have anything really like that you

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.560 
don't have anything really like that you
do<00:01:41.770> have<00:01:41.979> like<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.460> advanced<00:01:42.850> wave<00:01:43.090> ease<00:01:43.240> but

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
do have like the advanced wave ease but

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.940 
do have like the advanced wave ease but
it's<00:01:43.869> not<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.200> same<00:01:44.380> definitely<00:01:44.679> not<00:01:44.859> the

orbital fee set and the this challenge

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.230 
orbital fee set and the this challenge
is<00:02:17.830> really<00:02:18.040> hard<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.370> get<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> really<00:02:19.000> is

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
is really hard to get it really is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.790 
is really hard to get it really is
there's<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.570> lot<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> calling<00:02:20.260> out

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
there's a lot of calling out

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.760 
there's a lot of calling out
of<00:02:20.890> teamwork<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.820> have<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.120> set<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.720> play

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
of teamwork you have to set up and play

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.810 
of teamwork you have to set up and play
passively<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:24.070> can't<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.790> around

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
passively you can't just go around

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.670 
passively you can't just go around
Russian<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:25.630> not<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> work<00:02:26.170> unless

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
Russian that's not going to work unless

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.350 
Russian that's not going to work unless
you<00:02:26.830> get<00:02:26.950> completely<00:02:27.280> lucky<00:02:27.730> but<00:02:27.910> most<00:02:28.210> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
you get completely lucky but most the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.630 
you get completely lucky but most the
time<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:28.660> probably<00:02:28.750> never<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.380> happen

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
time it's probably never going to happen

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.040 
time it's probably never going to happen
you<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.880> play<00:02:31.300> passively<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:31.960> to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
you have to play passively you have to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.260 
you have to play passively you have to
set<00:02:32.200> yourself<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.800> head<00:02:33.010> glitches<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
set yourself up in head glitches and you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
set yourself up in head glitches and you
also<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.750> space<00:02:35.050> your<00:02:35.260> teammate<00:02:35.770> out

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
also have to space your teammate out

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.090 
also have to space your teammate out
teammates<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.870> different<00:02:38.200> spawn<00:02:38.740> areas

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
teammates out in different spawn areas

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.680 
teammates out in different spawn areas
so<00:02:39.310> as<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.700> see<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.150> guys<00:02:40.330> down<00:02:40.570> by

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
so as you can see we have guys down by

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.120 
so as you can see we have guys down by
the<00:02:40.750> bunker<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:41.140> have<00:02:41.230> guys<00:02:41.410> by<00:02:41.650> front<00:02:41.920> doors

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the bunker we have guys by front doors

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.610 
the bunker we have guys by front doors
we<00:02:42.370> have<00:02:42.520> guys<00:02:43.060> over<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.140> other<00:02:44.290> side<00:02:44.590> of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
we have guys over on the other side of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.900 
we have guys over on the other side of
the<00:02:44.770> map<00:02:44.890> from<00:02:45.040> where<00:02:45.430> you're<00:02:45.520> watching<00:02:45.790> right

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
the map from where you're watching right

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.150 
the map from where you're watching right
now<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.390> we're<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.470> playing<00:02:47.740> passively

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
now and we're just playing passively

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.440 
now and we're just playing passively
we're<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.550> kind<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.760> picking<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.180> enemies

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
we're just kind of picking the enemies

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.300 
we're just kind of picking the enemies
off<00:02:49.630> they<00:02:49.900> are<00:02:50.260> not<00:02:50.530> good<00:02:50.710> enough<00:02:50.890> players<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
off they are not good enough players to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.750 
off they are not good enough players to
counter<00:02:52.180> our<00:02:52.420> high<00:02:52.690> glitches<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.350> our

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
counter our high glitches and our

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.090 
counter our high glitches and our
strategic<00:02:54.760> placing<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.780> that's<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.650> you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
strategic placing so that's just you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.590 
strategic placing so that's just you
know<00:02:57.130> what<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.550> got<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.790> do<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.240> gameplay

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
know what you got to do for a gameplay

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.560 
know what you got to do for a gameplay
like<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:59.050> so<00:02:59.350> uh<00:03:00.070> like<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.880> said<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.240> did<00:03:01.420> take

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
like this so uh like I said it did take

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.840 
like this so uh like I said it did take
a<00:03:01.600> while<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.930> would<00:03:02.410> say<00:03:02.590> probably<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.010> 2025

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
a while I would say probably like 2025

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.120 
a while I would say probably like 2025
times<00:03:04.360> until<00:03:04.840> we<00:03:04.900> finally<00:03:05.290> got<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
times until we finally got it the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.310 
times until we finally got it the
closest<00:03:06.610> we<00:03:06.700> got<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.120> before<00:03:07.600> this<00:03:07.990> the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
closest we got to before this the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.050 
closest we got to before this the
actually<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:09.130> accomplishing<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.790> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
actually like accomplishing the the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.590 
actually like accomplishing the the
challenge<00:03:10.420> was<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.470> think<00:03:11.710> like<00:03:11.830> 60<00:03:12.550> 200<00:03:13.450> or

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
challenge was I think like 60 200 or

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.210 
challenge was I think like 60 200 or
something<00:03:13.720> like<00:03:13.990> that<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.830> was<00:03:14.950> fairly

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
something like that so it was fairly

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.450 
something like that so it was fairly
close<00:03:15.550> but<00:03:16.030> um<00:03:16.720> obviously<00:03:17.560> not<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.010> naughty

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
close but um obviously not the naughty

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.210 
close but um obviously not the naughty
of<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.480> actual<00:03:19.960> challenge<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.920> was<00:03:21.040> pretty

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
of the actual challenge so it was pretty

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.400 
of the actual challenge so it was pretty
cool<00:03:21.430> but<00:03:21.730> we<00:03:21.850> finally<00:03:22.090> got<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
cool but we finally got it

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.260 
cool but we finally got it
