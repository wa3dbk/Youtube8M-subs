00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
of the second period and at this point

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.340 
of the second period and at this point
it<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:38.220> those<00:02:38.910> pretty<00:02:39.120> bad<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.840> game<00:02:40.200> was

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
it was those pretty bad in the game was

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.780 
it was those pretty bad in the game was
pretty<00:02:40.470> even<00:02:40.860> i<00:02:41.040> would<00:02:41.190> say<00:02:41.370> i<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
pretty even i would say i think the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550 
pretty even i would say i think the
shots<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.360> second<00:02:42.630> period<00:02:42.750> was<00:02:42.930> mostly<00:02:43.260> me

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
shots the second period was mostly me

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.840 
shots the second period was mostly me
the<00:02:43.740> first<00:02:43.920> period<00:02:44.070> mostly<00:02:44.460> him<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.700> third

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the first period mostly him the third

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.850 
the first period mostly him the third
period<00:02:45.090> was<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> bit<00:02:45.540> more<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.810> his<00:02:45.930> favor<00:02:46.140> by

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
period was a bit more in his favor by

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.320 
period was a bit more in his favor by
the<00:02:46.920> second<00:02:47.250> period<00:02:47.400> i<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:47.760> i<00:02:47.850> played<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.120> bit

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the second period i think i played a bit

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
the second period i think i played a bit
better<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.320> result<00:02:49.650> was<00:02:49.770> him<00:02:50.460> i<00:02:50.580> believe

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
better but the result was him i believe

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.950 
better but the result was him i believe
he<00:02:50.820> got<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.030> goals<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.900> third

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
he got two goals to one and the third

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.480 
he got two goals to one and the third
period<00:02:52.290> nothing<00:02:52.800> really<00:02:53.010> happened<00:02:53.310> at<00:02:53.370> all

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
period nothing really happened at all

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.460 
period nothing really happened at all
sadly<00:02:53.790> i<00:02:54.180> don't<00:02:54.780> remember<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.050> exact<00:02:55.320> results

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
sadly i don't remember the exact results

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.350 
sadly i don't remember the exact results
of<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.920> third<00:02:56.070> period<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.670> all<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.910> do<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
of the third period but all I do know is

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.870 
of the third period but all I do know is
I<00:02:57.780> was<00:02:58.650> really<00:02:58.950> trying<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.370> tie<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.580> game<00:02:59.700> up

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
I was really trying to tie the game up

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.030 
I was really trying to tie the game up
and<00:03:00.240> it<00:03:00.720> did<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:00.960> work<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.350> me<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.860> go<00:03:02.010> all

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and it did not work out for me we go all

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.490 
and it did not work out for me we go all
the<00:03:02.490> way<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.670> 25<00:03:03.240> seconds<00:03:03.660> Ovechkin<00:03:04.140> skating

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the way to 25 seconds Ovechkin skating

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
the way to 25 seconds Ovechkin skating
up<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.860> he<00:03:05.370> tries<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.970> pass<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.390> in

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
up and he tries to just pass out in

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.580 
up and he tries to just pass out in
front<00:03:06.750> he<00:03:06.840> probably<00:03:07.140> could<00:03:07.380> have<00:03:07.410> tried

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
front he probably could have tried

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.840 
front he probably could have tried
sniping<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.310> might<00:03:08.490> have<00:03:08.580> worked<00:03:08.670> from

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
sniping it that might have worked from

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.520 
sniping it that might have worked from
Ovechkin<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:09.480> again<00:03:09.690> bishops<00:03:10.080> really<00:03:10.410> good

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
Ovechkin but again bishops really good

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
Ovechkin but again bishops really good
high<00:03:10.680> does<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.580> work<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:13.140> high<00:03:13.350> if

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
high does not work not a that high if

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.230 
high does not work not a that high if
you<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.740> what<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.890> mean<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.430> high<00:03:14.880> glove

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
you know what I mean but like high glove

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
and high blocker and stuff that probably

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.470 
and high blocker and stuff that probably
wouldn't<00:03:17.160> one<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.490> bore<00:03:17.700> goalie<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.240> the

wouldn't one in we bore goalie and the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.420 
wouldn't one in we bore goalie and the
second<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:18.930> pull<00:03:19.110> when<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.320> get<00:03:19.440> hit<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.770> then

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
second we pull when we get hit and then

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.880 
second we pull when we get hit and then
that's<00:03:20.670> going<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.030> GG<00:03:21.330> no<00:03:21.720> re<00:03:21.750> he<00:03:22.560> scores

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
that's going to be GG no re he scores

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.860 
that's going to be GG no re he scores
with<00:03:23.040> 8<00:03:23.190> seconds<00:03:23.580> left<00:03:23.850> on<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> open<00:03:24.420> net<00:03:24.600> and
