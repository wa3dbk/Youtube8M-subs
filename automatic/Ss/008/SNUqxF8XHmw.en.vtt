avalanche II so he didn't explain how to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450 
avalanche II so he didn't explain how to
perform<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.480> exploit<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:29.039> sure<00:00:29.220> why

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
me that there is an exploit out there so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
me that there is an exploit out there so
I<00:00:36.960> did<00:00:37.380> some<00:00:37.559> digging<00:00:37.739> after<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.520> research

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I did some digging after some research

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
I did some digging after some research
trying<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> combine<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.870> gear<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:41.340> not

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
sure if it was gear that was part of the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.040 
sure if it was gear that was part of the
exploit<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.730> skill<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.780> if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
exploit or if it was skill so it will if

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
exploit or if it was skill so it will if
it<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.469> Templar<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.280> something<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I wasn't sure so I did some digging I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
I wasn't sure so I did some digging I
tried<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> things<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.890> after<00:00:56.070> like

I believe it's one more time than the
exploit<00:04:21.270> should<00:04:21.450> work

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.190 
whole video I'm sure this is going to be
a<00:06:27.590> few<00:06:27.800> minutes<00:06:27.950> long<00:06:28.690> take<00:06:29.690> a<00:06:29.720> look<00:06:29.960> at<00:06:30.050> the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
a few minutes long take a look at the

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.110 
a few minutes long take a look at the
skills<00:06:30.530> I've<00:06:30.740> been<00:06:30.920> using<00:06:31.160> like<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.820> put<00:06:32.030> on

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
skills I've been using like to put on

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.620 
skills I've been using like to put on
war-cry<00:06:32.660> here<00:06:33.280> with<00:06:34.280> charge<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:35.090> just<00:06:35.300> do<00:06:35.450> this

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
war-cry here with charge to just do this

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.930 
war-cry here with charge to just do this
fast

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
fast

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.070 
fast
so<00:06:37.940> I<00:06:38.680> have<00:06:39.680> used<00:06:40.009> the<00:06:40.310> another<00:06:41.240> trick<00:06:41.569> I<00:06:41.870> did

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
so I have used the another trick I did

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.490 
so I have used the another trick I did
was<00:06:42.379> to<00:06:42.639> take<00:06:43.639> my<00:06:43.819> maximum<00:06:44.210> fury<00:06:44.569> up<00:06:44.810> so<00:06:45.289> this

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
was to take my maximum fury up so this

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.010 
was to take my maximum fury up so this
goes<00:06:45.740> faster<00:06:46.280> you<00:06:46.550> can<00:06:46.699> put<00:06:47.240> this<00:06:47.389> on<00:06:47.569> like<00:06:47.810> I

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
goes faster you can put this on like I

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.260 
goes faster you can put this on like I
can<00:06:48.409> I<00:06:48.530> could<00:06:48.710> have<00:06:48.800> maximized<00:06:49.580> this<00:06:49.819> and<00:06:50.090> put

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
can I could have maximized this and put

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.309 
can I could have maximized this and put
on<00:06:50.389> stone<00:06:51.050> of<00:06:51.199> Jordan<00:06:51.620> just<00:06:51.949> to<00:06:52.099> like<00:06:52.280> gets<00:06:52.669> a

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
on stone of Jordan just to like gets a

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.680 
on stone of Jordan just to like gets a
bit<00:06:54.319> more<00:06:54.590> I<00:06:54.889> mean<00:06:55.370> like<00:06:55.699> this<00:06:55.970> goes<00:06:56.210> fast<00:06:56.569> I

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
bit more I mean like this goes fast I

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.200 
bit more I mean like this goes fast I
could<00:06:56.870> just<00:06:57.050> done<00:06:57.770> that<00:06:58.039> and<00:07:00.729> just<00:07:01.729> spend<00:07:01.970> all

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
could just done that and just spend all

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.680 
could just done that and just spend all
the<00:07:02.360> fury<00:07:02.599> so<00:07:02.930> use<00:07:03.620> 750<00:07:04.430> let<00:07:04.639> me<00:07:04.729> check<00:07:05.060> how

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
the fury so use 750 let me check how

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.439 
the fury so use 750 let me check how
many<00:07:05.750> times<00:07:06.229> you<00:07:06.440> can<00:07:06.560> use<00:07:06.770> this<00:07:10.150> as<00:07:11.150> you<00:07:11.389> can

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:11.449 
many times you can use this as you can

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.360 
many times you can use this as you can
see<00:07:11.690> it<00:07:11.810> stopped<00:07:12.050> working<00:07:12.199> you<00:07:12.770> have<00:07:12.979> to<00:07:13.039> do

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
see it stopped working you have to do

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.969 
see it stopped working you have to do
with<00:07:13.550> this<00:07:13.729> once<00:07:14.240> just<00:07:14.569> click<00:07:14.900> one<00:07:15.349> one<00:07:15.740> time

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
with this once just click one one time

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.189 
with this once just click one one time
do<00:07:16.219> not<00:07:16.250> use<00:07:16.580> it<00:07:16.759> twice<00:07:16.969> the<00:07:17.599> Avalanche<00:07:17.930> you<00:07:17.990> do

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 
do not use it twice the Avalanche you do

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.050 
do not use it twice the Avalanche you do
not<00:07:18.319> use<00:07:18.530> it<00:07:18.650> twice<00:07:18.770> because<00:07:19.129> that<00:07:19.280> when<00:07:19.909> it

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
not use it twice because that when it

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.010 
not use it twice because that when it
will<00:07:20.210> stop<00:07:20.539> working<00:07:20.960> so<00:07:22.360> hopefully<00:07:23.360> you

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
will stop working so hopefully you

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.899 
will stop working so hopefully you
learned<00:07:24.229> a<00:07:24.379> bit<00:07:24.530> from<00:07:24.770> this<00:07:24.979> and<00:07:25.310> hopefully

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:25.909 
learned a bit from this and hopefully

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.390 
learned a bit from this and hopefully
this<00:07:26.210> will<00:07:26.360> be<00:07:26.509> patched<00:07:26.840> I<00:07:27.560> will<00:07:28.039> see<00:07:28.250> you<00:07:28.340> guys

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
this will be patched I will see you guys

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.899 
this will be patched I will see you guys
soon

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:28.909 
soon

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:33.159 
soon
maybe<00:07:29.300> another<00:07:29.599> exploits<00:07:30.169> depends<00:07:31.000> on<00:07:32.139> what<00:07:33.139> I

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
maybe another exploits depends on what I

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:37.719 
maybe another exploits depends on what I
do<00:07:35.560> but<00:07:36.560> I<00:07:36.860> will<00:07:37.009> be<00:07:37.250> coming<00:07:37.430> with<00:07:37.580> new

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:37.729 
do but I will be coming with new

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.300 
do but I will be coming with new
exploits
