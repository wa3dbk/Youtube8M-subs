right now it's a little under half full
I'll<00:00:23.039> need<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> fill<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:24.029> again<00:00:24.300> pretty

soon and hopefully I'll remember to
record<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:27.990> show<00:00:28.140> people

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
record that so that I can show people

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
record that so that I can show people
the<00:00:28.859> process<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.750> back<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:33.059> hopefully

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you'll be able to see it's probably a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.330 
you'll be able to see it's probably a
little<00:00:35.190> dark<00:00:35.520> I've<00:00:36.210> got<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.530> lines

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
little dark I've got the the lines

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.330 
little dark I've got the the lines
coming<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:40.500> line<00:00:40.710> coming<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> going

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
coming in and the line coming and going

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
coming in and the line coming and going
at<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:41.700> bottom<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.239> line<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.140> through

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
at the very bottom a line going through

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.330 
at the very bottom a line going through
for<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.110> cold<00:00:46.110> water<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> line<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.070> for

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
for the cold water and a line going for

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.709 
for the cold water and a line going for
the<00:00:47.399> hot<00:00:47.610> water<00:00:49.399> all<00:00:50.399> those<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:51.390> going

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the hot water all those the line going

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.000 
the hot water all those the line going
in<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.530> comes<00:00:52.800> through<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.590> comes<00:00:55.590> into

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in actually comes through and comes into

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880 
in actually comes through and comes into
the<00:00:56.129> water<00:00:56.489> tank<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> back<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the water tank at the back and then the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
the water tank at the back and then the
water<00:00:59.129> tank<00:00:59.570> comes<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.390> got

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
water tank comes out here and then I got

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
water tank comes out here and then I got
access<00:01:03.989> steel<00:01:04.199> braided<00:01:04.379> pipe<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
access steel braided pipe so make it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.760 
access steel braided pipe so make it
easier<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.489> me<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.299> hook<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.869> pump<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
easier for me to to hook up the pump is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
easier for me to to hook up the pump is
actually<00:01:08.130> underneath<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.939> water<00:01:09.150> tank<00:01:09.510> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
actually underneath the water tank I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.460 
actually underneath the water tank I
can't<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:12.470> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
can't really get to it right now but so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
can't really get to it right now but so
the<00:01:14.040> pump<00:01:14.520> sucks<00:01:14.790> everything<00:01:15.000> under<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the pump sucks everything under the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
the pump sucks everything under the
water<00:01:15.450> tank<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:15.869> there's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> manifold

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
water tank and then there's a manifold

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
water tank and then there's a manifold
that<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> built<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:20.090> distributes<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> water

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that I built that distributes the water

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
that I built that distributes the water
to<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.320> cold<00:01:22.729> which<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:25.100> line<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.580> here

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to the cold which is line going up here

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.819 
to the cold which is line going up here
in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> back<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.670> also<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> hot<00:01:30.390> which

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
in the back and also to the hot which

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.050 
in the back and also to the hot which
goes<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> hot<00:01:32.220> water<00:01:32.430> heater<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
goes to the hot water heater which is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
goes to the hot water heater which is
this<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this thing right here and then that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.350 
this thing right here and then that
comes<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> top<00:01:35.520> goes<00:01:36.030> through<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
comes out the top goes through there and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
comes out the top goes through there and
comes<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> line<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:40.520> hooks

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
comes out the line there that all hooks

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.859 
comes out the line there that all hooks
up<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.079> sink<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.380> kitchen<00:01:43.680> sink<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> shower

so<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.740> had<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.130> cut<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> hole<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
so I actually had to cut a hole in the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.550 
so I actually had to cut a hole in the
top<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.240> tank<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.720> put<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.020> fittings<00:02:13.440> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
top of the tank to put in fittings I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
top of the tank to put in fittings I
felt<00:02:13.770> more<00:02:13.890> comfortable<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.170> instead

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
felt more comfortable with and instead

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.240 
felt more comfortable with and instead
of<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.530> know<00:02:16.560> patching<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.980> hole<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
of just you know patching a hole I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.920 
of just you know patching a hole I
actually<00:02:17.580> left<00:02:18.060> little<00:02:18.270> access<00:02:18.600> port<00:02:18.810> which

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
actually left little access port which

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
actually left little access port which
is<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> good<00:02:19.230> thing<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:20.280> I'm<00:02:20.400> in

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
is a good thing because when I'm in

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.760 
is a good thing because when I'm in
place<00:02:21.600> where<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> can't<00:02:22.290> really<00:02:22.500> get

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
place where I can't really get

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.870 
place where I can't really get
pressurized<00:02:23.280> water<00:02:24.440> easily<00:02:25.440> i<00:02:25.980> actually<00:02:26.850> just

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
pressurized water easily i actually just

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.060 
pressurized water easily i actually just
take<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.960> canister<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.500> run<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> hose

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
take a little canister and run a hose

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.700 
take a little canister and run a hose
down<00:02:29.430> from<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> top<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.710> countertop

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
down from the top of the countertop

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.160 
down from the top of the countertop
there<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.160> fill<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.300> water<00:02:33.600> tank<00:02:33.690> through

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
there and fill the water tank through

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.050 
there and fill the water tank through
that<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:35.160> take<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.430> plug<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:35.790> fill<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that just take that plug out fill the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.820 
that just take that plug out fill the
water<00:02:36.210> tank<00:02:36.300> through<00:02:36.600> there<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.380> rest<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
water tank through there the rest of the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.140 
water tank through there the rest of the
time<00:02:38.040> when<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> do<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.730> access<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
time when I do have access to

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760 
time when I do have access to
pressurized<00:02:39.540> water<00:02:39.720> i<00:02:40.050> hook<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.350> with<00:02:40.500> spigot

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
pressurized water i hook up with spigot

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.110 
pressurized water i hook up with spigot
outside<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.330> pushes<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.780> water<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.260> and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
outside and it pushes the water in and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.150 
outside and it pushes the water in and
it<00:02:45.120> comes<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.480> through<00:02:45.720> through<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.710> bottom

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
it comes in through through that bottom

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.740 
it comes in through through that bottom
line<00:02:47.460> which<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> probably<00:02:48.000> can't<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
line which you probably can't see is

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.590 
line which you probably can't see is
probably<00:02:49.110> too<00:02:49.350> dark<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.270> water

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
probably too dark but that is the water

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.500 
probably too dark but that is the water
hookup<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.140> tiny<00:02:52.320> house
