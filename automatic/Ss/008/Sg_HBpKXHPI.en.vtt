00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.660 
this is a review of the cowboy studio
radio<00:00:04.890> triggers<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:06.080> receivers<00:00:07.309> these<00:00:08.309> are

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
radio triggers and receivers these are

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.060 
radio triggers and receivers these are
my<00:00:08.790> favorite<00:00:09.420> triggers<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> use<00:00:10.710> all<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
my favorite triggers that I use all the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.620 
my favorite triggers that I use all the
time<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.670> find<00:00:11.910> my<00:00:12.090> flash<00:00:14.000> when<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.089> press<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
time to find my flash when you press the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.670 
time to find my flash when you press the
trigger<00:00:16.170> these<00:00:17.160> receivers<00:00:18.260> respond<00:00:19.260> with<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
trigger these receivers respond with the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.939 
trigger these receivers respond with the
red<00:00:19.890> light<00:00:20.810> as<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.350> they<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.680> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
red light as you can see they are in

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.679 
red light as you can see they are in
sync<00:00:26.930> what<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.130> mount<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
sync what you do is you mount the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.860 
sync what you do is you mount the
receiver<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> bottom<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> flash<00:00:32.870> lock

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
receiver on the bottom of the flash lock

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
receiver on the bottom of the flash lock
it<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:35.340> turn<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:37.129> it's<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it in and turn it on it's really that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
it in and turn it on it's really that
simple<00:00:39.260> as<00:00:40.879> these<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.180> manual<00:00:42.780> triggers<00:00:43.230> they

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
simple as these are manual triggers they

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
simple as these are manual triggers they
do<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.550> work<00:00:44.760> flashes<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.450> TTL<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> have

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
do not work flashes in TTL so you have

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.100 
do not work flashes in TTL so you have
to<00:00:46.739> set<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.190> flashes<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> manual<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> set

things can go anywhere and they all

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.830 
things can go anywhere and they all
figured<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.369> trigger<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.210> mounts<00:01:21.630> on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
figured with this trigger that mounts on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.399 
figured with this trigger that mounts on
your<00:01:22.020> camera<00:01:22.409> hot<00:01:22.650> shoot<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> cowboy<00:01:25.110> studio

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
your camera hot shoot the cowboy studio

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.730 
your camera hot shoot the cowboy studio
triggers<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> sync<00:01:26.820> speed<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.299> 250<00:01:28.259> which

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
triggers have a sync speed of 250 which

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.520 
triggers have a sync speed of 250 which
is<00:01:28.890> good<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.310> most<00:01:29.460> canvas<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.960> setting<00:01:31.320> your

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
is good for most canvas so setting your

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.859 
is good for most canvas so setting your
shutter<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:32.100> 250<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.420> problem<00:01:33.900> here

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
shutter at 250 will be no problem here

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.289 
shutter at 250 will be no problem here
in<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:35.530> demonstration<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.549> set<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.939> speed

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
in this demonstration I set a speed

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.649 
in this demonstration I set a speed
light<00:01:37.570> on<00:01:37.810> top<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.289> stand<00:01:38.710> about<00:01:39.390> 150<00:01:40.390> feet

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
light on top of a stand about 150 feet

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.499 
light on top of a stand about 150 feet
in<00:01:40.929> front<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:41.560> camera<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.179> see<00:01:43.390> if

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
in front of the camera just to see if

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.760 
in front of the camera just to see if
the<00:01:43.659> trigger<00:01:44.469> reaches<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.340> receiver<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:50.350> you

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
the trigger reaches the receiver as you

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.609 
the trigger reaches the receiver as you
can<00:01:50.920> see<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.340> fires<00:01:51.729> now<00:01:52.600> right<00:01:53.110> about<00:01:53.350> there

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
can see it fires now right about there

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.590 
can see it fires now right about there
is<00:01:53.860> about<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.340> max<00:01:54.640> range<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.450> these

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
is about the max range for these

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.550 
is about the max range for these
triggers<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.939> receivers<00:01:58.569> are<00:01:58.719> also<00:01:59.079> equipped

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
triggers the receivers are also equipped

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.949 
triggers the receivers are also equipped
with<00:01:59.679> a<00:01:59.770> flash<00:02:00.219> sync<00:02:00.670> port<00:02:01.030> which<00:02:01.569> makes<00:02:01.840> it

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
with a flash sync port which makes it

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.169 
with a flash sync port which makes it
easy<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.439> connect<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.159> other<00:02:03.369> studio<00:02:03.880> lighting

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
receivers this is what I use all the

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.990 
receivers this is what I use all the
time<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.720> trigger<00:02:17.049> my<00:02:17.230> flashes<00:02:17.829> I<00:02:18.069> don't<00:02:18.730> own

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000

with these I don't see a reason to own
them<00:02:24.879> as<00:02:25.090> these<00:02:25.780> fire<00:02:26.190> 100%<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> time<00:02:27.610> and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
them as these fire 100% of the time and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.800 
them as these fire 100% of the time and
usually<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.459> for<00:02:31.120> about<00:02:31.329> a<00:02:31.360> hundred<00:02:31.599> and
