00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
uh-huh yep does the color have been all

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.090 
uh-huh yep does the color have been all
the<00:00:04.350> way<00:00:04.470> down

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:39.069 

Wow<00:00:10.330> fascinating<00:00:11.330> we're<00:00:11.660> like<00:00:11.780> right<00:00:11.960> below

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.150 

and<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.440> there's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.860> step

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and I think there's a little step

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.959 
and I think there's a little step
there's<00:00:41.670> old<00:00:41.790> threshold<00:00:42.239> right<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.590> come<00:00:43.590> on

TJ yes walk straight straight but don't

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:41.330 
TJ yes walk straight straight but don't
touch<00:00:52.829> anything<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> big

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
touch anything and you see the big

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
touch anything and you see the big
bumpers<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.000> CJ<00:01:42.409> these<00:01:43.409> are<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.710> will

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
bumpers here at CJ these are what will

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
bumpers here at CJ these are what will
stop<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> car<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.850> an<00:01:45.479> emergency<00:01:45.750> they're

stop the car in an emergency they're
like<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> big<00:01:46.619> shock<00:01:47.130> absorber<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.759> take<00:01:47.880> all

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like a big shock absorber will take all

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
like a big shock absorber will take all
that<00:01:48.210> weight<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> car<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> transfer<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that weight of the car and transfer to

these hydraulic buffer sauces again

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
these hydraulic buffer sauces again
it'll<00:01:52.920> stop<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.250> car<00:01:53.549> smoothly<00:01:53.880> hydraulic

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
well this is the tail end ship with a

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.899 
well this is the tail end ship with a
weight<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:54.919> and<00:02:55.069> that's<00:02:55.220> where<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.459> cable

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
weight on it and that's where that cable

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.699 
weight on it and that's where that cable
turns<00:02:56.329> around<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> goes<00:02:56.810> back<00:02:57.049> up<00:02:57.109> it<00:02:57.530> meets

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
turns around and goes back up it meets

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.289 
turns around and goes back up it meets
the<00:02:57.859> elevator<00:02:58.250> that's<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.090> emergency

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299

braking<00:02:59.810> system<00:03:01.209> hey<00:03:02.209> what<00:03:02.480> up

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
braking system hey what up

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.679 
braking system hey what up
that's<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.889> Academy<00:03:04.489> itself<00:03:05.060> about<00:03:05.329> half<00:03:05.510> way

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
that's the Academy itself about half way

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.479 
that's the Academy itself about half way
now<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.319> those<00:03:06.470> two<00:03:06.709> cables<00:03:07.129> over<00:03:07.340> there

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
now so those two cables over there

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.580 
now so those two cables over there
there's<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.239> hook<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.659> that<00:03:08.810> little<00:03:09.019> that's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:34.050 

pretty<00:03:12.590> common
