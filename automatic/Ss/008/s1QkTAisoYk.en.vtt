00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 this is the leap for greater hsn is a 3d 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.990
 printer with a minimal print larger 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.220
 of only 20 microns 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 and through their own developments and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.250
 for example, talk about the lighter 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.170
 making the print head with my kilo 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 can get a maximum speed from this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 300 mm per second 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.210
 with which you can prototype even faster 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.800
 can save a lot of time 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 am your projects 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.369
 well to give you an example of how 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 fine that is 20 microns we have one here 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 3d printed diamond 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 and if you look at it you see that you 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.560
 almost no armies can see in that anymore 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.140
 printed objects well I printer that is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 great it is the extremely starched ge and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.770
 robust printer that is really robust 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.559
 that really makes it a little bit 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 the tank among the 3d printers 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 but you have consistency 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.809
 I have my standard A4 here 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 and if I keep making you get 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.980
 an idea of ​​how big this printer is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.649
 actually he has it too 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.510
 an unwise printed volume namely 14.1 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.660
 liter and in centimeters 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.059
 that 29 will be at 27 to 18 centimeters 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.899
 really nothing too crazy with this printer 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.340
 it is suitable for various 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.470
 fina types of instruments and have the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.049
 For example about ABS you are late PVDA 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.790
 nylon must be plastic and a brit plastic 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.100
 much more and that is what makes this printer 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.060
 a really versatile machine 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.920
 He has also been developed for the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.900
 future and by that I mean that the mar 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 will continue to develop with new ones 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.710
 materials and it is built on this one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.150
 also later with these new materials 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 can handle 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.210
 it comes standard with 2 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.409
 printheads and that means you 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.759
 can get started right away with it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 combine different types 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 foundation which is very handy for example 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 is soluble when printing 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.299
 support with floating parts 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.610
 then, for example , talk about this 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.890
 where you can see the one head it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.360
 soluble part and you can do that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.710
 very easy without tools 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.299
 remove along simply below the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.259
 keep warm tap 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.060
 In addition, you can also be very nice 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.979
 experiment with different colors 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 or for example with hard and soft 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.479
 materials so that you have all your creativity 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.250
 can be lost and this printer is supplied 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.750
 with professional software so that you can 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 a button is actually ready 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.909
 to print 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.680
 but of course you can also do all 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.030
 set settings as desired to the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.189
 printing really to the extreme 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.990
 use as well who also was 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.430
 once as a standalone printer and that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.320
 means that he can print without the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.849
 intervention of a laptop or computer 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.929
 by using the full color 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.790
 4 in screen 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.909
 the front is and with that you can directly 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.560
 print from any kind of usb stick it 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.420
 bed that is in it is a heated bed 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.620
 with a sticker so you are ready 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.969
 and never suffer from it again 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.680
 deformation 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.780
 would you like to know more about this 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.250
 unwise fat 3d printer or would you be there 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.439
 want to buy one right away 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.510
 we go to the 3d printer specialist.nl 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.680
 point b but you can always ask for advice 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.680
 filming along in one of our stores
