 we cut off from each two equal pieces 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:10.090
 form of them large droplets 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.090
 droplets flatten we make ears out of them 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.240
 it should make two legs and droplets 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.200
 two ears 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.200
