to<00:00:56.100> mention<00:00:56.220> to<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.750> are

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
to mention to you is that if you are

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.690 
to mention to you is that if you are

you've created that do specific things

this<00:01:27.840> makes<00:01:28.140> particle<00:01:28.950> playground<00:01:29.340> quite<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
this makes particle playground quite a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.490 
this makes particle playground quite a
bit<00:01:29.970> more<00:01:30.090> flexible<00:01:30.659> than<00:01:30.840> other<00:01:30.990> particle

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
bit more flexible than other particle

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.440 
bit more flexible than other particle
systems<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.310> also<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.640> makes<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.150> little

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
systems but also it makes it a little

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.080 
systems but also it makes it a little
bit<00:01:33.600> more<00:01:33.750> difficult<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:35.010> into<00:01:35.220> because

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
bit more difficult to get into because

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
bit more difficult to get into because
this<00:01:36.659> concept<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.260> property<00:01:37.440> maps<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
this concept of property maps is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
this concept of property maps is
something<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.790> everyone<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> familiar

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
something that not everyone is familiar

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.590 
something that not everyone is familiar
with<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:41.310> property<00:01:41.850> maps<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.420> do

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
with but with property maps you can do

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.149 
with but with property maps you can do
very<00:01:42.930> powerful<00:01:43.440> things<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.950> these

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
very powerful things with these

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
very powerful things with these
particles<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.150> you<00:01:45.299> can't<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.049> ordinary

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
particles that you can't do in ordinary

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
particles that you can't do in ordinary
particle<00:01:46.950> systems<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> concept<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
particle systems and so the concept of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
particle systems and so the concept of
property<00:01:48.810> maps<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> an<00:01:49.500> important<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
property maps is an important one that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
property maps is an important one that
we<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.090> looking<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.840> detail<00:01:52.560> later<00:01:52.770> on

now one last thing I want to show you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.080 
now one last thing I want to show you
and<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.979> fact<00:01:56.100> we'll<00:01:56.310> stop<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.000> we'll

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and in fact we'll stop this and we'll

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.820 
and in fact we'll stop this and we'll
look<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.330> another<00:01:57.570> type<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.960> particle<00:01:58.500> system

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
look at another type of particle system

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.370 
look at another type of particle system

a kind of quasi natural way when they
bang<00:03:07.650> into<00:03:07.680> each<00:03:07.950> other<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.940> by<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> same

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
bang into each other but by the same

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.319 
bang into each other but by the same
token<00:03:10.140> when<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.430> multiple<00:03:11.700> particles

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
token when you have multiple particles

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.240 
token when you have multiple particles
colliding<00:03:12.870> together<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.099> have

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
colliding together you can have

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.699 
colliding together you can have
ultimately<00:03:14.849> very<00:03:15.150> complex<00:03:15.900> interactions

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709

ultimately very complex interactions
between<00:03:16.890> those<00:03:17.280> particles<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.680> what<00:03:19.680> this

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
between those particles so what this

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.110 
between those particles so what this
means<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.489> don't<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.730> quite<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
means is that you don't have quite the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.180 
means is that you don't have quite the
same<00:03:21.239> amount<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.810> freedom<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.440> jumping

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
and so the longer it will take to

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.409

previous frame data sometimes isn't

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.770 
previous frame data sometimes isn't

in<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.859> particle<00:03:59.250> settings<00:03:59.819> can<00:04:00.030> invalidate

in the particle settings can invalidate

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.319 
in the particle settings can invalidate
all<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.139> previous<00:04:01.590> frames<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.370> very<00:04:02.970> often

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
all the previous frames so very often

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.330 
all the previous frames so very often
you<00:04:03.480> need<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:04.109> patient<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.739> avoid

you need to just be patient and avoid

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
maybe cached some of the original frames

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.599 
maybe cached some of the original frames
in<00:04:11.730> RAM<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.799> also<00:04:14.010> means<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.400> in

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
in RAM so this also means that in

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.580 
in RAM so this also means that in
general<00:04:14.910> render<00:04:15.690> times<00:04:15.930> will<00:04:16.139> gradually

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
general render times will gradually

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.640 
general render times will gradually
increase<00:04:16.919> as<00:04:17.549> your<00:04:17.910> render<00:04:18.299> progresses<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.530> if

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
increase as your render progresses so if

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.199 
increase as your render progresses so if
you<00:04:19.799> set<00:04:20.039> something<00:04:20.280> into<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.729> render<00:04:21.030> queue

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
you set something into the render queue

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.050 
you set something into the render queue
the<00:04:22.340> estimation<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.490> you'll<00:04:23.639> get<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.969> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
the estimation that you'll get of the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.000 
the estimation that you'll get of the
render<00:04:24.360> time<00:04:24.539> at<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.169> beginning<00:04:25.620> will

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
render time at the beginning will

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.219 
render time at the beginning will
actually<00:04:26.430> not<00:04:26.610> almost<00:04:27.150> certainly<00:04:27.690> not<00:04:27.960> be

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
actually not almost certainly not be

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.649 
actually not almost certainly not be
accurate<00:04:28.740> because<00:04:29.430> again<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.090> takes<00:04:30.330> longer

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
accurate because again it takes longer

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.540 
accurate because again it takes longer
to<00:04:30.900> calculate<00:04:31.380> those<00:04:31.590> later<00:04:31.830> frames<00:04:32.219> than<00:04:32.460> it

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
to calculate those later frames than it

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.370 
to calculate those later frames than it
does<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.820> earlier<00:04:33.120> frames<00:04:33.419> so<00:04:33.990> generally

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
does the earlier frames so generally

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.600 
does the earlier frames so generally
speaking<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.890> render<00:04:35.159> is<00:04:35.250> going<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.460> get
