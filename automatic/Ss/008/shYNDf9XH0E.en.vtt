00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.620 
good morning and welcome to my life I've
been<00:00:11.049> trying<00:00:11.710> to<00:00:12.040> write<00:00:12.250> a<00:00:12.280> blog<00:00:12.549> post

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.330 

inside<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.870> apartment<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.500> also<00:00:16.920> like

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
inside of my apartment and also like

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.540 
inside of my apartment and also like
what<00:00:17.580> I'm<00:00:17.700> doing<00:00:17.869> but<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.230> can't<00:00:19.890> seem<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.310> get

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
what I'm doing but I can't seem to get

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.660 
what I'm doing but I can't seem to get
myself<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> write<00:00:21.390> anything<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> figured

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
myself to write anything so I figured

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
myself to write anything so I figured
instead<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> would<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:24.960> better<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.290> all<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
instead it would be better for all of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
instead it would be better for all of
you<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.340> me<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> wake<00:00:27.450> up<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.779> the
