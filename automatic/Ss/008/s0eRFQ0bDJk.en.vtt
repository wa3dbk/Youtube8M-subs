00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.979
 the couple here the profession of physics of the college and course there already takes its 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.480
 I'm here to give you tips and important facts about the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.059
 what 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.209
 about enem 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.130
 A lot of people do not talk about neuer. 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.449
 but we must talk eva longoria already boot of gold 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.199
 so pay attention 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.699
 I did not follow that traditional vestibular line 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.009
 traditional vestibular physics questions of fernandÃ£o forget that the 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.519
 enem brings a vision a view of texas purpose ie akesson signing 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.449
 several subjects to a single question well you have to have more skill 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.520
 such as the physics discipline 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.030
 The zip code is known a lot and it leaves. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.359
 almost right 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.079
 it's the energy issue 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.750
 in two days in various types 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.859
 I will make the survey is that of some kind of energy and the connection that has 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.610
 between them 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.760
 there is a type of energy estimated mechanical energy 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.140
 rejane cantoni they are divided into three types 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.890
 the kinetic energy 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.760
 potential energy 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.770
 gravitational potential and elastic potential energy 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.110
 these first two 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.020
 have an ego of greater importance with regard to the elaboration of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 energetic issues, for example kinetic energy is one that all the time of the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.510
 particle motion that has motion 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.040
 with what we have better 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.100
 will have a mechanical energy called kinetic energy 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.080
 the gravitational potential energy is that energy relative to the height then 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.530
 its lower threshold a lower benchmark while 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.039
 above this reference level 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.140
 it will have stored energy 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 called the gravitational potential energy 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.840
 but I will not help people know 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.750
 fortunate to define these two types of energy 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.330
 this mechanical energy 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.320
 not that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.800
 in the connection it has in other types of energy 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.320
 for example the electric energy 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.970
 the jelly that it can be originated party- mg mechanical 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.940
 yea 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.140
 thermal energy how does it work the july effect 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.090
 what kind of energy 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.379
 with the association between them he has to make that connection 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.659
 Why the emelec or this contextualization 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.139
 so pay attention 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.299
 in a great time for example you have the generation of electricity or energy 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.509
 the part of what kind of energy 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.079
 of mechanical origin 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.209
 then the mechanical energy of water 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.459
 she will make it 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.249
 produce electricity 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.750
 right through the generation of a generator or turbines 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.779
 I appreciate it 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:37.629
 then you have the transformation of mechanical energy electrical energy 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.950
 but not forgetting 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.989
 whereas this system in practice 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.299
 is not the conservative system 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.099
 and what is a conservative system of amnesty 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.239
 is one in which, however, a time when all 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.319
 3 1 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.429
 the energy has remained ineffective and we can be sure of what 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.969
 at any moment 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.929
 there was a loss of energy 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.339
 transvestite 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:05.299
 from the owner of the car or through another type of energy 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:08.320
 but attention in practice 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.549
 the conservation of energy 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.929
 difficult to happen 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:17.039
 7 now theoretically we can consider this conservation 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.809
 depends on what he puts into the question 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.119
 so we pay close attention 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.070
 In this country, the concept of energy takes a little look 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.500
 the enemy certainly has to put something about it contextualizing 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.140
 with the goal the inter destabilizing with others in the case of that plenas 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.279
 mathematical chemistry 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.719
 sure if we are going to some energy concept 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.289
 of the big river and we are very important a hug
