00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
what's up guys I'm Kyle and in this

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.530 
what's up guys I'm Kyle and in this
video<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:02.730> taking<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> look<00:00:03.149> at<00:00:03.330> the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
video we're taking a look at the

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.010 
video we're taking a look at the
on-the-go<00:00:04.350> case<00:00:04.680> from<00:00:05.040> on-the-go<00:00:06.000> cases<00:00:06.810> this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
on-the-go case from on-the-go cases this

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.680 
on-the-go case from on-the-go cases this
is<00:00:07.080> their<00:00:07.410> large<00:00:07.890> case<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:09.210> designed<00:00:09.540> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
is their large case and it's designed to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.410 
is their large case and it's designed to
hold<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.320> lot<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.920> your<00:00:11.160> GoPro<00:00:11.610> stuff<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.179> keep

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hold a lot of your GoPro stuff and keep

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.530 
hold a lot of your GoPro stuff and keep
it<00:00:12.630> organized<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.460> outside<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.240> very

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
it organized so on the outside it's very

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.330 
it organized so on the outside it's very
similar<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.990> many<00:00:16.440> other<00:00:16.560> cases<00:00:16.980> we've<00:00:17.250> looked

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
similar to many other cases we've looked

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.400 
similar to many other cases we've looked
at<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.210> somewhat<00:00:18.810> rigid

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
at it's got a somewhat rigid

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.019 
at it's got a somewhat rigid
construction<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> hard<00:00:20.850> case

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
construction so it's not a hard case

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.340 
construction so it's not a hard case
it's<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> soft<00:00:21.689> case<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> those

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's not a soft case it's one of those

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.290 
it's not a soft case it's one of those
in<00:00:22.890> between<00:00:23.460> cases<00:00:23.670> if<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> learn

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
different kinds of cases and the things

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.100 
different kinds of cases and the things
to<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:33.270> you're<00:00:33.420> buying<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.840> case

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
to think about when you're buying a case

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
to think about when you're buying a case
so<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.770> got<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.010> rigid<00:00:35.520> semi<00:00:35.790> rigid

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
so it's got this rigid semi rigid

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.700 
so it's got this rigid semi rigid
construction<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> then<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
construction and then it's got a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
construction and then it's got a
waterproof<00:00:38.399> zipper<00:00:38.879> around<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> outside

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
waterproof zipper around the outside

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
waterproof zipper around the outside
edge<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.290> say<00:00:40.590> waterproof<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.370> splash<00:00:41.640> proof

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
edge I say waterproof it's splash proof

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
edge I say waterproof it's splash proof
you<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.719> probably<00:00:42.870> pour<00:00:43.170> water<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you can probably pour water on this and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
you can probably pour water on this and
it<00:00:43.980> won't<00:00:44.160> affect<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> case<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> go

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it won't affect the case but if you go

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
it won't affect the case but if you go
and<00:00:46.110> dump<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.590> into<00:00:46.860> an<00:00:47.160> ocean<00:00:47.360> there's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and dump this into an ocean there's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.830 
and dump this into an ocean there's
going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.079> big<00:00:49.469> problem<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> once<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
going to be a big problem so once you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.439 
going to be a big problem so once you
open<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.199> zipper<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.250> open<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.120> case

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
open up that zipper we open up the case

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.380 
open up that zipper we open up the case
we<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> nice<00:00:55.590> foam<00:00:56.129> cutout<00:00:56.730> layout<00:00:57.090> inside

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
we get a nice foam cutout layout inside

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
we get a nice foam cutout layout inside
now<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> case<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.170> designed<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:59.160> GoPro

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
now this case is designed for one GoPro

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
now this case is designed for one GoPro
camera<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.050> got<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> cut<00:01:01.440> out

and<00:03:25.970> some<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.000> my<00:03:27.090> same<00:03:27.450> complaints<00:03:28.170> about

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
and some of my same complaints about

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.050 
and some of my same complaints about
that<00:03:28.530> case<00:03:28.830> hold<00:03:29.130> true<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that case hold true with this one and

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.750 
that case hold true with this one and
that's<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.330> fact<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:31.010> well<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.220> pocket<00:03:32.670> up

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
that's the fact that well this pocket up

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.060 
that's the fact that well this pocket up
the<00:03:32.880> top<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.330> great<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.500> thing<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.709> tends<00:03:34.980> to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
the top is great one thing that tends to

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.370 
the top is great one thing that tends to
happen<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.640> when<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> put<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.630> lot<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.930> stuff<00:03:37.230> in

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
happen is when you put a lot of stuff in

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.020 
happen is when you put a lot of stuff in
here<00:03:37.410> all<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.070> slides<00:03:38.400> down<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> bottom

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
here all of it slides down to the bottom

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.640 
here all of it slides down to the bottom
and<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> little<00:03:40.080> bit<00:03:40.170> hard<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.380> slip

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and then it's a little bit hard to slip

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.990 
and then it's a little bit hard to slip
your<00:03:40.769> case<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.489> went<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> lot

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
your case up because you went with a lot

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000 
your case up because you went with a lot
of<00:03:42.030> accessories<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.019> lower<00:03:43.320> patch<00:03:43.709> here

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
of accessories in this lower patch here

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.740 
of accessories in this lower patch here
and<00:03:44.519> none<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.820> top<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.330> kind<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.570> have

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and none of the top so you kind of have

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.050 
and none of the top so you kind of have
to<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.930> as<00:03:46.230> you're<00:03:46.769> closing<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.550> kind<00:03:48.000> of

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
to like as you're closing it you kind of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.640 
to like as you're closing it you kind of
try<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.269> shift<00:03:48.600> everything<00:03:48.870> up<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.230> top<00:03:49.410> to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
try to shift everything up to the top to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.470 
try to shift everything up to the top to
make<00:03:49.800> sure<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.100> closes<00:03:50.280> all<00:03:50.640> right<00:03:50.670> which

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
make sure it closes all right which

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.630 
make sure it closes all right which
doesn't<00:03:51.750> seem<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.050> be<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.560> deal<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.610> I

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
doesn't seem to be that I deal and I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.670 
doesn't seem to be that I deal and I
would<00:03:53.790> love<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.360> see<00:03:54.510> someone<00:03:54.750> put<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.410> little

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
would love to see someone put a little

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.560 
would love to see someone put a little
bit<00:03:55.860> more<00:03:55.980> engineering<00:03:56.370> into<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> kinds<00:03:57.480> of

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
bit more engineering into the kinds of

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.180 
bit more engineering into the kinds of
pockets<00:03:58.140> we<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.410> on<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.709> top<00:03:58.980> piece

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
pockets we have on this top piece

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.560 
pockets we have on this top piece
because<00:03:59.489> there<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> lot<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> space<00:04:00.330> up<00:04:00.540> here

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
because there is a lot of space up here

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.300 
because there is a lot of space up here
it<00:04:01.320> would<00:04:01.440> be<00:04:01.530> cool<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.769> see<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:02.010> little<00:04:02.220> bit

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
it would be cool to see a little bit

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.570 
it would be cool to see a little bit
more<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:03.560> organized<00:04:04.560> area<00:04:05.010> up<00:04:05.130> here<00:04:05.160> but<00:04:05.489> on

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
more of a organized area up here but on

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.830 
more of a organized area up here but on
the<00:04:05.610> flip<00:04:05.880> side<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.420> nice<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.630> have<00:04:06.780> that

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
the flip side it is nice to have that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.780 
the flip side it is nice to have that
big<00:04:07.050> pocket<00:04:07.440> we<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.739> put<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.190> little<00:04:08.519> bit<00:04:08.670> more

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
big pocket we can put a little bit more

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.790 
big pocket we can put a little bit more
flexibility<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.690> kinds<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.230> things<00:04:10.290> you

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
flexibility and the kinds of things you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.750 
flexibility and the kinds of things you
like<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.880> keep<00:04:12.060> up<00:04:12.330> here<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:14.310> case<00:04:14.580> doesn't

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
like to keep up here this case doesn't

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.449 
like to keep up here this case doesn't
have<00:04:15.120> quite<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.810> bad<00:04:16.290> as<00:04:16.530> at<00:04:16.650> POV<00:04:17.010> gear<00:04:17.220> case

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
have quite as bad as at POV gear case

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.699 
have quite as bad as at POV gear case
because<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.330> smaller<00:04:19.109> than<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.320> one<00:04:19.560> is

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
because it is smaller than that one is

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.590 
because it is smaller than that one is
to<00:04:19.890> be<00:04:20.070> larger<00:04:20.549> than<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.850> small<00:04:21.060> tree<00:04:21.210> case<00:04:21.450> we

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
to be larger than the small tree case we

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.230 
to be larger than the small tree case we
looked<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:23.100> was<00:04:23.400> large<00:04:23.789> in<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.970> small

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
looked at and I was large in the small

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.340 
looked at and I was large in the small
tree<00:04:24.450> case<00:04:24.720> but

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
tree case but

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.230 
tree case but
than<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.860> POV<00:04:26.280> gear<00:04:26.550> case<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:26.940> fits

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
than the POV gear case so it fits

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.120 
than the POV gear case so it fits
somewhere<00:04:27.480> in<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.930> middle<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.920> a

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
somewhere in the middle and it is a

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.980 
somewhere in the middle and it is a
pretty<00:04:29.460> nice<00:04:29.700> size<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.510> going<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.750> fit<00:04:30.960> in

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
pretty nice size this is going to fit in

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.840 
pretty nice size this is going to fit in
most<00:04:31.350> backpacks<00:04:32.010> without<00:04:32.340> too<00:04:32.520> much<00:04:32.640> trouble

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
most backpacks without too much trouble

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.760 
most backpacks without too much trouble
you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.660> take<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:33.930> with<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.380> on<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.740> go

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
you can take this with you on the go

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.090 
you can take this with you on the go
kind<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.580> like<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.880> name<00:04:36.060> implies<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:37.020> all<00:04:37.920> in
