too<00:01:23.460> much<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.939> basic<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> don't<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.259> we

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
too much here basic I don't like like we

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
had talked about i think though the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
had talked about i think though the
major<00:01:26.700> thing<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.299> tire<00:01:27.689> choice<00:01:28.130> these<00:01:29.130> are

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
major thing is tire choice these are

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.300 
major thing is tire choice these are
very<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> yeah<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> new<00:01:30.810> Conte<00:01:31.680> not

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
very like it yeah I new Conte not

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
very like it yeah I new Conte not
mountain<00:01:32.729> Kings<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.740> bit

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
mountain Kings so you know a little bit

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
mountain Kings so you know a little bit
open<00:01:35.280> tread<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.360> bit<00:01:36.479> lighter<00:01:36.689> tire

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
open tread a little bit lighter tire

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.160 
open tread a little bit lighter tire
they're<00:01:37.500> decent<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> don't<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:39.630> far

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
they're decent but I don't know how far

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.730 
they're decent but I don't know how far
you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.310> push<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you can really push them you know but I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.080 
you can really push them you know but I
don't<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.189> Whistler<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> summertime

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
don't think Whistler in the summertime

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.380 
don't think Whistler in the summertime
is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> place<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> take<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.390> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is a place to take them right but you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
is a place to take them right but you
know<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.920> majority<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
know I think for for the majority of the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.900 
blown away by how much the wheels took
off<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.930> know<00:02:54.989> we<00:02:55.290> had<00:02:55.380> talked<00:02:55.590> about<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:56.610> tried

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
off I know we had talked about we tried

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.610 
off I know we had talked about we tried
to<00:02:57.030> estimate<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.450> your<00:02:57.720> old<00:02:57.989> wheels<00:02:58.200> Wade

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you know but I think we were maybe a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.140 
you know but I think we were maybe a
little<00:03:01.140> bit<00:03:01.350> conservative<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.700> estimate

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
little bit conservative on that estimate

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.910 
little bit conservative on that estimate
plus<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.930> tires<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.380> had<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.620> there<00:03:04.769> we're

pretty heavy so yes it's great so the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100 
pretty heavy so yes it's great so the
overall<00:03:08.220> moral<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.090> basically<00:03:09.390> well<00:03:09.900> now

to<00:03:31.530> knock<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:32.070> bike<00:03:32.280> because<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:32.760> this

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
to knock this bike because I think this

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.520 
to knock this bike because I think this
is<00:03:33.239> one<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> best<00:03:33.720> suspension<00:03:34.200> systems

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
is one of the best suspension systems

the carbon yeah yeah so there's there's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840 
the carbon yeah yeah so there's there's
definitely<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.530> lot<00:03:53.040> out<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.579> can<00:03:53.700> be

be peddled all day so well this one this

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.900 
be peddled all day so well this one this
one<00:04:04.410> plays<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.829> role<00:04:04.980> very<00:04:05.220> well<00:04:05.280> though<00:04:05.609> and
