question but from Jason about tips on

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
question but from Jason about tips on
keeping<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.769> plane<00:00:23.010> straight<00:00:23.430> oops<00:00:24.420> which

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
keeping the plane straight oops which

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.870 
keeping the plane straight oops which
you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:25.769> always<00:00:25.920> easy<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you can see it's not always easy the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
you can see it's not always easy the
butterfly<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> back<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:29.010> brings<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.429> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
butterfly on the back which brings up a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.799 
butterfly on the back which brings up a
few<00:00:29.929> butterfly<00:00:30.929> behind<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> back<00:00:31.470> things

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
few butterfly behind the back things

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.709 
few butterfly behind the back things
first<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.930> don't<00:00:34.020> worry<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.649> easy

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
first one don't worry this is not easy

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.940 
first one don't worry this is not easy
butterfly<00:00:36.719> behind<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.200> will<00:00:37.469> take<00:00:37.739> some

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
butterfly behind the back will take some

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
butterfly behind the back will take some
messing<00:00:38.190> around<00:00:38.480> probably<00:00:39.480> maybe<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.840> will<00:00:39.930> be

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
messing around probably maybe it will be

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.430 
messing around probably maybe it will be
easy<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:41.840> know<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.079> everything

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
easy for you you know like everything

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
easy for you you know like everything
it's<00:00:43.860> always<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.930> break<00:00:46.110> stuff

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it's always good I think to break stuff

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.029 
it's always good I think to break stuff
down<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.550> step<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:48.440> is<00:00:49.440> learning<00:00:49.920> just

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
down a bit so step one is learning just

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.880 
down a bit so step one is learning just
to<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.370> poi<00:00:51.050> nice<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> smooth<00:00:52.530> behind

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
to have one poi nice and smooth behind

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670 
to have one poi nice and smooth behind
your<00:00:53.010> back<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:55.079> could<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.469> help

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
your back and that could really help

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
your back and that could really help
have<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.860> stood<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.340> close<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> wall

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
have you stood really close to a wall

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.930 
have you stood really close to a wall
and<00:00:57.620> practiced<00:00:58.620> having<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> behind<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.789> back

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and practiced having it behind your back

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
and practiced having it behind your back
if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> stand<00:01:00.390> straight<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> wall

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
if you stand straight with the wall

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.060 
if you stand straight with the wall
you'll<00:01:01.109> very<00:01:01.289> quickly<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.739> whether<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you'll very quickly know whether you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.820 
you'll very quickly know whether you
really<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> plane<00:01:02.850> straight<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> I'm

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
really got the plane straight so I'm

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.370 
really got the plane straight so I'm
going<00:01:04.890> inwards<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> sense<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going inwards and I just get a sense of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130 
going inwards and I just get a sense of
letting<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:07.740> hand<00:01:07.979> come<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.790> too<00:01:09.110> small<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
letting my hand come right too small of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.600 
letting my hand come right too small of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
relax that won't be if I'm tensing it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
relax that won't be if I'm tensing it's
going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> strain<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> shoulder<00:01:34.229> if

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
going to strain the shoulder if

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010 
going to strain the shoulder if
everything<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.369> totally<00:01:35.520> relaxed<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.900> just

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
everything is totally relaxed it's just

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.149 
everything is totally relaxed it's just
a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.200> motion<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> wrist<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.100> little

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
a little motion of the wrist a little

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
a little motion of the wrist a little
busy<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> bounce<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> think

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
busy it can just be a bounce but I think

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
busy it can just be a bounce but I think
yeah<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.189> better<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> wrist<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.240> really

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
yeah it's better if the wrist is really

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.469 
yeah it's better if the wrist is really
circling<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.939> relaxed

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
circling and it but it's a relaxed

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.340 
circling and it but it's a relaxed
circle<00:01:46.340> that's<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.460> commend<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.350> like

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
towards my back i can bring the bottom

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
towards my back i can bring the bottom
in<00:01:54.149> towards<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.750> my<00:01:55.290> calves<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.490> going

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
in towards my my calves but that's going

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.219 
in towards my my calves but that's going
to<00:01:56.759> take<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.390> some<00:01:57.570> playing<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.079> these

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to take really some playing like these

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
to take really some playing like these
funny<00:01:58.740> positions<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.430> around<00:01:59.670> behind<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
funny positions like around behind the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.999 
funny positions like around behind the
back<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.689> first<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.290> hand<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> feel

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
back at first your hand is going to feel

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
back at first your hand is going to feel
so<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.090> might<00:02:03.360> feel<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.899> awkward

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
so you know it might feel really awkward

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.340 
so you know it might feel really awkward
and<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.829> totally<00:02:05.250> normal<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.899> don't<00:02:07.140> worry

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and that's totally normal so don't worry

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.749 
and that's totally normal so don't worry
if<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.619> come<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.429> seems

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
if you come back here and it just seems

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.540 
if you come back here and it just seems
like<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.539> totally<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> control

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
like it's just totally out of control

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.890 
like it's just totally out of control
nothing's<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.879> wrong<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
nothing's going wrong it's just it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.760 
nothing's going wrong it's just it's
just

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
just
like<00:02:13.950> learning<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.760> new<00:02:14.790> cord<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> guitar

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
like learning a new cord in the guitar

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
like learning a new cord in the guitar
it<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.260> happen<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.710> one<00:02:16.740> day<00:02:16.890> for

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
it will just not happen in one day for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.940 
it will just not happen in one day for
most<00:02:17.310> people<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> wasn't<00:02:19.410> perfect<00:02:19.620> for<00:02:19.860> me

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
most people so it wasn't perfect for me

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.770 
most people so it wasn't perfect for me
at<00:02:20.070> first<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.670> kept<00:02:21.180> playing<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.570> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
at first I just kept playing with it and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.930 
at first I just kept playing with it and
eventually<00:02:22.080> get<00:02:22.530> more<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.920> more<00:02:22.950> normal<00:02:23.310> so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
eventually get more and more normal so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.640 
eventually get more and more normal so
step<00:02:24.120> number<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:24.810> holding<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.410> plane

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
step number one is just holding a plane

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.190 
step number one is just holding a plane
at<00:02:25.860> small<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.190> your<00:02:26.250> back<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.630> relaxing

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
at small of your back and just relaxing

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.110 
at small of your back and just relaxing

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
relaxing don't stay just a little bit at

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.940 
relaxing don't stay just a little bit at
a<00:02:30.180> time<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:31.020> will<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.320> feeling<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.710> a

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
a time and you will get a feeling for a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.880 
a time and you will get a feeling for a
plane<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.580> small<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.940> your<00:02:32.970> back<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:34.410> then

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
plane at small of your back and then

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.230 
plane at small of your back and then
you'll<00:02:35.040> learn<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.400> adjust<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.940> plane<00:02:36.120> too

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
you'll learn to adjust the plane too

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.400 
you'll learn to adjust the plane too
small<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.570> back<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.260> might

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
small of your back but really that might

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
small of your back but really that might
take<00:02:37.530> weeks<00:02:37.800> right<00:02:38.760> no<00:02:39.000> don't<00:02:39.300> don't<00:02:39.870> think

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
take weeks right no don't don't think

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.510 
take weeks right no don't don't think
don't<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.560> frustrated<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:41.130> doesn't<00:02:41.340> seem<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
don't be frustrated it doesn't seem to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.190 
don't be frustrated it doesn't seem to
happen<00:02:41.610> right<00:02:41.850> away<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.110> like

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
happen right away so really it's like

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 
happen right away so really it's like
playing<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.640> piano<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.030> guitar

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
playing the you know the piano or guitar

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.570 
playing the you know the piano or guitar
or<00:02:45.660> something<00:02:45.780> where<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.280> some

or something where you just have to some
steps<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.970> takes<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.240> while<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> when<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> right

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
steps it takes a while so when the right

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.940 
steps it takes a while so when the right
can<00:02:50.400> go<00:02:50.490> behind<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.210> hold<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.450> plan<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
can go behind and hold the plan and the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.670 
can go behind and hold the plan and the
left<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.430> behind<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.090> hold<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.390> plane

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
left can go behind and hold the plane

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040 
left can go behind and hold the plane
then<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.830> can<00:02:55.950> start<00:02:56.070> doing<00:02:56.340> stuff<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.580> this

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
then you can start doing stuff like this

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.140 
then you can start doing stuff like this
the<00:02:58.050> left<00:02:58.260> goes<00:02:58.440> behind<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.100> they're<00:02:59.910> right

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the left goes behind and they're right

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.940 
the left goes behind and they're right
you<00:03:00.480> might<00:03:00.630> try<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> flip<00:03:01.080> pine<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.590> come<00:03:01.800> out

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you might try to flip pine and come out

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.580 
you might try to flip pine and come out

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
just think about what it would mean to

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.120 
just think about what it would mean to
switch<00:04:49.860> which<00:04:50.730> boys<00:04:51.000> on<00:04:51.150> top<00:04:51.390> which<00:04:51.980> for<00:04:52.980> me

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
switch which boys on top which for me

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.580 
switch which boys on top which for me
boy<00:04:53.460> like<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.940> do<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.180> consistently<00:04:54.330> oh<00:04:54.900> I

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
boy like to do that consistently oh I

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.500 
boy like to do that consistently oh I
took<00:04:55.740> practice<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.760> was<00:04:56.880> not<00:04:57.030> easy<00:04:57.240> I

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
took practice that was not easy I

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.510 
took practice that was not easy I
remember<00:04:58.320> those<00:04:58.440> days<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.860> can<00:04:58.980> do<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.100> few<00:04:59.370> and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
remember those days I can do a few and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520 
remember those days I can do a few and
then<00:04:59.610> they'd<00:04:59.700> always<00:04:59.940> tingle<00:05:00.510> so<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.350> really

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
then they'd always tingle so it really

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.070 
then they'd always tingle so it really
took<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.770> while<00:05:03.590> but<00:05:05.120> yeah<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.510> mean<00:05:06.870> it's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
took a while but yeah so I mean it's

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.220 
took a while but yeah so I mean it's

back will take time and you'll just get

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.880 
back will take time and you'll just get
there<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.670> it's<00:05:15.660> all<00:05:15.840> about<00:05:16.080> one<00:05:16.620> arm<00:05:16.740> at<00:05:16.830> a

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
there and it's all about one arm at a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.510 
there and it's all about one arm at a
time<00:05:16.920> learning<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.790> adjust<00:05:17.850> your<00:05:18.150> planes

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
time learning to adjust your planes

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.160 
time learning to adjust your planes
making<00:05:20.520> sure<00:05:20.820> you're<00:05:21.030> really<00:05:21.420> relaxed<00:05:22.050> so

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
making sure you're really relaxed so

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.210 
making sure you're really relaxed so
you're<00:05:22.290> not<00:05:22.380> straining<00:05:22.710> your<00:05:22.920> shoulder

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
you're not straining your shoulder

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.440 
you're not straining your shoulder
because<00:05:23.370> it's<00:05:23.580> kind<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.030> bit<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.300> reach

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
because it's kind of a bit of a reach

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.110 
because it's kind of a bit of a reach
get<00:05:24.690> around<00:05:24.900> there<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:26.250> then<00:05:26.370> slowly<00:05:26.760> as<00:05:27.090> you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
get around there and then slowly as you

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.610 
get around there and then slowly as you
get<00:05:27.300> those<00:05:27.420> plans<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.080> everything<00:05:28.140> loosens

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
get those plans and everything loosens

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.140 
get those plans and everything loosens
up<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:29.040> you're<00:05:29.130> gently<00:05:29.400> circling<00:05:29.880> your<00:05:29.940> wrist

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
up and you're gently circling your wrist

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.940 
up and you're gently circling your wrist
and<00:05:30.360> everything's<00:05:30.660> comfortable<00:05:30.950> you'll

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
and everything's comfortable you'll

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.470 
and everything's comfortable you'll
start<00:05:32.130> having<00:05:32.310> a<00:05:32.370> lot<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:32.580> control<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.150> pasta

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
start having a lot of control the pasta

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.450 
start having a lot of control the pasta
play<00:05:33.630> around<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.740> that's<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.220> all<00:05:35.280> these

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
play around and that's and all these

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.860 
play around and that's and all these
from<00:05:35.669> start<00:05:35.910> looking<00:05:36.180> really<00:05:36.390> nicely<00:05:36.600> when

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
from start looking really nicely when

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.170 
from start looking really nicely when
the<00:05:36.960> planes<00:05:37.260> are<00:05:37.560> straight<00:05:37.800> cuz<00:05:38.700> then<00:05:38.940> you've

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
the planes are straight cuz then you've

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.050 
the planes are straight cuz then you've
really<00:05:39.360> got<00:05:39.480> geometry<00:05:40.110> in<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.290> spinning<00:05:44.060> so

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
really got geometry in the spinning so

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.200 
really got geometry in the spinning so
you'll<00:05:45.210> get<00:05:45.330> there<00:05:45.480> good<00:05:45.870> question
