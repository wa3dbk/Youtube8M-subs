you've never seen any before the variety
that<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.710> growing<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> be<00:00:11.820> black

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
that we're growing is going to be black

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.320 
that we're growing is going to be black
Watchmen<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:14.130> actually<00:00:14.460> sell<00:00:14.700> these<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.969> eBay

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
Watchmen we actually sell these on eBay

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200 
Watchmen we actually sell these on eBay
and<00:00:15.949> we<00:00:16.949> love<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.310> black<00:00:17.520> ones<00:00:17.850> they're<00:00:18.029> just

and we love the black ones they're just

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210 
and we love the black ones they're just
they<00:00:18.390> stick<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.810> they're<00:00:19.199> really<00:00:19.619> cool<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they stick out they're really cool and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.769 
they stick out they're really cool and
they're<00:00:20.580> easy<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.029> grow<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> method<00:00:24.660> we're

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
they're easy to grow the method we're

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.429 
they're easy to grow the method we're
going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.109> today<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.160> perlite<00:00:26.580> method

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
going to use today is the perlite method

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.220 
going to use today is the perlite method
okay<00:00:28.439> I've<00:00:28.680> already<00:00:28.740> got<00:00:29.039> seeds<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
okay I've already got seeds in there and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.659 
okay I've already got seeds in there and
the<00:00:31.230> perlite<00:00:31.590> settled<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.099> there<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.640> just

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the perlite settled in there so we just

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.069 
the perlite settled in there so we just
use<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.440> regular<00:00:34.649> perlite<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.079> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
use a you know regular perlite and the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.380 
use a you know regular perlite and the
solution<00:00:37.530> we'd<00:00:37.680> use<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> perlite<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
solution we'd use to what the perlite is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
solution we'd use to what the perlite is
just<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> bottle<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> water<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> cap<00:00:41.460> full

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
just a bottle of water with a cap full

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.510 
just a bottle of water with a cap full
of<00:00:41.760> hydrogen<00:00:42.300> peroxide<00:00:43.280> okay

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
of hydrogen peroxide okay

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.600 
of hydrogen peroxide okay
any<00:00:45.180> hydrogen<00:00:45.719> peroxide<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
any hydrogen peroxide you can go to the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.240 
any hydrogen peroxide you can go to the
store<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.270> pick<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.739> any<00:00:49.739> name-brand

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
more perlite to the bag that's better I

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.730 
more perlite to the bag that's better I
don't<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.840> need<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> add<00:01:34.140> more<00:01:34.170> perlite

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
don't think we need to add more perlite

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.140 
don't think we need to add more perlite
all<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.420> seal<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> bag<00:01:37.259> and

hollyhocks props very quick it doesn't

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.319 
hollyhocks props very quick it doesn't
need<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> whole<00:01:42.360> lot<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> anything<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.619> grow<00:01:44.329> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
need a whole lot of anything to grow you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.899 
need a whole lot of anything to grow you
can<00:01:45.479> keep<00:01:45.630> temperatures<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.439> 60<00:01:46.920> 65<00:01:47.520> degrees

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
can keep temperatures at 60 65 degrees

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.410 
can keep temperatures at 60 65 degrees
for<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.210> hollyhock<00:01:48.600> seeds<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:51.270> know

these<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> grow<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.270> pretty

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
these are going to grow these are pretty

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
these are going to grow these are pretty
pretty<00:02:01.530> easy<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> grow<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.229> say<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.500> a

pretty easy to grow and I would say in a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.959 
pretty easy to grow and I would say in a
few<00:02:04.619> days<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.280> gonna<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.520> some<00:02:05.640> sprouts

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
few days we're gonna have some sprouts

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.190
