00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.040
 begin friends my name is giancarlo 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 today I'm going to draw 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 is that the barcelona is the most 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.140
 great of the world then good I hope 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.510
 like it 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.790
 first thing I'm going to start drawing the 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.390
 top part of the shield more or less 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.390
 thus 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.300
 let's draw three waves in this way 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 more or less 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.929
 over here 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 in a few days 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.370
 let's highlight 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.370
 now let's go down this side 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.960
 this curve we are going to lower the line by 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.090
 this side 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 and we are going to make a curved line here 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.260
 that's it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.260
 and here we are going to make a picks 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.330
 the same here 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.360
 let's do this curved line and then 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.360
 let's go down this side 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.510
 and we go to the curve 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 with a little 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.950
 and well here we already have practically the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.190
 part of the outside shield I'll catch 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.170
 another thinner marker to give you a 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.960
 little more of life to the drawing 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.500
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.200
 draw here a straight line 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.720
 in this way more or less than through 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.690
 of the bullet or let's go up 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.950
 following this curve that we are going to have 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.950
 how do you know space ready 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.200
 more or less and we're going to do the same 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.210
 curves will take the tips below 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.080
 going up is there 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.460
 and we close 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.250
 already after we're going to like to have 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.179
 and this in half 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 notice then be careful in the middle east 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.530
 shield in this part has a crispy 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.210
 let's divide this into four squares 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.390
 here to see the first picture 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.440
 here the second here then we're going to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.440
 draw this third 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 and now we have the cross 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.980
 from the barça school I think the cross of 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.310
 san jorge you will correct me 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.720
 then here we are going to draw a line 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.269
 well we do not have to have done 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.819
 is how to draw here this line that 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.250
 gerais 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.900
 now it's not a little 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.329
 here 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.040
 and well let's go making lines is 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.640
 completed 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.190
 is the shield pretty much has that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.220
 number of lines 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.360
 then we are going to draw a straight line 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.360
 in the bottom 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.370
 more or less from this point to this 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.590
 point 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.319
 more or less 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.769
 then afterwards we are going to make a 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:18.150
 line curve by the bottom up 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.150
 unite with the other 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.620
 well there was the barça here has a 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.620
 ball then let's make a circle 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.290
 in this way here in all the half of 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.319
 this center ready this ball is 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.150
 pretty old 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.569
 then it is a ball like patches 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.329
 like from the slightly round patches 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.340
 well then here we finished this 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.220
 shape we will make like three 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.460
 hearts more or less 103 hearts and 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.540
 then here we are going to close 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.540
 thus 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.620
 and here we are going to download a line 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.219
 thus 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.540
 and we are going to start living and here they have 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.879
 to get us three parties 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.920
 how is a two and three and the same 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.650
 we will do in the other part has to 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.440
 get out 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.190
 in these three parts 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.890
 good and what we have left is like the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.980
 as the name of the club and then it would be 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:32.420
 the FC Barcelona 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.420
 then we will make the initials 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.559
 what is a badge of this club 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.770
 dfc and the time 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.770
 - the MEWA who walks with a little big 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.760
 but more or less that's how it is 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.250
 I'm going to paint it, I'll start with the efe for 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.230
 suddenly do not drag the ink and 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.780
 soon add our drawing always 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.540
 let's keep that in mind let's go 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.080
 left to right with that with that no 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.770
 we drag the ink of our ours 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.790
 marker because if you do it in pencil 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.590
 You also have to start from 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:17.640
 left to right if no yes no 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.640
 will drag the good graphite 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.940
 so 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.860
 that we are ending already with the time 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.560
 but they liked him is that the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.380
 barcelona personally I'm not the 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.690
 barça but but I think it 's a 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.580
 pretty beautiful shield then I hope 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.650
