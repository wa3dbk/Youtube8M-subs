this is gonna be a secret base guide to
making<00:00:03.360> an<00:00:03.510> electric-type<00:00:04.259> themed<00:00:04.830> gym<00:00:05.220> now<00:00:05.850> I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
making an electric-type themed gym now I

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.309 
making an electric-type themed gym now I
was<00:00:06.270> trying<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> think<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.810> some<00:00:07.109> really

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
was trying to think about some really

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.200 
was trying to think about some really
good<00:00:07.440> locations<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.030> stood

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
good locations and the one that stood

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.030 
good locations and the one that stood
out<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.480> most<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:09.809> if<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.080> fly<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> route<00:00:10.530> 110

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
out the most was if you fly to route 110

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.280 
out the most was if you fly to route 110
and<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.639> go<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.090> tree<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.809> near<00:00:13.080> new

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and they go to this tree it's near new

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
and they go to this tree it's near new
Marvel<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.070> Marvel<00:00:14.490> since<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.030> like<00:00:15.120> The

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
Marvel and Marvel since it's like The

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.180 
Marvel and Marvel since it's like The
Electric<00:00:15.509> City<00:00:15.780> that's<00:00:16.020> kind<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> best<00:00:16.949> I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
Electric City that's kind of the best I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.220 
Electric City that's kind of the best I
was<00:00:17.340> able<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> come<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.779> there<00:00:19.080> are<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
was able to come up with so there are a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.900 
was able to come up with so there are a
couple<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> other<00:00:19.710> areas<00:00:19.949> also<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.520> area<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
couple of other areas also this area is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.460 
couple of other areas also this area is
taken<00:00:21.300> by<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> secret<00:00:21.810> path<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> don't<00:00:22.350> want

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
taken by a secret path so I don't want

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.200 
taken by a secret path so I don't want
to<00:00:22.529> remove<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.609> find<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.939> layout

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to remove it but if you find a layout

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
to remove it but if you find a layout
I'm<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.140> find<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.439> layout<00:00:25.680> similar<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
I'm gonna find a layout similar to this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.980 
I'm gonna find a layout similar to this
and<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:26.670> decorate<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> could<00:00:27.810> use

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and then decorate it but you could use

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
and then decorate it but you could use
this<00:00:28.019> location<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.039> isn't<00:00:29.310> occupied<00:00:29.519> or

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this location if it isn't occupied or

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.089 
this location if it isn't occupied or
you<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.140> location<00:00:31.560> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you just really want this location so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
you just really want this location so
we'll<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:33.110> alright<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
we'll get into that first alright so I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.260 
we'll get into that first alright so I
ended<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.620> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> route<00:00:35.280> 114<00:00:36.059> where

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
ended up going to route 114 where

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
ended up going to route 114 where
there's<00:00:36.420> also<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.750> tree<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.290> island<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
there's also a tree on an island and it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
there's also a tree on an island and it
has<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> same<00:00:38.399> layout<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.239> let's<00:00:39.540> go<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.989> do

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
has the same layout so let's go and do

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.389 
has the same layout so let's go and do
what<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.739> look<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
what we do and look at all the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
what we do and look at all the
decorations<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.600> for

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
decorations that we can use for

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500 
decorations that we can use for
electric-types<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.219> looking<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> desk

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
electric-types now looking at the desk

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
electric-types now looking at the desk
we<00:00:45.780> don't<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.110> many<00:00:46.530> desk<00:00:46.920> options<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> guess

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
we don't have many desk options I guess

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
we don't have many desk options I guess
like<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> pokeball<00:00:48.360> desk<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.020> kind<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
like the pokeball desk it's kind of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
like the pokeball desk it's kind of
going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.920> go-to<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> situation

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
going to be your go-to in a situation

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.520 
going to be your go-to in a situation
like<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.079> means<00:00:52.230> we're<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.440> gonna

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
like this and that means we're not gonna

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439 
like this and that means we're not gonna
have<00:00:52.710> any<00:00:52.739> chairs<00:00:53.219> however<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> mats<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.300> do

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
have any chairs however in mats we do

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
have any chairs however in mats we do
get<00:00:54.719> our<00:00:54.870> Thunder<00:00:55.289> mat<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> Thunder<00:00:56.309> mat

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
get our Thunder mat so the Thunder mat

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.080 
get our Thunder mat so the Thunder mat
is<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.559> electric<00:00:58.559> feeling<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> stuff<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is really electric feeling and stuff I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.939 
is really electric feeling and stuff I
bought<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> ton<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> them<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.530> unlike

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
bought a ton of them because we unlike

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
bought a ton of them because we unlike
the<00:01:02.100> elemental<00:01:02.730> types<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.449> don't

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the elemental types as well we don't

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870 
the elemental types as well we don't
really<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.650> Piplup<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> Charmander<00:01:05.850> or

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
really have the Piplup the Charmander or

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
really have the Piplup the Charmander or
anything<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.869> work<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.590> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
anything like that to work with so it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.960 
anything like that to work with so it's
pretty<00:01:07.799> much<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.790> these

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
pretty much it's going to be like these

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
pretty much it's going to be like these
electric<00:01:09.450> type<00:01:09.600> mats<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.110> bought<00:01:10.260> five

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
electric type mats I think I bought five

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
electric type mats I think I bought five
of<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.460> you're<00:01:11.520> gonna<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
of them so you're gonna have to really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
of them so you're gonna have to really
use<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> try<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> spice<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.490> I'm

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
use them to try to spice up actually I'm

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.249 
use them to try to spice up actually I'm
gonna<00:01:14.700> find<00:01:14.909> six<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.240> guess<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> use

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
gonna find six I guess you have to use

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
gonna find six I guess you have to use
it<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> try<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> spice<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> area<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.700> much

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it to try to spice up the area as much

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
it to try to spice up the area as much
as<00:01:18.060> possible<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:19.580> necessarily<00:01:20.580> by<00:01:20.880> mean

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
as possible and not necessarily by mean

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.130 
as possible and not necessarily by mean
like<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.689> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.049> those

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
like it's it's kind of one of those

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.580 
like it's it's kind of one of those
things<00:01:22.320> where<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.369> kind<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> help<00:01:24.600> bring

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
things where it will kind of help bring

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.109 
things where it will kind of help bring
the<00:01:25.740> theme<00:01:25.920> together<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.000> really

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the theme together because it's really

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.030 
the theme together because it's really
all<00:01:27.240> you've<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.380> except<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
all you've got so I mean it's except it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it's exciting it has electric feel to it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.010 
it's exciting it has electric feel to it
it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.650> Thunder<00:01:31.890> mat<00:01:32.070> can't<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.820> wrong<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.689> we

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it's a Thunder mat can't go wrong so we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's a Thunder mat can't go wrong so we
just<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
just kind of have that and as you can

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
see you know with all the other mats we

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.390 
see you know with all the other mats we
don't<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.350> anything<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.159> brings

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
don't have anything that kind of brings

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
don't have anything that kind of brings
it<00:01:38.820> together<00:01:39.030> stunfisk<00:01:39.990> well<00:01:40.200> technically

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
it together stunfisk well technically

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.830 
it together stunfisk well technically
having<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> electricity<00:01:41.729> doesn't<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
having that electricity doesn't it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
having that electricity doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.500> work<00:01:43.799> too<00:01:43.860> well<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.670> more

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
doesn't really work too well that's more

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.760 
doesn't really work too well that's more
of<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> ground<00:01:45.210> type<00:01:45.479> thing<00:01:45.689> same<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.409> plants

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
of a ground type thing same for plants

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
of a ground type thing same for plants
and<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> our<00:01:47.700> objects<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.450> have

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and if we go to our objects we do have

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.999 
and if we go to our objects we do have
yellow<00:01:48.810> bricks<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> mean<00:01:49.619> yellow<00:01:49.770> bricks

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
yellow bricks so I mean yellow bricks

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
yellow bricks so I mean yellow bricks
are<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> give<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> color<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.869> yellow

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
are going to give it color that yellow

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
are going to give it color that yellow
feel<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.189> tree<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.000> works

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
feel and I think the tree kind of works

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
feel and I think the tree kind of works
since<00:01:54.869> Brown<00:01:55.049> has<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
since Brown has a little bit of that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
since Brown has a little bit of that
yellow<00:01:56.369> feel<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> make

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
yellow feel to it you can kind of make

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.830 
yellow feel to it you can kind of make
it<00:01:58.710> work<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> then<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.579> also<00:01:59.700> go<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it work and then we can also go with the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.240 
it work and then we can also go with the
others<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.740> things<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.979> we're<00:02:02.159> looking

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
others kind of things that we're looking

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
others kind of things that we're looking
at<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.390> least<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.840> start

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
at like here at least we can start

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.030 
at like here at least we can start
getting<00:02:04.259> away<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.560> some<00:02:04.860> really

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
getting away with some really

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.850 
getting away with some really
interesting<00:02:05.130> things<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:06.509> if<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.469> down

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
interesting things because if we go down

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.449 
interesting things because if we go down
to<00:02:09.050> something<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> globe<00:02:10.679> globe<00:02:11.280> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to something like the globe globe it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.670 
to something like the globe globe it's
like<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.760> runs<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.569> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
like it runs on like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.230 
like it runs on like
technically<00:02:14.130> something<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:14.880> can<00:02:15.030> move<00:02:15.209> a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
technically something we can move a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.180 
technically something we can move a
globe<00:02:15.569> around<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.260> stuff<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.040> also

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
globe around and stuff and then we also

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.620 
globe around and stuff and then we also
have<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> couple<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.760> other<00:02:17.880> objects<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.480> can

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
have a couple of other objects that can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.620 
have a couple of other objects that can
work<00:02:19.319> out<00:02:19.590> pretty<00:02:19.980> well<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.940> um<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.540> like

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
work out pretty well like um I do like

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.530 
work out pretty well like um I do like
the<00:02:22.140> idea<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.440> like<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> mini<00:02:22.890> lumiose<00:02:23.540> because

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the idea of like a mini lumiose because

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.240 
the idea of like a mini lumiose because
that's<00:02:24.810> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.170> make<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> where<00:02:25.739> you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's going to make it to where you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.920 
that's going to make it to where you
can't<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.849> lumiose<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.480> an<00:02:27.599> electric

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
can't like it lumiose is an electric

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.540 
can't like it lumiose is an electric
city<00:02:28.170> as<00:02:28.290> well<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.069> kind<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.310> put<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
city as well so you can kind of put the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.970 
city as well so you can kind of put the
lumiose<00:02:29.850> tower<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.080> might<00:02:31.350> work

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
lumiose tower in there and it might work

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.840 
lumiose tower in there and it might work
out<00:02:32.100> pretty<00:02:32.340> well

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
out pretty well

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.710 
out pretty well
Starlite<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.770> chandelier<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
Starlite it's it's a chandelier and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.600 
Starlite it's it's a chandelier and
that's<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.430> on

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that's kind of it for what we have on

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
that's kind of it for what we have on
the<00:02:38.700> objects<00:02:39.150> wall<00:02:39.540> are<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.110> least<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.350> get

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470

because it's really vibrant and it works

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.030 
because it's really vibrant and it works
out<00:04:28.900> now<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> corner<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.740> eye<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.919> first

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
out now the corner of the eye the first

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.680 
out now the corner of the eye the first
thing<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.729> see<00:04:30.940> is<00:04:31.150> going<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.449> be<00:04:31.509> that

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
thing that you see is going to be that

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.450 
thing that you see is going to be that
Pikachu<00:04:31.960> poster<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.620> degree<00:04:32.889> you<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.400> a

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
Pikachu poster to a degree you have a

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.120 
Pikachu poster to a degree you have a
lot<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.669> this<00:04:33.940> running<00:04:34.389> around<00:04:34.509> with<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
lot of this running around with the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.770 
lot of this running around with the
electric<00:04:36.130> pads<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.610> still<00:04:37.120> think<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.419> the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
electric pads I still think that the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.050 
electric pads I still think that the
lumiose<00:04:38.650> city<00:04:38.740> works<00:04:39.250> out<00:04:39.430> really<00:04:39.550> well<00:04:39.669> and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
lumiose city works out really well and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.580 
lumiose city works out really well and
for<00:04:40.419> some<00:04:40.600> reason<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.960> hard<00:04:41.139> chair<00:04:41.380> right

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
for some reason the hard chair right

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.050 
for some reason the hard chair right
here<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:42.190> works<00:04:42.370> out<00:04:42.550> because<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.759> mean<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.970> was

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
here it works out because I mean I was

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.580 
here it works out because I mean I was
thinking<00:04:43.360> what<00:04:43.840> if<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.020> have<00:04:44.199> this<00:04:44.320> kind<00:04:44.470> of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
thinking what if you have this kind of

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.890 
thinking what if you have this kind of
like<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.770> mini<00:04:44.979> coffee<00:04:45.340> table<00:04:45.850> or<00:04:46.000> display

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
like a mini coffee table or display

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.659 
like a mini coffee table or display
piece<00:04:47.139> that<00:04:47.350> people<00:04:47.590> sit<00:04:47.800> around<00:04:47.889> so<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.550> can

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
piece that people sit around so you can

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.189 
piece that people sit around so you can
kind<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.880> sit<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.330> look<00:04:49.539> at<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.050> works

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
kind of sit and look at it and it works

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:50.610 
kind of sit and look at it and it works

like<00:05:49.659> kind<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:49.960> up<00:05:50.050> in<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.229> forest<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:50.770> feels

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
like kind of up in the forest it feels

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.800 
like kind of up in the forest it feels
like<00:05:51.220> it<00:05:51.639> can<00:05:51.820> work<00:05:51.970> out<00:05:52.150> so<00:05:52.389> we'll<00:05:52.539> build<00:05:52.750> a

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
like it can work out so we'll build a

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.420 
like it can work out so we'll build a
secret<00:05:52.960> base<00:05:53.199> here<00:05:53.380> well<00:05:53.860> build<00:05:54.070> this<00:05:54.220> one

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
secret base here well build this one

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.740 
secret base here well build this one
then<00:05:54.610> we'll<00:05:54.699> go<00:05:54.820> back<00:05:54.849> to<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.210> other<00:05:55.360> layout

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
then we'll go back to the other layout

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.750 
then we'll go back to the other layout
and<00:05:55.990> hopefully<00:05:56.680> those<00:05:56.889> three<00:05:57.130> designs<00:05:57.430> will

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
and hopefully those three designs will

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.399 
and hopefully those three designs will
really<00:05:58.060> work<00:05:58.210> out<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:58.690> think<00:05:59.020> I<00:05:59.080> came<00:05:59.229> up<00:05:59.380> with

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
really work out I think I came up with

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.020 
really work out I think I came up with
some<00:05:59.620> of<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.740> better<00:05:59.889> location<00:06:00.490> areas<00:06:00.789> and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
some of the better location areas and

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.180 
some of the better location areas and
let's<00:06:01.630> get<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.110> with<00:06:02.409> this<00:06:02.650> secret<00:06:02.979> base

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
let's get to it with this secret base

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.279 
let's get to it with this secret base
alright<00:06:04.030> so<00:06:04.270> I<00:06:04.330> tried<00:06:04.599> to<00:06:04.630> make<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.990> most<00:06:05.169> of

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
have to go through that several times

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.089 
have to go through that several times
you<00:06:23.139> can<00:06:23.260> just<00:06:23.440> kind<00:06:23.590> of<00:06:23.620> go<00:06:23.770> through<00:06:23.949> there

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
you can just kind of go through there

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.040 
you can just kind of go through there
sure<00:06:24.520> not<00:06:24.699> to<00:06:24.789> be<00:06:24.909> too<00:06:25.090> much<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.419> a<00:06:25.479> troll<00:06:25.750> and

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
sure not to be too much of a troll and

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.510 
sure not to be too much of a troll and
then<00:06:26.320> if<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.530> try<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.740> get<00:06:26.919> out<00:06:27.010> you<00:06:27.130> know<00:06:27.159> just

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
then if you try to get out you know just

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.700 
then if you try to get out you know just
yell<00:06:28.000> a<00:06:28.030> little<00:06:28.240> tile<00:06:28.539> here<00:06:28.840> I'm<00:06:29.380> gonna<00:06:29.590> be

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
yell a little tile here I'm gonna be

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.200 
yell a little tile here I'm gonna be
standing<00:06:30.039> here<00:06:30.099> and<00:06:30.460> I<00:06:30.490> think<00:06:30.550> that<00:06:30.699> this<00:06:30.970> is

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
standing here and I think that this is

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.390 
standing here and I think that this is
really<00:06:31.770> exciting<00:06:32.770> that<00:06:32.800> you<00:06:33.010> have<00:06:33.159> all<00:06:33.280> the

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
really exciting that you have all the

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.580 
really exciting that you have all the
Pikachu's<00:06:33.820> around<00:06:34.210> and<00:06:34.479> stuff<00:06:34.750> and<00:06:35.020> it<00:06:35.440> looks

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
Pikachu's around and stuff and it looks

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.230 
Pikachu's around and stuff and it looks
really<00:06:35.770> good<00:06:35.860> with<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.099> poster<00:06:36.490> we<00:06:36.940> kept<00:06:37.120> the

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
really good with the poster we kept the

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.779 
really good with the poster we kept the
theme<00:06:37.389> here<00:06:37.599> with<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.990> mini<00:06:38.770> Castelli<00:06:39.219> or<00:06:39.490> the

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
theme here with the mini Castelli or the

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:40.110 
theme here with the mini Castelli or the
mini

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
mini

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.909 
mini
and<00:06:40.660> I<00:06:40.870> think<00:06:40.960> it<00:06:41.139> just<00:06:41.229> works<00:06:41.470> out<00:06:41.620> like<00:06:41.800> the

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
and I think it just works out like the

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.460 
and I think it just works out like the
trainers<00:06:42.250> are<00:06:42.400> about<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:43.570> that's<00:06:43.690> do<00:06:44.229> a<00:06:44.260> good

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
trainers are about and that's do a good

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.080 
trainers are about and that's do a good
job<00:06:44.680> and<00:06:44.949> then<00:06:45.130> you<00:06:45.280> can<00:06:45.430> just<00:06:45.550> kind<00:06:45.669> of<00:06:45.760> go<00:06:45.910> up

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
job and then you can just kind of go up

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.150 
job and then you can just kind of go up
grab<00:06:46.360> the<00:06:46.510> flag<00:06:46.720> check<00:06:47.380> out<00:06:47.500> some<00:06:47.680> stuff<00:06:47.919> and

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
grab the flag check out some stuff and

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.310 
grab the flag check out some stuff and
then<00:06:48.340> leave<00:06:48.669> without<00:06:49.449> too<00:06:49.780> much<00:06:49.930> of<00:06:49.990> a<00:06:50.139> hassle

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
then leave without too much of a hassle

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.560 
then leave without too much of a hassle
so<00:06:50.710> this<00:06:50.979> is<00:06:51.130> just<00:06:51.310> like<00:06:51.520> one<00:06:51.760> little<00:06:51.880> more<00:06:52.479> of

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
so this is just like one little more of

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.810 
so this is just like one little more of
a<00:06:52.630> fun<00:06:52.870> idea<00:06:52.900> and<00:06:53.470> then<00:06:53.889> we<00:06:54.010> can<00:06:54.160> go<00:06:54.340> to<00:06:54.400> the

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
a fun idea and then we can go to the

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.560 
a fun idea and then we can go to the
last<00:06:55.090> idea<00:06:55.449> I<00:06:55.510> was<00:06:55.690> thinking<00:06:56.020> about<00:06:56.080> Iike<00:06:56.949> spam

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
last idea I was thinking about Iike spam

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.909 
last idea I was thinking about Iike spam
so<00:06:58.570> we<00:06:58.690> go<00:06:58.780> up<00:06:58.900> here<00:06:58.960> boom

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
so we go up here boom

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.740 
so we go up here boom
Pikachu's<00:07:00.580> everywhere<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.150> second<00:07:01.570> room

Pikachu's everywhere the second room

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
really cozy feeling I have the just the

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.570 
really cozy feeling I have the just the
TV<00:07:04.360> set<00:07:04.630> up<00:07:04.780> I<00:07:04.900> got<00:07:05.050> a<00:07:05.080> light<00:07:05.350> and<00:07:05.650> then<00:07:06.070> some<00:07:06.430> of

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
TV set up I got a light and then some of

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.189 
TV set up I got a light and then some of
Pikachu<00:07:06.940> dolls<00:07:07.150> and<00:07:07.449> a<00:07:07.570> couple<00:07:07.720> of<00:07:07.840> trainers

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.810 
Pikachu dolls and a couple of trainers
and<00:07:08.620> I<00:07:08.710> think<00:07:08.949> that<00:07:09.070> this<00:07:09.220> actually<00:07:09.400> it<00:07:09.669> looks

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
and I think that this actually it looks

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.040 
and I think that this actually it looks
really<00:07:10.060> nice<00:07:10.150> like<00:07:10.330> if<00:07:10.419> you<00:07:10.479> just<00:07:10.600> take<00:07:10.810> this

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
really nice like if you just take this

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
and then I think it's nice having like

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.200 
and then I think it's nice having like
the<00:07:23.229> music<00:07:23.770> panel<00:07:24.070> in<00:07:24.340> front<00:07:24.580> of<00:07:24.669> jukebox<00:07:25.030> of

the music panel in front of jukebox of

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.020 
the music panel in front of jukebox of
the<00:07:25.270> Pikachu<00:07:25.690> and<00:07:26.139> I<00:07:26.710> think<00:07:27.250> this<00:07:27.460> design<00:07:27.910> is

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
the Pikachu and I think this design is

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.790 
the Pikachu and I think this design is
pretty<00:07:28.180> cool<00:07:28.419> it<00:07:28.570> could<00:07:28.660> work<00:07:28.780> out<00:07:28.960> you<00:07:29.770> can

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
pretty cool it could work out you can

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.920 
pretty cool it could work out you can
set<00:07:30.610> up<00:07:30.639> more<00:07:30.850> Pikachu<00:07:31.240> dolls<00:07:31.419> or<00:07:31.600> you<00:07:31.660> can<00:07:31.780> try

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
set up more Pikachu dolls or you can try

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.750 
set up more Pikachu dolls or you can try
to<00:07:31.990> make<00:07:32.169> it<00:07:32.320> more<00:07:32.530> like<00:07:32.830> a<00:07:32.860> layout<00:07:33.460> to<00:07:33.490> where

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:33.760 
to make it more like a layout to where

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.850 
to make it more like a layout to where
you<00:07:34.300> have<00:07:34.449> to<00:07:34.630> follow<00:07:34.840> some<00:07:35.169> kind<00:07:35.380> of<00:07:35.410> path<00:07:35.590> and

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
you have to follow some kind of path and

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.800 
you have to follow some kind of path and
then<00:07:35.949> it<00:07:36.100> works<00:07:36.430> out<00:07:36.580> it<00:07:36.729> like<00:07:36.880> a<00:07:36.910> gym<00:07:37.210> but<00:07:37.750> I

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:37.810 
then it works out it like a gym but I

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.000 
then it works out it like a gym but I
think<00:07:38.020> that<00:07:38.139> this<00:07:38.229> brings<00:07:38.530> a<00:07:38.650> little<00:07:38.770> bit<00:07:38.889> of

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.010 
think that this brings a little bit of

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.550 
think that this brings a little bit of
both<00:07:39.220> and<00:07:39.550> it<00:07:39.850> works<00:07:40.030> out<00:07:40.270> pretty<00:07:40.600> cool<00:07:40.960> so<00:07:41.500> you
