00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
has a better chance against spiral but

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.250 
has a better chance against spiral but
even<00:03:09.830> then<00:03:10.040> duck<00:03:10.730> has<00:03:10.940> duck<00:03:11.240> is<00:03:11.420> loaded<00:03:11.930> yeah

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
even then duck has duck is loaded yeah

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
try this I believe my kicks lightly with

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.170 
try this I believe my kicks lightly with
a<00:05:14.100> trade<00:05:14.340> or<00:05:14.490> trade<00:05:14.700> it<00:05:15.050> killed<00:05:16.050> Sentinel

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
a trade or trade it killed Sentinel

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.040 
a trade or trade it killed Sentinel
probably<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.420> yeah<00:05:20.330> but<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:21.570> those<00:05:21.780> those

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
probably and yeah but it's those those

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.330 
probably and yeah but it's those those
inputs<00:05:22.410> are<00:05:22.500> really<00:05:22.740> hard<00:05:22.890> to<00:05:22.950> pull<00:05:23.190> off

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
inputs are really hard to pull off

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.680 
inputs are really hard to pull off
especially<00:05:23.610> when<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.090> superframe<00:05:24.480> in<00:05:24.630> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
especially when the superframe in the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.800 
especially when the superframe in the
reactivated<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:29.180> great<00:05:30.180> great<00:05:30.450> deal<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.630> the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
reactivated so a great great deal of the

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.660 
reactivated so a great great deal of the
match<00:05:30.960> obviously<00:05:31.500> it's<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.710> very<00:05:31.890> beginning<00:05:32.220> if

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
match obviously it's a very beginning if

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.010 
match obviously it's a very beginning if
Doug<00:05:32.910> gets<00:05:33.150> away<00:05:33.360> he<00:05:33.480> gets<00:05:33.630> chance<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:33.900> get

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
Doug gets away he gets chance to get

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.050 
Doug gets away he gets chance to get
started<00:05:34.290> so<00:05:34.710> let's<00:05:34.830> see<00:05:35.100> what<00:05:35.130> type<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.610> mix-up
