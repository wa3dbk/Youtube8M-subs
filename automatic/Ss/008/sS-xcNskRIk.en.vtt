target any corn on the field and Bennett
that<00:02:10.840> target<00:02:11.320> but<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.070> know<00:02:12.190> just<00:02:12.550> add<00:02:13.030> X<00:02:13.750> as

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
that target but you know just add X as

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.990 
that target but you know just add X as
more<00:02:14.530> packable<00:02:14.890> hey<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.580> sometimes<00:02:15.910> you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
more packable hey but sometimes you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.910 
more packable hey but sometimes you
might<00:02:16.090> need<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.270> get<00:02:16.450> rid<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.780> monster<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.350> it

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
might need to get rid of a monster so it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.500 
might need to get rid of a monster so it
works<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.280> great<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:21.120> bait<00:02:22.120> though<00:02:22.330> of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
works just great for that bait though of
