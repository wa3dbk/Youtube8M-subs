mm-hmm<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:33.950> don't<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:34.490> there's<00:03:34.790> any

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
mm-hmm I don't think there's any

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.150 
mm-hmm I don't think there's any
question<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.630> it's<00:03:36.410> just<00:03:36.680> if<00:03:36.950> you're

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
question about that it's just if you're

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.610 
question about that it's just if you're
a<00:03:37.220> couple<00:03:37.730> tenths<00:03:37.940> better<00:03:38.690> than<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.020> BMW<00:03:39.230> or

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
a couple tenths better than a BMW or

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.490 
a couple tenths better than a BMW or
Mercedes<00:03:40.210> you're<00:03:41.210> still<00:03:41.540> benchmarking<00:03:42.290> those

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
Mercedes you're still benchmarking those

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.820 
Mercedes you're still benchmarking those
cars<00:03:42.950> whereas<00:03:43.510> BMW<00:03:44.510> Mercedes<00:03:45.020> they<00:03:45.380> cannot

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
cars whereas BMW Mercedes they cannot

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.100 
cars whereas BMW Mercedes they cannot
replicate<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:47.240> old-school<00:03:47.510> Cadillac

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
replicate the old-school Cadillac

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.570 
replicate the old-school Cadillac
because<00:03:48.770> they<00:03:48.890> don't<00:03:49.040> have<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.190> heritage

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
because they don't have that heritage

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.190 
because they don't have that heritage
would<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.420> buy<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:50.690> over<00:03:51.700> C<00:03:52.700> plus<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.420> 3<00:03:53.840> Series

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
would you buy it over C plus a 3 Series

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.970 
would you buy it over C plus a 3 Series
an<00:03:54.830> Audi<00:03:55.010> a4<00:03:56.020> Infiniti<00:03:57.370> G<00:03:58.370> G<00:03:58.820> new<00:03:59.810> Lexus<00:04:00.380> IS<00:04:00.770> I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
an Audi a4 Infiniti G G new Lexus IS I

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.250 
an Audi a4 Infiniti G G new Lexus IS I
guess<00:04:01.310> some<00:04:01.940> extent

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
guess some extent

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.470 
guess some extent
but<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.550> point<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.450> first

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
but the point is that it's the first

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.559 
but the point is that it's the first
time<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.080> I<00:04:06.500> would<00:04:06.560> ever<00:04:07.209> test<00:04:08.209> drive<00:04:08.540> a

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
time that I would ever test drive a

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.140 
time that I would ever test drive a
Cadillac<00:04:09.049> at<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.159> same<00:04:10.370> time<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.640> would<00:04:10.879> test

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
Cadillac at the same time I would test

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.259 
Cadillac at the same time I would test
drive<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.450> BMW<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.650> an<00:04:12.739> Audi<00:04:12.950> in<00:04:13.159> a<00:04:13.250> Mercedes

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
drive a BMW and an Audi in a Mercedes

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.289 
drive a BMW and an Audi in a Mercedes
I<00:04:14.950> think<00:04:15.950> that's<00:04:16.100> saying<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.519> lot<00:04:16.549> right<00:04:17.060> there

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
I think that's saying a lot right there

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.789 
I think that's saying a lot right there
and<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.840> saying<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.199> lot<00:04:18.229> I<00:04:18.380> mean<00:04:18.650> it's

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
and that is saying a lot I mean it's

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.420 
and that is saying a lot I mean it's
giving<00:04:19.250> it's<00:04:19.639> like<00:04:20.079> daddy's<00:04:21.079> in<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.500> game<00:04:21.769> now

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
giving it's like daddy's in the game now

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.520 
giving it's like daddy's in the game now
there<00:04:22.639> it's<00:04:22.940> like<00:04:23.060> they're<00:04:23.600> part<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.350> big

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
there it's like they're part of the big

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.680 
there it's like they're part of the big
league<00:04:24.770> they<00:04:25.040> stepped<00:04:25.370> up<00:04:25.520> with<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:25.820> car<00:04:26.120> so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
league they stepped up with this car so

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.110 
league they stepped up with this car so
where<00:04:26.900> does<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.350> 80s<00:04:27.919> start<00:04:28.280> price-wise<00:04:28.729> I

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
where does the 80s start price-wise I

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.990 
where does the 80s start price-wise I
think<00:04:29.540> it's<00:04:29.660> like<00:04:29.830> $35,000<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.040> it's<00:04:31.550> right<00:04:31.820> in

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
think it's like $35,000 so it's right in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.360 
think it's like $35,000 so it's right in
there<00:04:32.180> with<00:04:32.360> c-class<00:04:32.990> 3-series<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.710> all<00:04:34.220> the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
there with c-class 3-series and all the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.640 
there with c-class 3-series and all the
