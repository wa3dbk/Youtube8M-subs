 asked the woman who collected 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.810
 The donation board noted that 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.760

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.579
 the fact that they are ideally southern and that's the whole 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.400
 cunning 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.340
 Glade thought and will put in the room 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 Polyana saw a room in the attic 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.609
 but first upset at once 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.740

 never no one was talking and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.549
