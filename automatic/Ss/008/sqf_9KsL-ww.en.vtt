00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
multiple late today I'm taking looked at

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.990 
multiple late today I'm taking looked at
a<00:00:03.750> new<00:00:03.990> mod<00:00:04.200> format<00:00:04.740> mouse<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.700> one<00:00:05.879> is

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
a new mod format mouse and this one is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.760 
a new mod format mouse and this one is
called<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.359> size<00:00:06.600> matters<00:00:07.170> mod<00:00:07.470> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
called the size matters mod and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.959 
called the size matters mod and
basically<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.210> does<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.920> it<00:00:10.969> configures

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
basically what it does is it configures

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.950 
basically what it does is it configures
cert<00:00:12.269> whenever<00:00:12.990> things<00:00:13.290> take<00:00:13.679> damage<00:00:14.960> they

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
cert whenever things take damage they

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.810 
cert whenever things take damage they
would<00:00:16.080> they<00:00:16.199> will<00:00:16.350> shrink<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.740> size<00:00:16.820> so

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
would they will shrink in size so

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
would they will shrink in size so
basically<00:00:18.390> everything's<00:00:18.869> size<00:00:19.380> will<00:00:19.680> be

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
basically everything's size will be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.019 
basically everything's size will be
proportionate<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> their<00:00:20.460> health

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
proportionate to their health

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.230 
proportionate to their health
