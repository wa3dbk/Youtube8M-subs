00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
look if I try to go over like normal I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.109 
look if I try to go over like normal I
fly<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:25.310> not<00:00:26.310> even<00:00:26.369> sure<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.060> is

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
fly and I I'm not even sure what this is

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.009 
fly and I I'm not even sure what this is
but<00:00:28.099> it's<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> weirdo<00:00:30.090> glitch<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.720> don't

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
but it's like a weirdo glitch I don't

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.330 
but it's like a weirdo glitch I don't
know<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.189> had<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> before<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:34.340> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
know if you had it before or not but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
know if you had it before or not but
it's<00:00:35.730> really<00:00:36.030> weird<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.780> should<00:00:37.200> I'll<00:00:37.350> show

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's really weird and I should I'll show

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.160 
it's really weird and I should I'll show
you<00:00:37.559> where<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.600> well<00:00:39.600> let<00:00:39.809> me<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:39.930> get

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
you where I got it well let me just get

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
you where I got it well let me just get
there<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:44.100> apparently<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.879> speeds<00:00:45.270> up

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
there and it apparently just speeds up

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.940 
there and it apparently just speeds up
everything<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:47.309> sure<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> does<00:00:48.030> but

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
everything I'm not sure what it does but

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
everything I'm not sure what it does but
see<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:49.980> something<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
see like something like that well this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.639 
see like something like that well this
is<00:00:52.079> where<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> found<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.190> cross

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
is where I found it right on that cross

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.400 
is where I found it right on that cross
well<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:57.090> any<00:00:57.539> Gulf<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> I

well first I is any Gulf like that I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
well first I is any Gulf like that I
went<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> i<00:00:59.940> went<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
went like this and i went out here and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
went like this and i went out here and
this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.350> i<00:01:01.379> started<00:01:01.710> doing<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.460> i

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
this is what i started doing and i

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
this is what i started doing and i
thought<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:02.910> funny<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> gone<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.719> tape

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
thought it was funny so I gone on tape

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
thought it was funny so I gone on tape
first<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.580> kept<00:01:05.909> doing<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.479> i

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
first and I just kept doing that and i

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
first and I just kept doing that and i
think<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> Reds<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> can

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
think this Reds you up so you can

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.719 
think this Reds you up so you can
actually<00:01:09.119> gain<00:01:09.479> speed<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.830> am<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.280> Venice

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
actually gain speed and I am in Venice

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.520 
actually gain speed and I am in Venice
as<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.200> as<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.500> see

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
as you can see and so and as you can see

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.910 
as you can see and so and as you can see

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
on speeding up which is the weird thing

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
on speeding up which is the weird thing
and<00:01:20.000> I'm<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.049> flying<00:01:22.490> my<00:01:23.490> foot<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and the weirdest part is at the top and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
and the weirdest part is at the top and
if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> keep<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.210> around<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
if you keep going around like this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you'll like see you'll sink into the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.890 
you'll like see you'll sink into the
building<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> weird<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.570> ok<00:01:36.570> now

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
building that's the weird thing ok now

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.120 
building that's the weird thing ok now
I'm<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.180> show<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.780> top

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
I'm going to go up and show you the top

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
I'm going to go up and show you the top
which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> weirdest<00:01:41.939> parts<00:01:42.439> if<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
which is one of the weirdest parts if I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
which is one of the weirdest parts if I
can<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.369> work<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.060> there's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
can get it to work because it there's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.200 
can get it to work because it there's
two<00:01:45.750> weird<00:01:46.170> different<00:01:46.619> things

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
I'm say okay now CX I'm speeding up and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.260 
I'm say okay now CX I'm speeding up and
this<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> word<00:01:59.679> part<00:01:59.950> i<00:02:00.189> can<00:02:00.640> get<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.939> do<00:02:01.090> it

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
this is the word part i can get to do it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.260 
this is the word part i can get to do it
you<00:02:01.899> actually<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.530> into<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.490> building<00:02:04.030> pretty

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
you actually go into the building pretty

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.480 
you actually go into the building pretty
much<00:02:04.509> if<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.319> keep<00:02:05.500> doing<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.189> look<00:02:06.369> how

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
much if you keep doing this but look how

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.680 
much if you keep doing this but look how
fast<00:02:06.789> I'm<00:02:07.000> going<00:02:08.759> now<00:02:09.759> if<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.209> can<00:02:10.269> get<00:02:10.479> them<00:02:10.599> to

fast I'm going now if I can get them to

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.259 
fast I'm going now if I can get them to
stop<00:02:12.629> hello<00:02:14.519> but<00:02:15.519> see<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:15.849> pretty<00:02:16.090> much<00:02:16.150> in
