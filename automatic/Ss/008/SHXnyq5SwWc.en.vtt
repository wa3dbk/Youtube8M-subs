 red and this one is super cute 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.319
 mainly because it ends 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.720
 tomato and I like red lipstick more 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.519
 mathieu do not know why my lips 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.040

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.040
 in me then I'll show you 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.900
 the color is to see this way 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:38.180
 so it's super beautiful, how I said something 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.920
 and the matt finish that also a piece 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.849
 super joker like I said at the beginning 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.010
 people for being an investment is cool 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.129
 you have different colors then this 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.079
 selection I think will help you get started 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.790
 grandchild maybe an idea of ​​what to charge is 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.250

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.099
 so come on one with a very very beautiful 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.170
 thinking of winter is a beautiful thing 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.299
 which I would use I would like for winter 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.980
 is defendant and the finishing is chatinha 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.170
 He is very very handsome and well marked. 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.329
 I think it matches with 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.430
 any skin without being a brunette 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.500
 You're very white. 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.299
 I think the one that matches 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.519
 any skin type is tighter 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.069
 To prove it is also super beautiful so I 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.769
 I can imagine without makeup a make 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.510
 super neutral with lipsticks a month so 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.310
 just calling attention to the mouth that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.079
 it would look beautiful right? 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.319
 imagine in winter with button are 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.970
 diseases that perfect 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.190

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.810
 Last because this here is the lipstick 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.760
