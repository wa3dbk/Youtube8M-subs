really<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> piece<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.780> paper<00:02:39.870> itself<00:02:40.610> it's<00:02:41.610> more

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
really a piece of paper itself it's more

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.330 
really a piece of paper itself it's more
like<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.950> film<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.950> won't<00:02:47.160> be

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
like a a film like this so it won't be

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.370 
like a a film like this so it won't be

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
the bottom part which is gray it would

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.940 
the bottom part which is gray it would
be<00:02:52.160> where<00:02:53.160> my<00:02:53.790> finger<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.150> it'd<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.740> kind

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
be where my finger is it'd be that kind

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.280 
be where my finger is it'd be that kind
of<00:02:56.010> paper<00:02:56.190> you'd<00:02:56.910> print<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.450> your<00:02:57.630> image<00:02:57.960> on
