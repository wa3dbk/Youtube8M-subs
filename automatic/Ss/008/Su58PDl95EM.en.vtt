about the piano they have their own runs
and<00:00:23.650> a<00:00:23.829> run<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.339> essentially<00:00:24.939> a<00:00:25.119> quick<00:00:25.810> quick

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and a run is essentially a quick quick

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.540 
and a run is essentially a quick quick
compilation<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:27.509> many<00:00:28.509> many<00:00:28.749> notes<00:00:29.019> it<00:00:29.259> can<00:00:29.380> be

so basically though let me just say
you'll<00:01:17.530> begin<00:01:17.860> on<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.100> note<00:01:18.370> this<00:01:18.760> is<00:01:18.940> finger<00:01:19.090> 1

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
you'll begin on a note this is finger 1

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.130 
you'll begin on a note this is finger 1
2<00:01:19.690> 3

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
2 3

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.950 
2 3
you'll<00:01:20.710> cross<00:01:21.040> over<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.700> next<00:01:21.880> note<00:01:22.690> and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
you'll cross over to the next note and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.110 
you'll cross over to the next note and
then<00:01:23.260> begin<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.560> do<00:01:23.740> 1<00:01:23.920> 2<00:01:24.040> 3<00:01:24.280> 4<00:01:24.520> 5<00:01:24.729> let<00:01:24.940> me<00:01:25.000> do

then begin to do 1 2 3 4 5 let me do

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.340 
then begin to do 1 2 3 4 5 let me do
that<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.300> little<00:01:25.570> bit<00:01:25.720> slower<00:01:25.990> for<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
that a little bit slower for you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.770 
that a little bit slower for you

beginners so we have starting on middle
C<00:01:29.370> ok<00:01:30.370> middle<00:01:30.729> C<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:30.940> found<00:01:31.299> to<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.930> direct

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
C ok middle C is found to the direct

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.969

are different these runs are very
similar<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.760> scales<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.300> I've<00:02:34.480> just

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
similar to the scales that I've just

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.210 
similar to the scales that I've just
showed<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.020> practice<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.770> develop<00:02:35.920> your

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
showed you to practice to develop your

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.180 
showed you to practice to develop your
running<00:02:36.610> skills<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:38.650> have<00:02:38.860> we're

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
running skills so here we have we're

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.290 
running skills so here we have we're
gonna<00:02:39.280> start<00:02:39.520> with<00:02:39.580> our<00:02:39.640> second<00:02:40.030> finger<00:02:40.150> in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
gonna start with our second finger in

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.850 
gonna start with our second finger in
this<00:02:40.450> one<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> fingerings<00:02:41.560> are<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.740> little

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
this one so the fingerings are a little

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
this one so the fingerings are a little
different<00:02:42.100> like<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.430> said<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.780> develop

you've<00:03:01.300> developed<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.780> your<00:03:01.900> scales<00:03:02.170> will

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
you've developed in your scales will

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.620 
you've developed in your scales will
come<00:03:02.860> into<00:03:03.010> play<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.580> real<00:03:03.820> sheet<00:03:04.120> music<00:03:04.450> for

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
come into play in real sheet music for

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.030 
come into play in real sheet music for
you<00:03:04.810> happy<00:03:05.500> practicing<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.220> Kendall<00:03:06.730> McGuire
