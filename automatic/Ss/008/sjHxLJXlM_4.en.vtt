prefer<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.450> already<00:02:37.930> frozen<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.940> cut<00:02:40.209> in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
prefer I already frozen and I cut in

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.640 
prefer I already frozen and I cut in
half<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:43.110> frypan<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.410> have

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
half because of the frypan that I have

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.180 
half because of the frypan that I have
here<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.750> can<00:02:46.990> kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.350> make<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> smaller

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
here so you can kind of make a smaller

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.230 
here so you can kind of make a smaller
or<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.000> way<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.480> big<00:02:49.990> one<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.640> case<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.030> cut

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
or the way it is big one this case I cut

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.720 
or the way it is big one this case I cut
it<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.420> half<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:52.810> easy<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.290> fry<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.620> which<00:02:54.520> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
it in half it's easy to fry it which it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.690 
it in half it's easy to fry it which it
doesn't<00:02:55.090> affect<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.540> at<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.490> all

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
doesn't affect it at all see it's all
