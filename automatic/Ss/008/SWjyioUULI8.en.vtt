00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Upon the hill on Calvary

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He came from Heaven's throne

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Our fallenness and mercy meet

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Where blood and water flow

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What grace divine what selflessness

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That Christ would bear the weight

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Our proof is scarred on hands that bled

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That we were worth every nail

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And all the praise and glory to God

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For the King has carried the cross

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He is risen from the grave

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Beyond the tomb to holy skies

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
He rose in victory

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And bridged for us the great divide

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
His life is our liberty

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And all the praise and glory to God

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
For the King has carried the cross

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
He is risen from the grave

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And all the praise and glory to God

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
For the King has carried the cross

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
He is risen from the grave
