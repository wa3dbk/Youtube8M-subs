00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
just some roadmap instructions for this

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.380 
just some roadmap instructions for this
particular<00:00:30.269> example<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:31.560> start<00:00:32.390> dynamically

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
particular example we start dynamically

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
particular example we start dynamically
we<00:00:33.510> start<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:33.840> fortissimo<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.550> quarter

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
we start at fortissimo the first quarter

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.139 
we start at fortissimo the first quarter
note<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> roof<00:00:37.440> top<00:00:37.620> accent<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.280> okay<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
note has a roof top accent on it okay so

then<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> dynamic<00:00:45.420> shifts<00:00:46.760> immediately<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
then the dynamic shifts immediately to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.689 
then the dynamic shifts immediately to
met<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.210> piano<00:00:51.260> okay<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.980> we'll<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.520> our

the adjustments before before you play

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.100 
the adjustments before before you play
you<00:03:55.280> did<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.459> fine<00:03:55.640> job<00:03:55.700> reading<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.570> notation

you did a fine job reading the notation
a<00:03:57.519> couple<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.610> things<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.910> look<00:03:59.030> out<00:03:59.239> for<00:03:59.450> one

a couple of things to look out for one

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.890 
a couple of things to look out for one
are<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.530> dynamics<00:04:01.269> pretty<00:04:02.269> much<00:04:02.450> from<00:04:02.630> start

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
are the dynamics pretty much from start

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.290 
are the dynamics pretty much from start
to<00:04:03.019> finish<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.500> were<00:04:03.590> playing<00:04:03.830> at<00:04:03.950> Forte<00:04:04.400> all

the<00:04:06.290> intro<00:04:06.590> starts<00:04:06.860> fortissimo<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.730> then<00:04:07.850> it
