00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 yes hello dear model friends my 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.220
 name is 49 years old live rheda 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.070
 wiedenbrÃ¼ck and my big hobby is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.740
 the flight modeler special 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 helicopter I got my first one in 1989 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.710
 Remote controlled helicopter coming 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.840
 It was then the helicopter bell 47 g 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.000
 a very well known German 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 Model construction company and I want you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 once a part of this model weather 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 thought the fuselage with the swimmer 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:39.469
 pay once and introduce this 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.600
 The model is about 35 years old 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.680
 Restoring what I need 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.809
 this helicopter so far 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
 restored that is the so-called 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.730
 dwell calls all this is this gray 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 front part 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.719
 I sanded off completely then 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.300
 wet the sandpaper with 1000 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.280
 sanded down so I followed 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 the model then once the front part 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 and we could and have these 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.830
 original matching gray tone mixed 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.830
 and then I have it with the spray gun 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.750
 lacquer which is behind the Fricktal 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 not restored yet like her 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 but they probably do not see it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.880
 portion strive to be 98 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.700
 Unfortunately, I could not do that anymore 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.840
 get used to so sustained 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.009
 everyone's manual skills 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 these are the matching parts 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.759
 establish themselves but need quite well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 tell about this helicopter 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.770
 As I said before , they want to produce one 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.540
 great well-known German 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.950
 model company in the years of 1975 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.939
 until 1985 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 The model has a touch 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.659
 rotor diameter later of 990 mm and 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.740
 just under a meter in length is driven 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.329
 it with a 4.08 cubic centimeter engine 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.439
 or 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.869
 but now quite clever 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.939
 model aviator build this oldtimer 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.939
 model also already on electric motor 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.149
 with the latest brushless and love 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.009
 technology 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.959
 These are not the original anymore 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.299
 swimmers are not available anymore 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.519
 the original swimmer mario fehr so 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.549
 long were maybe short third 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.689
 500 I say less and also something 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.849
 narrower these swimmers are currently 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.739
 on the internet, they only need worse 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.900
 then we also enter the company 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.609
 they are even worse 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.489
 distributed and ideally suited to the 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.680
 I just got them 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.140
 I took the old bike aspiration 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.849
 you can also from the normal 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.829
 I think take skid suspension I show 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.950
 once the original curve ride that is 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.230
 this is what the helicopter original 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.840
 we delivered on we have the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.709
 lateral striving taken on purpose 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.500
 new float carrier screwed with 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.510
 The three screws fits perfectly 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.099
 good also holds unlikely 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.359
 stable 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.829
 especially for the first training flights 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.720
 is and always colored of course always 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.970
 Ideal if it is one 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 assumption indicates that the landing also 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.290
 fought but of course it has this 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.930
 typical appearance of the world are 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.139
 ece with the swimmers looks natural 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.430
 Fantastic out of the cabin , of course 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.889
 I already have a lot of equipment 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.269
 also very very old but as I said 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.609
 I'll buy another one 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.799
 So there are several internet providers 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.940
 the one on this pulpit kit yet 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.989
 reproduce for this beautiful model 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 but as I said I let them only once 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.370
 flies with the old original can 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.449
 still for training flights to play 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.099
 of course, comes a new pulpit off 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.260
 here I once runs the 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.409
 original tanker meet at this 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.310
 model at the whole browsers back then 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.169
 were delivered 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.180
 the more like this when the long 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.879
 be screwed around vasic it comes 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.379
 more and more the appearance of the 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.379
 Billie Jean 40 is a screwdriver 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.269
 as said the helicopter was then 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.579
 at the time he's from cambodia 75 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.209
 this remote control became for it 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.500
 recommended 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.090
 the vario pop 12 it was back then 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.970
 actually the most modern thing 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.770
 initially not on marc faber 475 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.330
 always the original years one this one 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.530
 model was developed 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:36.360
 12 channels easily 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.889
 10 11 12 12 channels was already a lot 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.539
 her costume of an empty plate 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.240
 we probably screw the right piece 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:48.389
 what was put in it and it would have to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.210
 actually a 27 march to three here 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.520
 I have an original again 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.009
 prospect from that time where 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.009
 This model is pictured here 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.990
 it is also on the frankfurter 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.669
 Airport I think was taken 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.320
 from the tower would have the old 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.979
 frankfurter airport so be 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.710
 Airport employee faces the 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.680
 we have graupner model bell 47 give 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.750
 then once again the model in the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.919
 Prospect view about it the big one 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.240
 Brother of the World 212 quintet of the year 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.849
 In 1973 came on the market and believe too 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.310
 I still use the original until 1981 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.310
 mechanics has been in the delivery program 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.610
 I 'll be up every now and then 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.669
 youtube 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.349
 from this model the construction progresses 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.000
 Imagine next time we will 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.909
 then just with the individual 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.750
 mechanics components grapple 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.930
 the line also trains all 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.520
 disassembled on the table and then 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.110
 I would always a video in 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.699
 put back to the construction progress 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.699
 or the restoration progress 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.930
 I am now thanking you 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.120
 First of all, very much for your 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.710
 Attention to us 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.710
 our next reunion euro or
