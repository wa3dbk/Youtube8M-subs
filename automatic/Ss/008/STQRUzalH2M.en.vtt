00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
with liquid nitrogen it's just so hard

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
with liquid nitrogen it's just so hard
you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> parent<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.070> home<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:32.969> get

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the liquid nitrogen so let their

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
the liquid nitrogen so let their
children<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
but always could take it one step

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.610

make it harder so the pipe in goes on

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.899 
make it harder so the pipe in goes on
top<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.610> it

know what you call them as a kid but
we'd<00:01:29.880> finish<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.630> today<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> was

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
we'd finish it go to today and it was

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
we'd finish it go to today and it was
our<00:01:31.890> signal<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> mom<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.150> were<00:01:33.270> done

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
our signal to mom that we were done

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
our signal to mom that we were done
alright<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.409> goes<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
alright so this goes here like this and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
alright so this goes here like this and
then<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.270> goes<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.900> alright<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
then this goes here alright so it's a

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740 
then this goes here alright so it's a
little<00:01:38.009> inertia<00:01:38.400> demonstration<00:01:39.210> fair<00:01:39.540> enough

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
little inertia demonstration fair enough

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
little inertia demonstration fair enough
so<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.799> hand<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.490> go<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:41.909> you're

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so your hand is going to go here you're

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.490 
so your hand is going to go here you're
going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> pull<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> hit

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
going to pull back you're going to hit

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
going to pull back you're going to hit
the<00:01:43.680> pan<00:01:43.920> yeah<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> cause<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the pan yeah it's going to cause the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.999 
the pan yeah it's going to cause the
energy<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.930> travel<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> toilet<00:01:46.829> paper

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
energy to travel to the toilet paper

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.230 
energy to travel to the toilet paper
roll<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> knock<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> way

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
roll it's going to knock out of the way

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
roll it's going to knock out of the way
the<00:01:48.420> inertia<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> egg<00:01:49.079> holds<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> there

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the inertia of the egg holds it there

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
the inertia of the egg holds it there
for<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> second<00:01:50.100> BAM<00:01:50.369> falls<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
for a second BAM falls in and if you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830 
for a second BAM falls in and if you
don't<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.799> 11<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.399> tries<00:01:53.670> okay<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
don't do it I 11 more tries okay got it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
don't do it I 11 more tries okay got it
alright<00:01:55.490> you're<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.700> fine<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.090> so
