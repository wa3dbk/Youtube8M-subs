00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 tells crowd a pleasure to have them here you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.670
 that is there with your note of enem and not 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.820
 knows how to calculate your average 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.520
 in this and got the result is 59 and now 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.980
 Wow, what I do with it is the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 Professor Paul is here to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 give you that strength 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 there are actually two ways of you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.420
 calculate their average in enem there is 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 which we call simple average and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 there is a complex average obvious that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.489
 calculation of the simple mean is more 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.660
 than the complex one. 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.090
 sisu and prouni will use the average 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 simple then the simple average is the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.219
 used for you to understand how 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.460
 It is estimated I brought your knots here. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.030
 do not suppose that writing you write 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 well then you took 900 on the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.899
 science of nature 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 you made my course full numerology 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.330
 also took 900 in math you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:14.119
 drew 840 in humans 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.960
 you took 700 in languages ​​you took 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.900
 720 good 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.159
 in the case of the simple average you will get 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.930
 these five notes will add the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.869
 the result will give 4060 and from there 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.990
 you get that end result that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 divide by five and so you will have the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.900
 your average is going to be 812 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 then this is your simple average is the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.270
 Note that you will work for example 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.700
 The Federal University of Santa Catarina 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.799
 it uses the simple mean then when 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.619
 you I do your calculations it 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.780
 using the note from enem is this average 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.680
 that you will use 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.469
 Now the case when the complex medium 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.829
 that it is used when college 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.590
 gives weight to your exams for example 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.989
 faculty may think that the guy who 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.870
 will biology have to have a weight 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.940
 higher in the nature science test 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.580
 company than the others a guy who 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.430
 going to do engineering have to have a weight 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.269
 higher in the math test than in the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.280
 others 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.220
 who does this for example is federal 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.819
 and then you will use 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.159
 the complex medium is flattened and John as 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.069
 that I will know the weight that is given 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.840
 Do you get on college edict? 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.510
 so you go there in the college edict 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.000
 who is trying and there will be the weights 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.319
 that she gives to the evidence of enem 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.190
 so I'll get it here to show you 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.989
 how do you calculate the same notes and weights? 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.140
 which are used by the Bahia Federal 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.489
 for example they are in Bahia Federal a 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.980
 she has three natures 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:04.970
 weight 2 mathematics have weight 2 human have 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.430
 weight 3 and languages ​​have weight 2 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.430
 on average complete the complex what you 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.349
 gonna make you will get every note and 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.109
 will multiply your hair's weight 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.459
 then you will get it in writing in 900 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:26.389
 3 times will give 2 thousand and 700 in nature 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:32.750
 the 900 times 2 will give 1800 in 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:37.310
 mathematics 840 times 2,681 human 700 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:42.319
 times 32 thousand and 100 in 720 language 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.470
 times 2 will give 1,440 now you pick up 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.290
 these notes that you calculated and only more 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.709
 five and then you will get the result of 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.639
 nine thousand seven hundred and twenty calm 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.349
 It's not over 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:04:01.519
 now you will get this 9720 and it will 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.849
 divided by the sum of the weights that 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:11.900
 if it will give 3 plus two plus two more 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:17.090
 three plus two will give 12 9720/12 and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.719
 your note will be 810 quiet grandson in 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.810
 Simple average pick up was five notes some 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.870
 life for five thala your note on 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.139
 complex 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.610
 take each note multiply by your 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:36.840
 then add up the five results and 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.680
 of life this final result by the sum 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.470
 of prices 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.020
 and then you will calmly have your 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.110
 average and I expect from the bottom of 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.310
 heart you have a great average 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.400
 and can enter university and become 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.740
 Do you like biology? Do not forget to 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.440

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.919
 subscribe to our channel here on youtube 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.690
 gives a gem if the video that helped 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.660
 share to help pass the 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.330
 guru's message needless to say that 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:17.690
 It was a great pleasure being here with you. 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.690
 a big hug already all
