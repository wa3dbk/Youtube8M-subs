00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.460 
and my own personality through reading
this<00:01:39.329> book<00:01:39.630> number<00:01:40.020> two

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
this book number two

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.609 
this book number two
inside<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> Yoga<00:01:41.700> Sutras<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.350> can't

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
inside the Yoga Sutras now you can't

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.080 
inside the Yoga Sutras now you can't
really<00:01:43.829> consider<00:01:44.250> yourself<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> yogi<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
really consider yourself a yogi if you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
really consider yourself a yogi if you
haven't<00:01:45.329> read<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> Yoga<00:01:45.930> Sutras<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.740> least

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
haven't read the Yoga Sutras or at least

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
haven't read the Yoga Sutras or at least
on<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> philosophical<00:01:47.939> deeper<00:01:48.270> yoga<00:01:48.540> level

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on that philosophical deeper yoga level

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.810 
on that philosophical deeper yoga level
so<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> read<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> Yoga<00:01:50.220> Sutras<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
so you want to read the Yoga Sutras and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
so you want to read the Yoga Sutras and
there's<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.600> many<00:01:51.659> translations<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> may

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there's so many translations and you may

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
there's so many translations and you may
get<00:01:52.920> confused<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.399> which<00:01:53.610> translation<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
get confused about which translation to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
get confused about which translation to
read<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.990> I'm<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> recommend<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.100> one

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
read and I'm going to recommend this one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.060 
read and I'm going to recommend this one
which<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.969> surprising<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:58.070> it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
which is kind of surprising because it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.050 
which is kind of surprising because it
is<00:01:59.460> written<00:02:00.240> by<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> reverend<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.670> can't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
is written by a reverend and I can't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.999 
is written by a reverend and I can't
even<00:02:03.149> remember<00:02:03.299> how<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.140> particular<00:02:04.409> copy

even remember how this particular copy

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
even remember how this particular copy
got<00:02:05.250> recommended<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.939> me<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.329> again<00:02:06.630> we'll

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
got recommended to me but again we'll

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839

I really love this because there's a

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.360 
I really love this because there's a
translation<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.440> each<00:02:53.590> Sutra<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.190> then

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
translation of each Sutra and then

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.460 
translation of each Sutra and then
there's<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.580> commentary<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.660> each<00:02:55.720> Sutra<00:02:56.260> and

there's a commentary on each Sutra and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.090 
there's a commentary on each Sutra and
he<00:02:57.070> also<00:02:57.420> explains<00:02:58.420> how<00:02:58.630> each<00:02:58.840> word<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.980> be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
he also explains how each word can be

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.440 
he also explains how each word can be
translated<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.880> can<00:03:01.000> also<00:03:01.120> kind<00:03:01.300> of

translated so you can also kind of

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.750 
translated so you can also kind of
invent<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.810> own<00:03:01.920> translations<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.370> CSIs

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760

me<00:05:45.610> when<00:05:45.909> I<00:05:45.940> was<00:05:46.180> initially<00:05:46.810> reading<00:05:47.380> this

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:47.529 
me when I was initially reading this

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.080 
me when I was initially reading this
because<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:48.009> made<00:05:48.250> me<00:05:48.279> realize<00:05:48.729> that<00:05:48.759> there

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
because it made me realize that there

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.430 
because it made me realize that there
are<00:05:49.180> so<00:05:49.300> many<00:05:49.330> voices<00:05:49.659> in<00:05:49.930> my<00:05:50.020> head<00:05:50.259> that

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
are so many voices in my head that

are so many voices in my head that
weren't<00:05:50.860> me<00:05:51.130> and<00:05:51.430> somehow<00:05:52.029> by<00:05:52.300> naming<00:05:52.750> them<00:05:52.900> it

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
weren't me and somehow by naming them it

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.040 
weren't me and somehow by naming them it
really<00:05:53.770> took<00:05:53.949> a<00:05:54.069> lot<00:05:54.219> of<00:05:54.250> power<00:05:54.639> away<00:05:55.270> from<00:05:55.300> the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
really took a lot of power away from the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.990 
really took a lot of power away from the
voice<00:05:56.229> and<00:05:56.680> you<00:05:56.889> know<00:05:56.979> helps<00:05:57.490> you<00:05:57.580> bring<00:05:57.759> in
