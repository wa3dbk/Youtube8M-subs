Russell<00:00:09.840> Westbrook<00:00:10.320> crossover<00:00:13.190> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
Russell Westbrook crossover this is a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.039 
Russell Westbrook crossover this is a
move<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.880> personally<00:00:15.179> use<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.540> lot<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
move that I personally use a lot and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.450 
move that I personally use a lot and
that<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> think<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.859> great<00:00:17.039> move<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.430> all

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
that I think it's a great move for all

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.370 
that I think it's a great move for all
players<00:00:17.880> because<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> pretty<00:00:19.050> simple

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
players because it's a pretty simple

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.410 
players because it's a pretty simple
move<00:00:19.800> there's<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.490> much<00:00:20.670> risk<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.180> turnover

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
move there's not much risk of a turnover

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
move there's not much risk of a turnover
with<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.930> move<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.070> effective

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
with this move and it's a very effective

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.220 
with this move and it's a very effective
move<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> lot<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.269> times<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.600> tell<00:00:24.810> my<00:00:24.960> players

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
move so a lot of times I tell my players

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.099 
move so a lot of times I tell my players
that<00:00:25.590> no<00:00:26.460> move<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.029> better<00:00:27.240> than<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.689> move<00:00:27.930> in

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
that no move is better than a move in

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
that no move is better than a move in
some<00:00:28.380> situations<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> what

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
some situations so that's kind of what

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
some situations so that's kind of what
this<00:00:30.330> movie<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.720> because<00:00:30.960> there's<00:00:31.349> no<00:00:31.470> really

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this movie is because there's no really

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340 
this movie is because there's no really
illusion<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> they're<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.200> trying

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
illusion to it they're not really trying

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.630 
illusion to it they're not really trying
to<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> defense<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> shift<00:00:35.430> their<00:00:35.610> weight

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
to get the defense to shift their weight

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
to get the defense to shift their weight
or<00:00:35.850> anything<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.540> basically<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
or anything it's basically just the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.900 
or anything it's basically just the
change<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> speed<00:00:37.980> change<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> direction

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
change of speed change the direction

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 

okay<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.340> now<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> reason

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
okay so that's the move now the reason

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.609 
okay so that's the move now the reason
this<00:01:09.329> move<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.810> effective<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.409> said

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this move is so effective like I said

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.920 
this move is so effective like I said
before<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> change<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.060> speed<00:01:12.329> change

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
before is it's a change of speed change

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.289 
before is it's a change of speed change
the<00:01:13.049> direction<00:01:13.229> okay<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:13.970> when<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.090> coming

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the direction okay so when you're coming

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
the direction okay so when you're coming
down<00:01:15.390> before<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> switch

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
down before all you can do is switch

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.429 
down before all you can do is switch
hands<00:01:17.369> okay<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> switch<00:01:18.960> hands<00:01:19.259> on

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
hands okay so when you switch hands on

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.260 
hands okay so when you switch hands on
the<00:01:19.500> defender<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.580> might<00:01:20.789> make<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the defender that might make them to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.179 
the defender that might make them to
make<00:01:21.509> them<00:01:21.720> adjust<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.289> bit<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.039> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
make them adjust a little bit and that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.529 
make them adjust a little bit and that
might<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.729> move<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.210> bit<00:01:24.360> now

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
might make them move a little bit now

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.690 
might make them move a little bit now
the<00:01:25.439> thing<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> makes<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.009> reward<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the thing that makes this reward now is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.570 
the thing that makes this reward now is
that<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.390> move<00:01:27.570> after<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.340> crossover<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.490> I'm

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
that the move after the crossover so I'm

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.060 
that the move after the crossover so I'm
going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> come<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.689> hands<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.830> what<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
going to come down with hands now what I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.279 
going to come down with hands now what I
do<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.850> step<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
do is I'm going to step here this is

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.510 
do is I'm going to step here this is
going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> give<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> illusion<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.159> I'm

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
going to give the illusion that I'm

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.120 
going to give the illusion that I'm
crossing<00:01:36.360> back<00:01:36.509> over<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.289> going<00:01:37.860> here

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
crossing back over and I'm going here

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.910 
crossing back over and I'm going here
and<00:01:38.490> come<00:01:39.330> back<00:01:39.659> over<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.440> what<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:40.740> really

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and come back over but what I'm really

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.889 
and come back over but what I'm really
doing<00:01:41.039> is<00:01:41.459> this<00:01:42.000> step<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.569> to<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.750> my

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
doing is this step is going to be my

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
doing is this step is going to be my
explosion<00:01:43.500> step<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> load<00:01:44.819> up

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
explosion step so I'm going to load up
