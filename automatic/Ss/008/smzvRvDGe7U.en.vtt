00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but this this WebWorks has been much

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
but this this WebWorks has been much
much<00:00:47.399> stronger<00:00:47.700> than<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> coffee<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.660> still

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
much stronger than the coffee I still

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.220 
much stronger than the coffee I still
write<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> copy<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.789> web<00:00:51.000> works<00:00:51.270> my

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
write the copy but the web works my

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.959 
write the copy but the web works my
opinion<00:00:52.590> has<00:00:52.739> been<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> much<00:00:53.160> stronger<00:00:53.640> bike

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
opinion has been a much stronger bike

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.709 
opinion has been a much stronger bike
and<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> lot<00:00:55.770> lot<00:00:56.100> cheaper<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.390> finish

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and it's a lot lot cheaper the finish

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.250 
and it's a lot lot cheaper the finish
it's<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.739> smooth<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.899> car<00:01:00.899> few<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
it's not as smooth as the car few but a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
it's not as smooth as the car few but a
smaller<00:01:01.559> still<00:01:02.100> organic<00:01:02.579> that's<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.239> that's
