00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.039 

it's<00:00:11.160> very<00:00:11.309> important<00:00:11.789> for<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.999> hooker<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.599> have

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
it's very important for a hooker to have

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.570 
it's very important for a hooker to have
a<00:00:13.080> clean<00:00:13.379> channel<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.919> have<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.039> clean<00:00:14.309> strike

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
a clean channel and have a clean strike

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.919 
a clean channel and have a clean strike
because<00:00:14.879> if<00:00:15.029> you<00:00:15.629> are

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
because if you are

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.929 
because if you are
getting<00:00:16.230> your<00:00:16.379> own<00:00:16.560> ball<00:00:17.130> away<00:00:17.250> quickly<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
getting your own ball away quickly and

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.640 
getting your own ball away quickly and
then<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.539> puts<00:00:18.630> enormous<00:00:18.900> amount<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> pressure

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
then it puts enormous amount of pressure

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.689 
then it puts enormous amount of pressure
on<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.099> rest<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> scrimmage

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
on the rest of the scrimmage

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.720 
on the rest of the scrimmage
particularly<00:00:21.360> if<00:00:22.110> you're<00:00:22.410> suffering<00:00:22.800> from<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
particularly if you're suffering from a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.850 
particularly if you're suffering from a
bad<00:00:24.029> weight<00:00:24.270> disadvantage<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.259> so<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
bad weight disadvantage and so on so

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.710 
bad weight disadvantage and so on so
there<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.579> certain<00:00:26.880> sequence<00:00:27.270> of<00:00:27.390> events

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there are certain sequence of events

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.300 
there are certain sequence of events
which<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.020> religiously<00:00:28.560> carried<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.070> will

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
which if religiously carried out will

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.260 
which if religiously carried out will
help<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.669> do<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
help you do that

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.299 
help you do that
I<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.869> most<00:00:31.079> important<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.860> get<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I just most important that we get I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.759 
I just most important that we get I
particularly<00:00:33.269> get<00:00:33.480> close<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:34.019> my<00:00:34.320> loose<00:00:34.559> head

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
particularly get close to my loose head

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:35.990 
particularly get close to my loose head
and<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.980> he<00:00:35.070> pulls<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.670> his<00:00:35.790> right

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and that he pulls me in with his right

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.630 
and that he pulls me in with his right
arm<00:00:36.589> so<00:00:37.589> I'm<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.860> split<00:00:38.190> by<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> opposition

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
arm so I'm not split by the opposition

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.329 
arm so I'm not split by the opposition
tie<00:00:39.059> Ted<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:40.019> I'm<00:00:40.140> quite<00:00:40.470> or<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.220> there's

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
tie Ted and I'm quite or and there's

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.070 
tie Ted and I'm quite or and there's
near<00:00:41.519> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> ball<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.089> I<00:00:42.210> possibly<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.839> be

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
near to the ball as I possibly can be

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.049 
near to the ball as I possibly can be
from<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.460> important<00:00:44.850> than<00:00:44.970> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
from then on it's important than the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420 
from then on it's important than the
hips<00:00:45.269> are<00:00:45.449> loose<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.900> they<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.769> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
hips are loose so they can get the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.969 
hips are loose so they can get the
mobility<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.629> ability<00:00:49.019> to<00:00:49.229> strike<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
mobility and the ability to strike in a

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.280 
mobility and the ability to strike in a
lower<00:00:50.190> position<00:00:50.369> which<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.479> increasingly

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
lower position which is increasingly

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.079 
lower position which is increasingly
more<00:00:52.830> difficult<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.549> you<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.909> up<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
more difficult as you go up the

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.869 
more difficult as you go up the
representative<00:00:55.080> scale<00:00:55.489> once<00:00:56.489> I've<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:56.820> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
representative scale once I've done that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
representative scale once I've done that
I<00:00:57.299> should<00:00:57.900> be<00:00:58.440> able<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.799> hook<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> ball<00:00:59.250> even

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I should be able to hook the ball even

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.000 
I should be able to hook the ball even
if<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.390> tightness<00:01:00.869> come<00:01:01.049> pouring<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.830> me

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
if the tightness come pouring in on me

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
if the tightness come pouring in on me
and<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.189> can't<00:01:02.339> particularly<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> ball

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and I can't particularly see the ball

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
and I can't particularly see the ball
they're<00:01:04.199> all<00:01:04.320> excited<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.070> particular

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
they're all excited on my particular

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.960 
they're all excited on my particular
ball<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.390> keep<00:01:06.570> me<00:01:06.920> steady<00:01:07.970> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
ball I think is to keep me steady it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
ball I think is to keep me steady it's
important<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:09.930> shoulder<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.710> kept

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
important that my right shoulder is kept

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
important that my right shoulder is kept
steady<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.450> something<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
steady so that I can have something to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
steady so that I can have something to
lean<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.650> weight<00:01:13.680> basically

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
lean on and put all my weight basically

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
lean on and put all my weight basically
on<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:14.970> arm<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> left<00:01:15.960> foot<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
on my right arm and the left foot so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.150 
on my right arm and the left foot so
that<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.890> hips<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:18.090> leg<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.470> able<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
that my hips and right leg are able to

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.430 
that my hips and right leg are able to
be<00:01:20.250> free<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.700> swing<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> strike<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.960> ball<00:01:22.110> or

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
be free to swing and strike the ball or

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.080 
be free to swing and strike the ball or
whatever<00:01:22.620> direction<00:01:23.370> and<00:01:23.520> whatever<00:01:23.760> speed<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
whatever direction and whatever speed I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330 
whatever direction and whatever speed I
like<00:01:24.450> also<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.470> important<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.010> tighted

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like also it's important for the tighted

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.690 
like also it's important for the tighted
to<00:01:26.460> adopt<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> position<00:01:27.240> whereby<00:01:28.200> he<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.700> stop

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to adopt a position whereby he can stop

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
to adopt a position whereby he can stop
any<00:01:29.910> shield<00:01:30.120> that's<00:01:30.240> transmitted<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
any shield that's transmitted from the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.440 
any shield that's transmitted from the
opposition<00:01:31.920> pack<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.909> you're<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.150> sure<00:01:33.390> about

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
opposition pack so you're not sure about

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
opposition pack so you're not sure about
quickly<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.440> strike<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.800> be<00:01:34.890> got<00:01:35.040> away

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
quickly so the strike can be got away

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.250 
quickly so the strike can be got away
and<00:01:35.790> whatever<00:01:36.000> amount<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.510> pressure<00:01:36.720> under

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
and whatever amount of pressure under

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.800 
and whatever amount of pressure under
the<00:01:38.070> ball<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.730> flipped<00:01:39.300> away<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the ball can be flipped away to the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
the ball can be flipped away to the
screen<00:01:40.290> half<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.620> quick<00:01:40.800> as<00:01:40.920> possible

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
screen half as quick as possible

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.160 
screen half as quick as possible
when<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.120> feel<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.540> scrimmage<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> steady

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
when I feel that the scrimmage is steady

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
when I feel that the scrimmage is steady
and<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.470> important<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.980> it<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.159> steady<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and it's important that it is steady and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
and it's important that it is steady and
let<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> feet<00:01:45.270> aren't<00:01:45.540> moving<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.440> it's

channel 1 ball is to get the ball away
quickly<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> back<00:02:40.140> movement

quickly so you can have a back movement
or<00:02:40.739> whatever<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.520> therefore<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.810> angle<00:02:43.020> of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
or whatever and therefore the angle of

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.410 
or whatever and therefore the angle of
strike<00:02:43.349> is<00:02:43.500> slightly<00:02:43.860> curtailed<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
strike is slightly curtailed and you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
strike is slightly curtailed and you
malas<00:02:45.720> clip<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> ball<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.160> sole<00:02:47.430> of

malas clip the ball with the sole of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.729 
malas clip the ball with the sole of
your<00:02:47.850> foot<00:02:48.150> where<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> wasn't<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.050> 2<00:02:49.260> ball<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.680> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
your foot where I wasn't a 2 ball it's a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.410 
your foot where I wasn't a 2 ball it's a
much<00:02:49.890> more<00:02:50.040> shelter<00:02:50.520> boy<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.910> slower<00:02:51.209> ball

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
much more shelter boy it's a slower ball

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
much more shelter boy it's a slower ball
it's<00:02:51.630> more<00:02:51.840> protected<00:02:52.350> ball<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.800> therefore

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
it's more protected ball and therefore

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.340 
it's more protected ball and therefore
it's<00:02:53.880> much<00:02:54.030> more<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.330> sweep<00:02:54.660> occasionally

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
it's much more of a sweep occasionally

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.600 
it's much more of a sweep occasionally
you'll<00:02:55.470> catch<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.769> ball<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.100> lower<00:02:56.280> part

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
you'll catch the ball and the lower part

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.509 
you'll catch the ball and the lower part
of<00:02:56.819> of<00:02:57.269> your<00:02:57.810> heel<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> boys<00:02:59.160> dragged

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
of of your heel and the boys dragged

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.130 
of of your heel and the boys dragged
around<00:02:59.790> through<00:03:00.120> channel<00:03:00.420> 2<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.870> number-8

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
around through channel 2 so the number-8

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.800 
around through channel 2 so the number-8
can<00:03:01.380> control<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> ball<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.880> he<00:03:03.360> sent<00:03:03.690> away

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
can control the ball and he sent away

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.900 
can control the ball and he sent away
from<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.590> right-hand<00:03:04.980> side<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.280> his<00:03:05.370> foot
