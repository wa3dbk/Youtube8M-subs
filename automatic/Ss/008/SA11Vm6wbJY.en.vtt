00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.719
 and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.459
 good welcome to our channel 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.290
 recipes today we're going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.140
 those of all life but is 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.660
 very easy to do and here aside that you 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.160
 it is very resultona that are the eggs 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.160
 stuffed to do the we're going to need 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.380
 then a few fresh eggs of the amount 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.390
 what you want depends on the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.710
 people that you have or if you are for one or 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.260
 two after mayonnaise also the one 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.559
 you use at home there is no requirement and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.750
 a can of tuna tuna can be 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.910
 in olive oil that is more good if 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.739
 not so in sunflower oil in 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.039
 first place we will start then putting 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.589
 what is a coffee with water to heat 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.629
 we want it to be boiling before 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.319
 put the eggs the eggs we have 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.980
 had out of the fridge because we 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.870
 Interested that they are not cold because 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.970
 if they were cold when we put 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.820
 in the hot water they can break us 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.010
 and they do not look pretty when we have the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 boiling water we will take the egg with 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.150
 very careful 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.979
 in water careful because when 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.979
 We can break it 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.990
 and let it boil for 10 minutes 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.370
 When the 10 minutes have passed 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.310
 we will take out the eggs 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.770
 of the saucepan and let them cool and a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 Once we have cooked we have it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.130
 by 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.290
 above the marble so that it's over 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.300
 to break up and we started it with cascarilla 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.300
 Carefully do not break 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.110
 husk everything once you already 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.390
 we have clean we will take the egg and with 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 Carefully, we'll break it in half 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 and now we will remove the part of the center and 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.870
 we will throw it to a bowl 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.700
 the white part will be reserved and 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.790
 we will put in the bowl what would be the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.420
 yolks and the can of tuna to the also 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.420
 drained 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.390
 and a couple of teaspoons of mayonnaise 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.080
 depending on the quantity if we see that 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.360
 we need more we take a little 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.970
 more than mayonnaise everything depends the quantity 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.640
 of eggs that we make and now what 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.450
 we will mix well starting what would be 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.270
 the egg yolks so that everything is 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.680
 well integrated we have to get a 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.680
 very homogeneous mixture 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.180
 ah 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.480
 and now we have two options or with 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.530
 this mixture that we already have put it in 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.030
 our eggs or else we're going to do the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.810
 step in we will do that is that what 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.480
 We crush to make it more homogeneous 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.400
 how little is it crushed right here 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.400
 with the blender or the blender 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.730
 what we will do until it looks good 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.730
 homogeneous a paste 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.840
 once we have the mixture already 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
 crushed and homogeneous we will put it in 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.190
 a pastry bag with a mouthpiece 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.270
 this curly we will take with a spatula 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.530
 our our cream and we'll put it on 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.530
 a pastry bag 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.120
 we already have our mixture in the sleeve 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.070
 pastry but as I said before 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.170
 we want this step we can skip it 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.810
 no problem what is the mixture 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.030
 once we have mixed it by hand the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.070
 we put inside the eggs and it would be 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.990
 perfect it would be great as well 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.850
 what happens that good as you will see 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.770
 will be much more presentable from this 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.670
 way now with with the mixture 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.639
 we will fill 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.919
 our eggs 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.919
 and as you can see 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.930
 many more beautiful so if I 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.930
 we did with the previous mix 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.370
 and we already have our eggs finished and 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.969
 as you can see here we have our 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.959
 eggs 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:05.599
 beautiful with a very nice curly and 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:08.149
 ready to taste you can see that they are very 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.429
 Easy to prepare are made in few 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:12.919
 minutes and they are perfect for any 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:15.169
