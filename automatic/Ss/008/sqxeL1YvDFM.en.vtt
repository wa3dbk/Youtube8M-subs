00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello friends welcome to area 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.850
 training from the avenue to the game 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.799
 of skill this time we will see the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.110
 centers is leveled by going to follow 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.450
 we will use my little friend philipp 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.460
 lahm who is a great great coach and is 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.869
 terrific for this exercise is very 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.699
 important that they use the triggers 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.519
 left of their controls for both 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.740
 throw as to center if I say to 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.840
 shoot high they will see why good here 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.230
 we started it is very important that the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.430
 centers direct them to whites 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.650
 successful but if the whites would say it 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.960
 is going to have a lot of possibility for the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.180
 white at the time of shooting is very 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.769
 important to give you since you will need it 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.530
 to complete all the points that are 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.299
 require to do this exercise 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.269
 they always have to center with the 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:53.059
 left trigger and must have a timing 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.909
 to hit the ball with the trigger 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.909
 left and the shot because when you 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.650
 volley hit is twice as many points 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.140
 gives double the positive to all three in 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.229
 a small pause I wait for myself instead of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.460
 I give my head with my leg with the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.650
 leg to give me double points 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.440
 in this case, it will also impact the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.470
 white and gave me many more all the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.180
 they have to direct their centers 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.920
 forward where the forwards go 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.960
 all the time where are the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.540
 front and if you can send the center 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.620
 towards whites since it's going to have 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.650
 a lot of possibility that when it comes to 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.040
 throw go to hit the target and put the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.260
 goal 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.790
 that's how they always have to treat the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.040
 white is very important in this 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 exercise because if they do not do it they will 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.930
 do a little before the center then 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.820
 nothing after and here the joke is that if 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.170
 it is important to give the whites if they do not 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.510
 can reach the amount of points that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 asks us to exercise all the time 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.890
 you have to be looking for the volleys the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.510
 golas all the time in this case it seems 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.310
 a ball but how it stopped with the chest 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.450
 does not give us double points 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.750
 if they see me wrong 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.219
 their moment when they usually throw 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.930
 the auctioneer stopping his 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.299
 skills to finish with the head 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.789
 possibly in this case our 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.410
 front is controls and the dance is a 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.720
 story that they always want for the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.260
 head all the time all the time the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.330
 that control well the moment to pull 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.160
 always always going to give the volley here 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.440
 we gave him very well and apart we gave the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.849
 white that generated points points 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.630
 important things that we need to finish 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.819
 with this exercise 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.090
 there we remeasured well and a 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.040
 double points always the center 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.360
 go ahead where the player is going look 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.519
 is what I say for example here 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.130
 we measure the center very well but more 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.290
 sweet as is a quality advice from 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.840
 head topped a little popcorn 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.269
 and we will do is a benefit points 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.700
 and a cross at the same time here 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.579
 We finished the volley very well the timing 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.750
 I repeat I repeat it is essential all the 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.870
 timing timing 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.510
 it is an exercise that is something that took them 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.910
 a little time grab the pace to 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.460
 to be able to do it but 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.770
 It really is not that complicated once 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.430
 that they grab the work I discovered that 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.120
 pointing towards the targets was very 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.370
 easy so much that they will finish volley as 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.040
 they hit the target because they also 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.750
 in this exercise the shot is manual like this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.550
 that if they do not control their shots well or 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.770
 they try to target the whites 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.800
 directly because they usually go to 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.510
 miss the shot because it is very sensitive to 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.790
 the placement then what I give them 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.340
 I recommend that you do not try to search 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.770
 the targets pulling but rather 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.510
 centering almost almost so that the cor 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.520
 comes to finish off the face to the whites 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.950
 all the time here again looking 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.290
 the whites and finishing off right and so 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.209
 we finished the exercise that was not 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.830
 eating time but we managed to do it 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:52.040
 I hope you liked this 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.040
