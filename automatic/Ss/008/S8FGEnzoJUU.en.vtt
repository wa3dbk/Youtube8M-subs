00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.730 
frequently so you might want to take
that<00:04:28.909> off<00:04:29.120> if<00:04:29.419> you<00:04:29.719> want<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.080> make<00:04:30.379> your<00:04:30.530> phone

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
that off if you want to make your phone

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.619 
that off if you want to make your phone
just<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.069> big<00:04:31.219> faster<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:32.499> move<00:04:33.499> that<00:04:34.629> the

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
just a big faster so move that the

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.809 
just a big faster so move that the
YouTube<00:04:35.960> app<00:04:36.139> now<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.620> may<00:04:37.099> use<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.400> YouTube

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
YouTube app now you may use a YouTube

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.059 
YouTube app now you may use a YouTube
app<00:04:38.029> but<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.539> wouldn't<00:04:39.050> suggest<00:04:39.259> it<00:04:39.620> because<00:04:39.949> it

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
app but I wouldn't suggest it because it

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.179 
app but I wouldn't suggest it because it
only<00:04:40.189> shows<00:04:40.400> one<00:04:40.639> video<00:04:40.909> at<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.120> time<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:42.189> it's

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:43.189 
only shows one video at a time and it's

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.110 
only shows one video at a time and it's
not<00:04:43.370> really<00:04:43.580> useful<00:04:43.759> because<00:04:44.289> sometimes<00:04:46.120> you

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
not really useful because sometimes you

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.279 
not really useful because sometimes you
don't<00:04:47.180> even<00:04:47.419> know<00:04:47.509> where<00:04:47.689> these<00:04:47.779> YouTube

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
don't even know where these YouTube

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.649 
don't even know where these YouTube
videos<00:04:48.529> come<00:04:48.740> from<00:04:48.949> so<00:04:49.159> you<00:04:49.219> just<00:04:49.550> remove<00:04:50.479> that

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
videos come from so you just remove that

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:58.029 
videos come from so you just remove that
one<00:04:50.810> too<00:04:50.960> if<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.199> want<00:04:52.210> remove<00:04:56.439> and<00:04:57.439> that's

one too if you want remove and that's

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.159 
one too if you want remove and that's
