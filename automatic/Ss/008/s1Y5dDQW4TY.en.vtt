00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.679 

I<00:00:15.460> think<00:00:16.460> most<00:00:16.670> people<00:00:16.880> have<00:00:17.000> no<00:00:17.150> idea<00:00:17.180> what<00:00:17.630> it

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
I think most people have no idea what it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.530 
I think most people have no idea what it
is<00:00:17.720> when<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.020> first<00:00:18.260> look<00:00:18.500> at<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:19.119> it<00:00:20.119> looks<00:00:20.180> like

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
is when I first look at it it looks like

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.970 
is when I first look at it it looks like
you<00:00:20.660> could<00:00:20.810> have<00:00:20.930> fallen<00:00:21.259> from<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.800> sky<00:00:23.980> we're

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
you could have fallen from the sky we're

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.080 
you could have fallen from the sky we're
trying<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.340> create<00:00:25.580> something<00:00:25.790> that<00:00:25.939> is

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
trying to create something that is

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.950 
trying to create something that is
unexpected<00:00:27.220> powerful<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.489> mysterious<00:00:31.960> it's

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
unexpected powerful and mysterious it's

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.400 
unexpected powerful and mysterious it's
this<00:00:33.260> living<00:00:34.250> alien<00:00:34.460> object<00:00:35.410> there's

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
this living alien object there's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.299 
this living alien object there's
something<00:00:36.800> inside<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:38.770> it<00:00:39.770> wants<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.160> get

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
something inside of it it wants to get

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:51.670 
something inside of it it wants to get
out

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.500 

there<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> point<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.220> time<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.820> consumer

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
there was a point in time where consumer

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.010 
there was a point in time where consumer
electronics<00:00:54.989> were<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> physical<00:00:55.649> thing<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
electronics were a physical thing a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.420 
electronics were a physical thing a
transistor<00:00:58.020> radio<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> cassette<00:00:59.070> player<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
transistor radio or a cassette player a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.130 
transistor radio or a cassette player a
Walkman<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.720> stereo<00:01:01.290> or<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> television<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
Walkman or a stereo or a television and

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.200 
Walkman or a stereo or a television and
then<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.710> software<00:01:05.100> element<00:01:05.550> of<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> became

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
then the software element of it became

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.460 
then the software element of it became
very<00:01:06.509> important<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.080> terms<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.410> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
very important in terms of the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
very important in terms of the
experience<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.540> we're

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
experience and now I think we're

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
experience and now I think we're
entering<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.170> era<00:01:10.440> where<00:01:11.100> consumer

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
entering this era where consumer

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
entering this era where consumer
electronics<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> hardware<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.170> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
get the soft part from the device to you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.850 
get the soft part from the device to you
now<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.569> you're<00:02:06.689> controlling<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.319> from<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
now that you're controlling it from a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.490 
now that you're controlling it from a
mobile<00:02:08.190> device<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:09.269> can<00:02:09.420> take<00:02:09.629> away<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.170> lot<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
mobile device we can take away a lot of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.300 
mobile device we can take away a lot of
those<00:02:10.619> elements<00:02:10.799> to<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:11.940> things<00:02:12.150> simpler

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
those elements to make things simpler

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.039 
those elements to make things simpler
people's<00:02:14.310> stereo<00:02:14.670> systems<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.660> were<00:02:15.780> very

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
people's stereo systems they were very

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.020 
people's stereo systems they were very
very<00:02:16.110> much<00:02:16.230> revered<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.280> when<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:17.849> to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
very much revered but when you're on to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.160 
very much revered but when you're on to
people's<00:02:18.269> houses<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.690> would<00:02:18.780> never<00:02:18.930> touch

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
people's houses you would never touch

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.559 
people's houses you would never touch
them<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.280> idea<00:02:20.579> here<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.000> people<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.450> be

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
them the idea here is that people can be

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.900 
them the idea here is that people can be
inquisitive<00:02:21.840> play<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.829> but<00:02:23.250> also<00:02:23.370> start

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
inquisitive play with it but also start

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.630 
inquisitive play with it but also start
using<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.269> interactively<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.230> got<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.069> kick<00:02:26.430> out

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
using it interactively I got a kick out

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.670 
using it interactively I got a kick out
of<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.739> sphere<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.470> as

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
of just that it's a sphere it's just as

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.759 
of just that it's a sphere it's just as
simple<00:02:32.099> as<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:35.840> when<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.870> think<00:02:37.170> about<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
simple as that when I think about the

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.800 
simple as that when I think about the
ways<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.459> enjoyed<00:02:38.819> music<00:02:39.360> when<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.660> was

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
ways that I enjoyed music when I was

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
ways that I enjoyed music when I was
younger<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.200> was<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.349> very<00:02:40.560> social<00:02:41.099> interaction

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
younger it was a very social interaction

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.289 
younger it was a very social interaction
