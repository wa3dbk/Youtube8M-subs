there are two major young and yin energy
vessels<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.560> meridians<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.880> first<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
vessels or meridians the first one is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.090 
vessels or meridians the first one is
called<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.840> governing<00:00:34.350> vessel<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.829> runs

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
called the governing vessel which runs

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
called the governing vessel which runs
up<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.760> spine<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.420> over<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> crown<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
up the spine and over the crown of the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.069 
up the spine and over the crown of the
head<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.250> second<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> called<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.329> conception

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
head the second is called the conception

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
head the second is called the conception
vessel<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.860> yin<00:00:41.100> Meridian<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
vessel which is the yin Meridian that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
vessel which is the yin Meridian that
runs<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> front<00:00:42.809> midline<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.739> body

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
runs down the front midline of the body

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
runs down the front midline of the body
so<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> wellness<00:00:45.420> treatment<00:00:45.890> balances<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
so this wellness treatment balances the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.119 
so this wellness treatment balances the
energy<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.090> young<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> Yin<00:00:49.440> especially

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
energy of the young and Yin especially

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the governing and conception vessel and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770 
the governing and conception vessel and
it<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.649> treats<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> balances<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.120> energy

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it also treats and balances the energy
