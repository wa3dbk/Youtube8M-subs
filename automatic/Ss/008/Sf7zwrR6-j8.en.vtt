a<00:01:02.550> question<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.120> putting<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.480> enough

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a question of them putting in enough

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.000 
a question of them putting in enough
effort<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> step<00:01:04.680> back<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
effort because when you step back and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
effort because when you step back and
look<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.220> these<00:01:05.369> songs<00:01:05.640> only<00:01:05.850> from<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> musical

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
look at these songs only from a musical

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
look at these songs only from a musical
perspective<00:01:07.320> they're<00:01:07.560> very<00:01:07.830> well-crafted

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
perspective they're very well-crafted

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
perspective they're very well-crafted
and<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.060> clear<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> band<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> one

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and it's also clear that the band is one

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
and it's also clear that the band is one
hundred<00:01:10.380> percent<00:01:10.590> into<00:01:11.130> playing<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.580> they

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
hundred percent into playing them they

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.859 
hundred percent into playing them they
just<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.299> punch<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
just don't have that punch that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
just don't have that punch that
electricity<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.770> makes<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.250> band<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
electricity that makes that band so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
electricity that makes that band so
great<00:01:15.090> sure<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.110> super<00:01:16.500> fast

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
great sure they have these super fast

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
great sure they have these super fast
drum<00:01:17.130> breaks<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.850> throughout

drum breaks here and there throughout

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
drum breaks here and there throughout
the<00:01:18.360> songs<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.900> when<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.170> shift<00:01:19.439> back<00:01:19.619> into

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the songs but when they shift back into

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
the songs but when they shift back into
the<00:01:19.950> core<00:01:20.130> tempo<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> songs<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.030> dig<00:01:21.270> deep

the core tempo on songs like dig deep

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
the core tempo on songs like dig deep

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
singles on this album because they're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.350 
singles on this album because they're
probably<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> two<00:01:59.369> strongest<00:01:59.610> tracks<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> in

terms of tempo in tone they're not
representative<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> rest<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> record

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
representative of the rest of the record

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.910 
representative of the rest of the record
I<00:02:03.810> mean<00:02:03.960> once<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> listen<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> these<00:02:04.680> two

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
I mean once you listen to these two

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.530 
I mean once you listen to these two
songs<00:02:05.159> compared<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> rest<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> record

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
songs compared to the rest of the record

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
songs compared to the rest of the record
it's<00:02:06.719> very<00:02:07.110> obvious<00:02:07.680> how<00:02:07.829> subpar<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> rest<00:02:08.819> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it's very obvious how subpar the rest of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.520 
it's very obvious how subpar the rest of
those<00:02:09.060> songs<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.629> I'm<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.050> sure<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.410> is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
those songs are I'm not sure what it is

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.199 
those songs are I'm not sure what it is
maybe<00:02:10.830> their<00:02:11.039> extensive<00:02:11.489> absence<00:02:11.940> from<00:02:12.060> New

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
maybe their extensive absence from New

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.050 
maybe their extensive absence from New
York<00:02:12.360> City<00:02:12.569> has

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
York City has

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.460 
York City has
been<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.480> too<00:02:13.660> much<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.140> maybe<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.440> just

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
been up too much and maybe they just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.080 
been up too much and maybe they just
didn't<00:02:14.860> realize<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.430> bite<00:02:15.640> their<00:02:15.849> songs

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
didn't realize that the bite their songs

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.420 
didn't realize that the bite their songs
almost<00:02:16.270> always<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.959> just<00:02:17.470> wasn't<00:02:17.890> there<00:02:18.069> but

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
almost always have just wasn't there but

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.920 
almost always have just wasn't there but
any<00:02:18.670> way<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:18.880> slice<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.239> there's<00:02:19.599> clearly

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
any way you slice it there's clearly

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.839 
any way you slice it there's clearly
something<00:02:20.319> very<00:02:20.739> big<00:02:21.010> missing<00:02:21.550> from<00:02:21.730> this

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
something very big missing from this

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.640 
something very big missing from this
record<00:02:22.270> whatever<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.900> something<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.380> have

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
record whatever that something is I have

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.870 
record whatever that something is I have
to<00:02:23.770> think<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.130> once<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:24.640> into<00:02:24.819> their

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
to think that once they get into their

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.250 
to think that once they get into their
current<00:02:25.270> tour<00:02:25.480> they're<00:02:25.660> going<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> see<00:02:26.080> how

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
current tour they're going to see how

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.990 
current tour they're going to see how
much<00:02:26.410> these<00:02:26.650> songs<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.220> kill<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.580> energy<00:02:27.910> of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
much these songs just kill the energy of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.550 
much these songs just kill the energy of
the<00:02:28.120> crowd<00:02:28.239> they're<00:02:28.690> gonna<00:02:28.780> slowly<00:02:29.140> remove

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
the crowd they're gonna slowly remove

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.990 
the crowd they're gonna slowly remove
them<00:02:29.739> from<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.010> set<00:02:30.220> because<00:02:30.459> they<00:02:30.700> just

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
them from the set because they just

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.490 
them from the set because they just
don't<00:02:31.180> measure<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.720> anything<00:02:32.230> else

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
don't measure up to anything else

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.930 
don't measure up to anything else
they've<00:02:32.739> done<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> being

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
they've done but with all of that being

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150 
they've done but with all of that being
said<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.450> will<00:02:34.720> still<00:02:34.959> recommend<00:02:35.530> as<00:02:35.709> strongly
