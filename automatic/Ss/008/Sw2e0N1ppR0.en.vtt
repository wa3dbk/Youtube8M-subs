00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.320
 the first recipe is a fried egg 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.440
 but fried we leave immediately then I will 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.750
 frying hot oil 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 then listen to me well peanut oil 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.859
 to fry and I recommend it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 let's break place gently do 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.279
 you will do because the sea is cheating here 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.539
 I let it fall into a small bowl if it is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.160
 make yourself at home if you re fi 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.960
 I recommend one at a time why 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.880
 very dangerous jokes a troubled one 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.579
 whole egg threw a new afflicted 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.379
 so for me it is important that the level 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 the oil is not very high must 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.629
 be two fingers with the theme so not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.640
 they explode could happen then it is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.879
 it simply lets itself slip into 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.219
 bottom and create this there is another 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.079
 egg recipe we are egg clutch bag and yes 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.090
 do in the water then throw an egg in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 boiling water with vinegar 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.219
 the album is immediately in album and the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.409
 white is set up this is created 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.670
 outer shell here instead the shell will be 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.960
 crunchy then you saw it again 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 of the anchovies if I want to do for 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.890
 then complete a sauce of anchovies men 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 we usually do very well together 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.299
 yes very much to make the anchovy sauce 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.189
 I take a piece of butter in the thirty 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.710
 I do linen simultaneously but not you 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 shoot help this i kept so much we are 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 see how we are 160 we put a little 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.130
 of friends inside me let melt in 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.549
 sweet fire 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:51.060
 meanwhile let visa slip 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.540
 how a person is just turning wood 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.610
 see the white is already recovering and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.610
 you make me some kind of debussy 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 if I would have thrown it out loud and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.950
 risks, that is, I take the child into account 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.259
 you have a baby so i have a b movie 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.110
 this recipe is spectacular for i 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.310
 children but like and cook for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.569
 to cook 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.720
 the first few times to do that with him 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.400
 water that is a little simpler and later 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.190
 if you like crispy fried food 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.930
 look how wonderful that less livable 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.030
 remember that frying is needed 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.830
 always plenty of paper to dry the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.810
 nice of this about this thing 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.060
 the man inside must remain a quarrel 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.819
 yolk for which it is enough to create this 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.610
 external crust is very fast 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.569
 as times the fireplace lets it slip 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.970
 on paper and we keep it warm here 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.900
 I'm interested it's melting 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 I had a natural whip or a fire 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.959
 here it is to turn it off maybe the heart and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.720
 I add a little more butter 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.870
 because I left it and then touched it 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.250
 magic always with butter and anchovy 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.799
 roasted hazelnuts are very good 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.569
 here we are already facing, or the 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:16.370
 you can find the quantity I didn't find 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:18.350
 inside I go very well if you don't like it 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.299
 the too strong taste of the anchovy you can 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.320
 add a little bit of milk liter 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.910
 I had taken a new home instead 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:33.220
 we found it again 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:39.650
 wait wait wait for the famous finger 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.049
 even a little bit with you will see that with col 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.819
 our fried the house will be one 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.760
 wonder we lower the flame here 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.440
 then the egg we have the ce sauce 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.440
 we have it, I would say that the first course 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.620
 I can even serve you long 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:00.620
 and nose the spoon uses a spoon 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:06.140
 so to put it on the plate 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:12.140
 then another secret heel and then 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.580
 inside still we count it with liquid 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.049
 anchovy sauce if you really want 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.220
 exaggerate, I went to mine 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:21.650
 this magic box from the old house 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.100
 watch them I bought on a trip that 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.740
 I made the cake rises to between 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:32.360
 two holy wars so it does not give them some 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.800
 of tastes or a little later we still are 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.090
 actually if it was n't a salt they have 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:42.710
 flavored with the forward 3 so that a 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:45.560
 so we drop it or then one 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.400
 beautiful anchovy casting then 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.470
 very little will be the caviar if you are 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.780
 taking into getting a plate is ready you 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.160
 you never brought a drink is not 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.229
 tasted so I didn't come for 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.479
 work and I didn't knock because the 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.630
 door was open so then 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:11.960
 we have to do the test if really 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:14.780
 leaking we steal go to the nearby taste 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.849
 and that luck is with us or with yes 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.840
 correct but I would say then we do then 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.560
 I'm going to get the wine, let's take a 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.560
 toast for the kitchen
