00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
pull them and then you can spray roundup

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.649 
pull them and then you can spray roundup
to<00:01:26.549> keep<00:01:26.759> them<00:01:26.970> from<00:01:27.119> coming<00:01:27.450> back<00:01:29.450> okay<00:01:30.450> now

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to keep them from coming back okay now

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
to keep them from coming back okay now
