00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.080
 3,500 people die on the asphalt 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.330
 daily in the whole world product 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.250
 of a traffic accident according to the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.970
 world health organization is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 say a million 240 thousand people lose 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.820
 life every year and 50 million result 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.640
 wounds the efforts to raise awareness 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.489
 the population seem insufficient to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.890
 despite multiple campaigns like these 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.320
 every minute two people lose their lives 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.120
 in the days if only I would have expected 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.290
 a little more to say goodbye to the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.360
 people that I wanted 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.000
 lose a loved one for these 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.150
 circumstances is christian says a 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.550
 trauma impossible to overcome thousandths of 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.030
 second changes in thousandths of a second 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.280
 I still feel 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.829
 and I still remember the last kiss I gave him 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.379
 being well as around 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.199
 24,000 traffic accidents are 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.380
 register annually in our country the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.119
 fact of traffic accidents are 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.340
 28,169 that we have in the databases 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.210
 of the national transit agency with 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.790
 a number of deaths of two thousand 277 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.280
 However, according to Guillermo Abad, 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.649
 number is much higher because it does not 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.840
 all accidents that occur in 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.119
 the tracks are registered in a part 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.759
 police we have the official data that 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.140
 is addressing the 3,000 people 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.440
 deceased per year and we have the data 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 real that is the cumulative of different 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.940
 institutions and that is bordering the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.770
 five the five thousand people per year a 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.750
 registered traffic accident is 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.970
 tomorrow in removed two dead and three 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.460
 injured left every day news 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.979
 how are you flooding the news of the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.800
 the greatest cause of accidents in 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.899
 the ways is the speeding and the 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.270
 recklessness of drivers that many times 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.790
 and respect the law we visit the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 911 facilities 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.130
 where 272 cameras daily 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.869
 they record these mishaps in more than 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.150
 half of the people who perish in 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.310
 accidents did not even travel in 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.150
 that is, they were pedestrians 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.610
 cyclists or motorcyclists for example in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.830
 this image we can see how in the south 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.890
 from the capital a person who crosses the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.770
 street is hit by not going through a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.110
 pedestrian crossing or this motorcycle that 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.120
 fly after the impact of a vehicle in 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.840
 avenida diego de vásquez north of 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.270
 quito 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.970
 this is the impact between a taxi and a 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 car without noticing any of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.120
 both 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.400
 which is the main street crossed to 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.590
 very high speed 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.650
 since the creation of the integrated service 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.439
 of security with 911 its director caesar 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.659
 navas affirms that 10 percent of the 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.879
 calls received in the call center are 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.890
 for a traffic accident and that the 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.900
 work intensifies the purposes of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.170
 week on the weekend are our 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.930
 peak work days are the days where 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.930
 the percentage of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.879
 emergencies that we serve almost 25 per 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.470
 percent of normal demand is not 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.920
 find near the person flour 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.150
 true at this time we have had a 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.060
 growth not in accidents but yes 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.799
 in the impact of accidents and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.269
 accidents have decreased but the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.489
 impact that these accidents have had 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.889
 it has increased in a transport 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.379
 public a sinister passenger in 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.139
 highway is coming back more than 15 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.359
 victims between dead and injured every 18 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.609
 days will be a loss of magnitude 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.889
 traffic accidents are the eighth 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.870
 cause of death in the world and if you do not 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.389
 take urgent measures could be 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.090
 become the fifth fatal cause for 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.859
 the 2030 darío tapia director of the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.349
 metropolitan transit agency 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.510
 Quito tells us that in the capital the 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.669
 peripheral lines have become 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.459
 fatal scenarios accidents in 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:05.480
 Simón Bolívar are already surpassing 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:10.310
 the 45 daily and the deceased the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.340
 average height about 5 deceased per 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.650
 every week to know these alarming 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.320
 figures controls were retaken 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.120
 speeding vehicle for 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.799
 these operatives the agency 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.840
 metropolitan transit of quito 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.910
 has new photos 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.960
 of more advanced technology to the ass 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.180
 vehicle to the black river at 200 kilometers 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.220
 per hour these devices can measure 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.070
 the speed both in the day and in the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.600
 night and even with haze the radars 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.720
 they can be used from the same 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.639
 patrols for more efficient control 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.280
 these are the speed limits that 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.010
 you can not overcome the vehicles 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.860
 light can not circulate more than 50 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.199
 kilometers per hour in urban areas 90 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.639
 in perimeter zones and 100 kilometers 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.490
 per hour on the road 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.500
 if you drive over 50 and it arrives 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.280
 up to 60 kilometers per hour in the 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.729
 90 and 120 in perimeter areas and 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.639
 between 100 and 135 kilometers per hour in 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.950
 roads you will be exceeding the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.340
 moderate range and you will have to pay a 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.650
 fine of $ 102 and you will have 6 points 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.630
 less in the license but if it exceeds 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.150
 these limits the penalty will be 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.990
 considered excessive so it will have 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.969
 that paying $ 430 will lose 10 points 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.429
 of his license and he will go to jail 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.009
 while public transport does not 

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:37.769
 you must go from 40 kilometers per 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.259
 hour in urban areas 70 in the area 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:42.299
 perimeter and 90 kilometers per hour in 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.279
 roads we accompany several 

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:46.409
 of the metropolitan agency of 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.659
 transit to the Algerian sector 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.149
 south of the capital on Simón Avenue 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.489
 bolivar to perform these controls 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.089
 when a vehicle exceeds the limits of 

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:56.009
 speed 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.259
 the radar captures a photograph of 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.329
 offender so that agents alert 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.819
 his colleagues who have mounted a 

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:05.500
 operative later on where they impart the 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.930
 respective penalty 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.080
 the average we have to have one of 70 80 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.190
 vehicles already cited speed 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.260
 average has been in the vehicles 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.090
 light from 98 to 115 120 kilometers of 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.400
 been the average first we did not abuse 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.110
 the vehicles that we have to 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.840
 families are waiting for us at home and what 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.880
 there is always time for everything 5 to 10 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.980
 minutes do not complicate our lives 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.870
 heads of jobs or someone we 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.670
 You can wait a little longer with the 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.980
 new radars and multiple controls 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.750
 of speed is expected to decrease the 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.360
 number of accidents that occur 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.850
 on the tracks and thereby save thousands of 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.400
 lives of innocent people who die 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.350
 in the hands of irresponsible drivers without 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.660
 However, as long as no 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.360
 true road awareness and all 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.250
 let's understand the fragility of life and what 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.380
 easy that is to lose it by acts 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.000
 irresponsible on the road the 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.340
 traffic accidents 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.550
 they will continue to destroy thousands of families
