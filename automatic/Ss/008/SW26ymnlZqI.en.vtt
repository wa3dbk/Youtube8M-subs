00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 hi guys this adriana villela 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 I 'm here to give you a quick hint of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.719
 how to write aiming glasses to make 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.309
 canned jams 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 so we have here I have here 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 all the glass or sterilize and a 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 pan, it is important that the pan is 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 higher than my votes because 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 they need to be completely 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.550
 immersed in water 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 if you do not have a pan so high 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can let them lie down your 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 hair - pots in pan 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.149
 I do not have the glass pots here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.840
 already filled with water I'll put it here 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.300
 deep in that pan 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 the covers well go all in there them 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.579
 also need to be sterilized and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.640
 now I will cover it with water until they 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.199
 100% semester 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 It's important that you do this. 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 procedure in this way with the pan 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 cold the cold pots and water also brake 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
 and if you happen to put hot water 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.109
 here their ports are at risk of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.059
 to burst 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.739
 they are glass now we take 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.720
 this here to the fire 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.850
 when I picked it up when it opened 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.170
 start boiling we count 15 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.170
 minutes and withdraws 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.719
 after 15 minutes boiling 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.829
 We'll get you out of here with tweezers. 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.829
 and very careful 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:39.750
 I'll put it on a dishcloth 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.750
 very clean turned upside down 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.439
 they did not have you now have your glasses 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.479
 and interviewees ' caps 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.369
 but remember to do this a little 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.539
 before you use it if you do it on 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.220
