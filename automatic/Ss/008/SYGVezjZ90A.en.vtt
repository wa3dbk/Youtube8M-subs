 doing now let's start I'll start 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.630
 by painting full line with a color 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.730
 blue in a low tone 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.400
 now over the area below my nail 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.530
 I will be adding green glaze and 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.080
 with a makeup sponge I'm going to 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 start with pure pats to 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.850
 spreading the green color 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.400
 now I'm going to apply white enamel 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.410
 directly to my makeup sponge 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.320
 and pure pat I'll start 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 Sponge the top of my nail 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 This is the brand and measure of brush that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.340
 I will be using to paint my 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.350
 zacatito and that's what the little tip looks like 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.210
 using this brush with paint 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.120
 acrylic in green in a tone 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.980
 shortly I'll be doing limits 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.810
 going from the bottom up I'm going to do 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.520
 exactly the same thing but now with 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.770
 a dark green color 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.420
 This is the brand and measure of brush that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.280
 I will be using to paint my 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.180
 flowers 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 and that's what the little tip looks like 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.260
 towards the side of my moon I'm going to start 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.180
 dots 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.730
 I will be painting two little flowers 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.470

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.270
 I will be doing exactly the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.980
 same thing but now my little flowers go 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.810

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.819
 now using my brush I will be 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.370
 the wings of my butterfly with a color 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.930

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.370
 this step is optional 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.530
 what is delineated in black now is 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.090
 time to add white dots but 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.090
 this step is also optional 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.260
 and that's it for this design apply 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.880

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.150
 move to the design that I have about me 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.770
 nail of my ring finger I started this design 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.990
 in the same way as we started the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.050

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.640
 side of my nail I'll be painting the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.350
 trunk of my tree with a brown color and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.360
 I'm painting it going to the side 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.730
 towards the top I'm going to start 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.730
 paint my branches also in brown 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.640
 This is the mark and measure of the brush that 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.500
 I will be using to paint the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.329
 green leaves of my tree 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.370
 I'm going to be dipping my brush in a 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.819
 green color in a low tone and in a 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.159
 highest tone half and half now with 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.560

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.290
 my brush and behind are going to be both 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.180
 shades in green color is a very 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.180
 easy to paint green leaves 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.880
 now using a black color I'm going to 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.440
 make a circle this is going to be our 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.440
 swing made of a rim 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.330
 now using a beige color I'm going to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.200
 make a line connecting the part of 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.110
 up the rim to the tree branch 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
 now it's time to add the shoe 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.650

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.650

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.170
 I'm going to do exactly the same thing 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.950
 but now with a green color in a tone 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.950

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.510
 little white flowers of five dots 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.580

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.370
 a little yellow flower of five dots 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.140
