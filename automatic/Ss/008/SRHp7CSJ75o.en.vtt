it

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.990 
it
we'll<00:00:07.859> start<00:00:08.069> by<00:00:08.220> moving<00:00:08.429> all<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> way<00:00:08.790> left

we'll start by moving all the way left

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.419 
we'll start by moving all the way left
and<00:00:09.300> then<00:00:09.840> while<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.860> haven't<00:00:11.010> found<00:00:11.219> what

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
and then while we haven't found what

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.039 
and then while we haven't found what
we're<00:00:11.550> looking<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.820> if<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.750> piece<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.019> are

looking at is blue you'll need to keep

piece to the right is blue
you<00:00:20.490> should<00:00:20.640> stop<00:00:20.850> because<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> found<00:00:21.390> it

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980

else if the piece to the right is yellow

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.670 
else if the piece to the right is yellow
move<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> space<00:00:26.070> right<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:27.380> think<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> good

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
move a space right I think it's a good

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.279 
move a space right I think it's a good
way<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.859> start<00:00:29.189> by<00:00:29.460> moving<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> way<00:00:30.060> left

way to start by moving all the way left

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.510 
way to start by moving all the way left
because<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.320> means<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.830> first<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.279> we

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
because that means the first time we

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790 
because that means the first time we
find<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.940> yellow<00:00:33.149> followed<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> blue<00:00:34.050> that'll

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
find a yellow followed by a blue that'll

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.930 
find a yellow followed by a blue that'll
be<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> leftmost<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:37.160> now<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.399> long<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.700> we

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
be the leftmost one now as long as we

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.190 
be the leftmost one now as long as we
haven't<00:00:39.120> found<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> keep

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
haven't found it we're going to keep

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.220 
haven't found it we're going to keep
looking<00:00:40.850> while<00:00:41.850> we're<00:00:42.030> looking<00:00:42.120> if<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.050> piece

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
looking while we're looking if the piece

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
looking while we're looking if the piece
you're<00:00:43.350> looking<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> blue<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.610> right

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you're looking at is blue like right

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
you're looking at is blue like right
here<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:46.410> means<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.829> haven't<00:00:46.980> found

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
here that means that we haven't found

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
here that means that we haven't found
what<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.489> looking<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.789> yet<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.870> should

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
what we're looking for yet and we should

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.610 
what we're looking for yet and we should
move<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.289> space<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:50.149> otherwise<00:00:51.620> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
move one space right otherwise that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900 
move one space right otherwise that
means<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.100> piece<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.489> looking<00:00:53.789> at

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
means the piece that you're looking at

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.500 
means the piece that you're looking at
is<00:00:54.090> yellow<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.699> if<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is yellow and if the one to the right of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
is yellow and if the one to the right of
it<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> blue<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.680> were<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:58.949> here

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it is blue so if we were right here

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
it is blue so if we were right here
we're<00:00:59.609> looking<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> yellow<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we're looking at a yellow the one to the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
we're looking at a yellow the one to the
right<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.020> blue<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:02.250> would<00:01:02.370> stop<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
right is blue you would stop because you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.420 
right is blue you would stop because you
found<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.799> but<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.890> you're<00:01:05.010> looking<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
found it but if you're looking at a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
found it but if you're looking at a
yellow<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> piece<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
yellow and the piece to the right is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
yellow and the piece to the right is
also<00:01:07.409> yellow<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:08.310> haven't<00:01:08.520> found<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.820> we're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
also yellow we haven't found what we're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.130 
also yellow we haven't found what we're
looking<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.630> need<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> keep<00:01:09.960> moving

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
looking for and we need to keep moving

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.560 
looking for and we need to keep moving
so<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> case<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.939> still<00:01:12.119> move<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> space

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so in that case we still move a space

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
so in that case we still move a space
right<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:15.000> work<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
right so the way that this would work on

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
right so the way that this would work on
this<00:01:15.689> input<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.009> start<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> way

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
this input is we would start all the way

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.480 
this input is we would start all the way
to<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.090> left<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.890> we<00:01:19.890> haven't<00:01:20.159> found<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.430> yet

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to the left and we haven't found it yet

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.760 
to the left and we haven't found it yet
so<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.630> look<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> piece<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.500> blue

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so we would look at the piece it's blue

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.580 
so we would look at the piece it's blue
so<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.310> move<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:24.080> we<00:01:25.080> still<00:01:25.229> haven't<00:01:25.439> found

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so we move right we still haven't found

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399 
so we move right we still haven't found
it<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.369> look<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.700> piece<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.240> blue<00:01:27.600> so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it so we look at this piece it's blue so

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.740 
it so we look at this piece it's blue so
we<00:01:28.530> move<00:01:28.680> right<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:30.090> still<00:01:30.270> haven't<00:01:30.450> found<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
we move right we still haven't found it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.929 
we move right we still haven't found it
so<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.110> look<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> piece<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.100> blue<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.820> we

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
so we look at this piece it's blue so we

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.410
