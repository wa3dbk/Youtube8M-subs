cabinets I wanted it just to use my full
length<00:02:53.310> cabinets<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.909> what<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.030> did<00:02:54.329> was<00:02:54.810> on

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
length cabinets and what I did was on

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.189 
length cabinets and what I did was on
this<00:02:55.109> right<00:02:55.379> here<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.969> squared<00:02:56.969> the<00:02:57.659> face<00:02:57.900> of

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:58.199 
this right here I squared the face of

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.709 
this right here I squared the face of
this<00:02:58.319> cabinet<00:02:59.099> all<00:02:59.219> the<00:02:59.340> way<00:02:59.459> down<00:02:59.669> and<00:02:59.969> then<00:03:00.689> I

this cabinet all the way down and then I

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.699 
this cabinet all the way down and then I
ran<00:03:01.049> my<00:03:01.319> mark<00:03:01.829> squaring<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> back

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
ran my mark squaring it to the back

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.619 
ran my mark squaring it to the back
squared<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.889> down<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.219> back<00:03:05.400> also<00:03:06.389> all<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
squared it down the back also all the

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.360 
squared it down the back also all the
way<00:03:06.719> down<00:03:06.930> drew<00:03:07.169> me<00:03:07.319> aligned<00:03:07.590> took<00:03:08.250> my

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
way down drew me aligned took my

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.149 
way down drew me aligned took my
circular<00:03:08.879> saw<00:03:09.169> come<00:03:10.169> here<00:03:10.409> well<00:03:10.680> first<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:11.040> went

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
circular saw come here well first I went

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.159 
circular saw come here well first I went
on<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> back<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.150> cut<00:03:12.540> straight<00:03:12.780> down<00:03:13.019> the

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
on the back and I cut straight down the

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.229 
on the back and I cut straight down the
line<00:03:13.349> as<00:03:13.799> deep<00:03:14.069> as<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> saw<00:03:14.609> blade<00:03:14.879> would<00:03:15.060> go

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
line as deep as the saw blade would go

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.750 
line as deep as the saw blade would go
all<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.930> way<00:03:16.169> to<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.469> bottom<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.010> then<00:03:17.669> I

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
all the way to the bottom and then I

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.849 
all the way to the bottom and then I
come<00:03:17.969> over<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.449> on<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.629> front<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.590> I've

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
come over here on the front and I've

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.199 
come over here on the front and I've
done<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.099> same<00:03:20.219> thing<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.699> had<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:21.000> basically

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
done the same thing I had to basically

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.780 
done the same thing I had to basically
just<00:03:21.629> cut<00:03:21.810> through<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.139> board<00:03:22.409> here<00:03:22.859> right

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
just cut through this board here right

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.789 
just cut through this board here right
install<00:03:24.120> down<00:03:24.509> through<00:03:25.109> this<00:03:25.259> area<00:03:25.530> right

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
install down through this area right

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.929 
install down through this area right
here<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.720> then<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.870> put<00:03:28.049> my<00:03:28.079> sawzall<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.009> just

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
here and then I put my sawzall and just

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.140 
here and then I put my sawzall and just
kind<00:03:30.689> of<00:03:30.720> roughly<00:03:31.109> cut<00:03:32.009> the<00:03:32.250> shelving<00:03:32.790> boards

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
kind of roughly cut the shelving boards

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.599 
kind of roughly cut the shelving boards
off<00:03:33.299> okay<00:03:33.659> they're<00:03:34.169> not<00:03:34.319> perfect<00:03:34.859> don't

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
off okay they're not perfect don't

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.129 
off okay they're not perfect don't
really<00:03:35.909> need<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.419> biggest<00:03:36.870> thing<00:03:37.019> I
