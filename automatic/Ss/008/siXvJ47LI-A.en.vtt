outside of the the bug jim i believe if

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.890 
outside of the the bug jim i believe if
i'm<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.430> mistaken<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.150> we're<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.689> side<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
i'm not mistaken so we're just a side of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.140 
i'm not mistaken so we're just a side of
it<00:00:25.109> maybe<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.650> take<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> look<00:00:25.859> around<00:00:26.150> maybe

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it maybe we can take a look around maybe

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.730 
it maybe we can take a look around maybe
oh<00:00:27.390> wait<00:00:27.689> no<00:00:27.869> we're<00:00:28.080> actually<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.380> needed<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
oh wait no we're actually just needed a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.550 
oh wait no we're actually just needed a
normal<00:00:29.160> place<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:30.210> yeah<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.470> on

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370 
normal place to but yeah so we we get on
average<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> three<00:00:32.430> um<00:00:33.260> two<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
average about two to three um two to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
average about two to three um two to
three<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:35.130> did<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:35.280> call<00:00:35.399> raw<00:00:35.610> fish<00:00:35.910> per

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
kill so that is insane if we can keep up

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
kill so that is insane if we can keep up
that<00:00:39.149> kind<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> grinding<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> the

how did that torch get there yeah so
we're<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.820> try<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.119> ourselves<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.450> stack

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
we're gonna try to get ourselves a stack

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
we're gonna try to get ourselves a stack
probably<00:01:46.350> bring<00:01:47.189> try<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> give<00:01:47.520> ourselves<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
probably bring try to give ourselves a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510 
probably bring try to give ourselves a
stack<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.750> raw<00:01:49.680> fish<00:01:49.950> they'll<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.250> probably

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
stack of a raw fish they'll be probably

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.380 
stack of a raw fish they'll be probably
really<00:01:50.850> good

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
really good

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
um we're gonna get rid of this so we can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.740 
um we're gonna get rid of this so we can
actually<00:01:53.400> make<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:53.940> anyways<00:01:54.330> so<00:01:54.540> there's<00:01:54.659> no

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
actually make it anyways so there's no

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
actually make it anyways so there's no
point<00:01:54.900> keeping<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.350> around<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.190> look<00:01:56.370> at<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
point keeping it around but look at that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.750 
point keeping it around but look at that
look<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.030> all<00:01:57.150> these<00:01:57.240> people<00:01:57.479> oh<00:01:57.870> my<00:01:58.500> gosh

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
look at all these people oh my gosh

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.910 
look at all these people oh my gosh
let's<00:01:59.760> count<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.150> 590<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> slope

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
let's count it out 590 this is slope

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.070 
let's count it out 590 this is slope
there<00:02:02.220> there's<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.210> jig<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.930> see

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
there there's a thing of a jig and see

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.210 
there there's a thing of a jig and see
if<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.260> can<00:02:04.350> get<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> same<00:02:04.650> luck<00:02:04.860> hopefully<00:02:05.040> we

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
if we can get the same luck hopefully we

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.590 
if we can get the same luck hopefully we
won't<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.490> good<00:02:05.580> moveset<00:02:05.790> either<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.510> we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
won't have a good moveset either so we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
won't have a good moveset either so we
can<00:02:06.720> actually<00:02:06.869> take<00:02:07.170> him<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.500> get<00:02:08.039> some<00:02:08.190> good

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can actually take him out get some good

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.510 
can actually take him out get some good
levels<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.850> good<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:10.400> okay<00:02:11.400> actually

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
levels and be good to go okay actually

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.770 
levels and be good to go okay actually
now<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.450> let's<00:02:12.630> switch

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
now that I think about it let's switch

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.960 
now that I think about it let's switch
over<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.320> Magikarp<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:13.980> good<00:02:14.100> get<00:02:14.940> some

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
over so Magikarp get some good get some

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.430 
over so Magikarp get some good get some
good<00:02:15.150> levels<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.990> we<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.410> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
good levels if that is we can take it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.510 
good levels if that is we can take it
out<00:02:16.620> mark<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> cart<00:02:18.590> nope<00:02:19.590> he<00:02:19.920> has<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> an

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
out mark to cart nope he has a an

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.040 
out mark to cart nope he has a an
offensive<00:02:20.940> move<00:02:21.000> maybe<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.630> won't<00:02:21.750> work<00:02:21.840> out

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
offensive move maybe this won't work out

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.260 
offensive move maybe this won't work out
as<00:02:22.230> well<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.530> thought<00:02:22.910> we'll<00:02:23.910> give<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> go

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
as well as I thought we'll give it a go

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.449 
as well as I thought we'll give it a go
though<00:02:25.280> come<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:27.709> okay<00:02:28.709> this<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.100> gonna<00:02:29.250> be<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
though come on okay this is gonna be a

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.600 
though come on okay this is gonna be a
