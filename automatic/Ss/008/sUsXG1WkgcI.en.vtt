00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
and that way we can work in there

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.000 
and that way we can work in there
comfortably<00:00:47.510> getting<00:00:48.200> extra<00:00:48.500> hands<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.800> help

the<00:00:51.230> front<00:00:51.500> clip<00:00:51.680> will<00:00:51.830> need<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.070> come<00:00:52.220> off<00:00:52.370> and

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
the front clip will need to come off and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.790 
the front clip will need to come off and
on<00:00:52.670> several<00:00:52.940> times<00:00:53.210> during<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.690> build<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.530> find

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
on several times during a build we find

offering free lunches seems to attract a
large<00:00:56.780> enough<00:00:57.020> crowd<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:57.950> we<00:00:58.070> got<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.370> engine

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
large enough crowd so we got the engine

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.310 
large enough crowd so we got the engine
and<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> tranny<00:00:59.120> mated<00:00:59.510> together<00:00:59.630> and<00:01:00.050> we<00:01:00.170> got

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and the tranny mated together and we got

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.580 
and the tranny mated together and we got
the<00:01:00.470> cherry<00:01:00.770> picker<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:02.600> started<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.050> used<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
the cherry picker we started to used the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.160 
the cherry picker we started to used the
the<00:01:04.400> load<00:01:04.610> leveler<00:01:05.089> we<00:01:05.330> started<00:01:05.659> attaching<00:01:06.080> it

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
the load leveler we started attaching it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.390 
the load leveler we started attaching it
to<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.290> block<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:06.799> one<00:01:07.009> thing<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.220> we

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
to the block but one thing that we

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.679 
to the block but one thing that we
overlooked<00:01:07.820> we<00:01:08.060> didn't<00:01:08.240> have<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.450> correct

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
overlooked we didn't have the correct

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.930 
overlooked we didn't have the correct
engine<00:01:09.110> bolts<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.070> luckily<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.430> caught<00:01:10.670> that

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
engine bolts so luckily we caught that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.690 
engine bolts so luckily we caught that
we<00:01:11.150> got<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.690> correct<00:01:11.990> bolts<00:01:12.620> in<00:01:12.800> place<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.580> we

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
we got the correct bolts in place and we

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.660 
we got the correct bolts in place and we
were<00:01:13.850> able<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.210> lift<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.780> engine<00:01:14.900> off<00:01:15.230> of<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
were able to lift the engine off of the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.480 
were able to lift the engine off of the
stand<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.230> get<00:01:18.230> it<00:01:18.410> into<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.830> engine<00:01:18.980> bay<00:01:19.280> it

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
stand and get it into the engine bay it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.610 
stand and get it into the engine bay it
was<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> little<00:01:19.820> tricky<00:01:20.120> because<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.170> angle

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
was a little tricky because the angle

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.160 
was a little tricky because the angle
even<00:01:21.890> though<00:01:21.980> we<00:01:22.100> used<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.370> load<00:01:22.550> leveler<00:01:23.170> it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
even though we used a load leveler it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.930 
even though we used a load leveler it
was<00:01:24.350> kind<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.590> hitting<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.040> back<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
was kind of hitting on the back of the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.140 
was kind of hitting on the back of the
tow<00:01:26.390> board<00:01:26.690> slightly<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:27.920> when<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:28.909> came<00:01:29.090> down

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
tow board slightly so when it came down

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.899 
tow board slightly so when it came down
to<00:01:29.330> drop<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.620> fuel<00:01:30.890> pump<00:01:31.190> was<00:01:31.430> slightly

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
to drop it in the fuel pump was slightly

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.670 
to drop it in the fuel pump was slightly
in<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.300> way<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.840> we<00:01:33.170> had<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.320> little<00:01:33.440> bit<00:01:33.650> of

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
in the way and we had a little bit of

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.219 
in the way and we had a little bit of
clearance<00:01:34.040> problem<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:34.659> we<00:01:35.659> decided<00:01:36.110> to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
clearance problem so we decided to

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.830 
clearance problem so we decided to
remove<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.130> engine<00:01:37.430> mounts<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.300> fuel<00:01:38.570> pump

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
remove the engine mounts the fuel pump

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.630 
remove the engine mounts the fuel pump
also<00:01:39.050> had<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.440> come<00:01:39.620> off<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.340> can<00:01:40.520> get

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
also had to come off so we can get

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.040 
also had to come off so we can get
everything<00:01:41.030> shifted<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.720> proper

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
everything shifted in the proper

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.899 
everything shifted in the proper
location<00:01:42.560> before<00:01:42.860> we<00:01:42.950> got<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.190> bolts<00:01:43.400> back<00:01:43.640> in

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
location before we got the bolts back in

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.240 
location before we got the bolts back in
the<00:01:44.690> pumps<00:01:45.020> plumbing<00:01:45.380> location<00:01:45.860> created

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
the pumps plumbing location created

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.950 
the pumps plumbing location created
clearance<00:01:46.580> problems<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.180> quick<00:01:47.510> fix<00:01:47.750> was

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
clearance problems so a quick fix was

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.140 
clearance problems so a quick fix was
needed<00:01:48.260> fuel<00:01:48.979> pump<00:01:49.250> they<00:01:49.430> just<00:01:49.670> had<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> couple

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150

tubing<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:27.090> fabricated<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.989> small<00:03:28.620> little

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
tubing and we fabricated a small little

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.340 
tubing and we fabricated a small little
bracket<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.910> would<00:03:30.180> normally<00:03:30.959> use<00:03:30.989> in

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
bracket that you would normally use in

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.470 
bracket that you would normally use in
this<00:03:31.470> type<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.680> an<00:03:31.890> application<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.760> was<00:03:33.269> just

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this type of an application I was just

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.810 
this type of an application I was just
basically<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:34.260> square<00:03:34.620> bracket<00:03:34.830> we<00:03:35.160> cut<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> 90

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
basically a square bracket we cut a 90

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.640 
basically a square bracket we cut a 90
degree<00:03:36.090> angle<00:03:36.120> into<00:03:36.570> it

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
degree angle into it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.610 
degree angle into it
did<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> couple<00:03:38.670> little<00:03:39.000> shapes<00:03:39.239> onto<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> or

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
did a couple little shapes onto it or

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.800 
did a couple little shapes onto it or
radius<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> edges<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.910> drilled<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.780> couple

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
radius the edges and drilled a couple

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.170 
radius the edges and drilled a couple
holes<00:03:43.200> into<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.220> welded<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> small<00:03:44.970> little

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
holes into it and welded a small little

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.610 
holes into it and welded a small little
tab<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.540> keep<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.810> from<00:03:45.930> shifting<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
tab to keep it from shifting on the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500 
tab to keep it from shifting on the
carburetor<00:03:47.040> edgers<00:03:47.670> welding<00:03:48.090> skills<00:03:48.209> would

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
carburetor edgers welding skills would

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.060 
carburetor edgers welding skills would
be<00:03:48.570> put<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.900> good<00:03:49.049> use<00:03:49.110> today<00:03:49.590> as<00:03:49.799> minor

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
be put to good use today as minor

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.890 
be put to good use today as minor
modifications<00:03:50.910> were<00:03:51.030> also<00:03:51.330> needed<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.660> change

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
modifications were also needed to change

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.840 
modifications were also needed to change
the<00:03:52.049> angle<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.560> brake<00:03:52.709> pedal<00:03:53.040> arm<00:03:53.220> with

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
the angle of the brake pedal arm with

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.550 
the angle of the brake pedal arm with
the<00:03:53.970> drivetrain<00:03:54.360> setting<00:03:54.870> key<00:03:55.019> components

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the drivetrain setting key components

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.229 
the drivetrain setting key components
clear<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.860> obstruction<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.760> front<00:03:57.030> clip

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
clear of obstruction the front clip

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.970 
clear of obstruction the front clip
could<00:03:57.420> go<00:03:57.510> back<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.750> where<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.170> lives<00:03:58.380> until<00:03:58.920> we

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
could go back to where it lives until we

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.310 
could go back to where it lives until we
need<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.310> take<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.580> off<00:03:59.670> again<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.180> again<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
need to take it off again and again and

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.960 
need to take it off again and again and
again
