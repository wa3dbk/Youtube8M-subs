00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.400
 dutch is very strong on this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.289
 string orchestra for young talents 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.059
 a large part of our members is done 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.340
 young talent class of the concept oils 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.800
 and another part 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 lessons with private teachers and we see 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 each other here at our door from Amsterdam 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.300
 every Saturday for our rehearsals some 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 I try 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.159
 is a whole of the members 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 require a professional attitude 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.610
 so really your own responsibility 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.649
 wear really well prepared really 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.790
 up to the highest level for you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.229
 at that moment 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.790
 the functioning in the 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.339
 I always try programming one 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.189
 combination of the large 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 standard work and some challenging or 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.909
 sometimes also new 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 repetoire I think it's important to that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.820
 entire color palette of that music 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 to offer at this young age 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.200
 considered good going close my eyes I 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.750
 I have had many students or 13 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.130
 14 15 years who often doubt that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 whether or not they go to the young talent 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 department or lack of storm and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 actually because they are in it and you like that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.170
 like-minded people arrived 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 which makes them a huge mentally 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.710
 made a regional move 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 youth orchestra and that was all very well 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.340
 cozy and fun 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 but in the one and so i really learn to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.119
 fine tune to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.250
 very very good precision to work it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.140
 nice thing is that you learn as you develop 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.969
 can do best to give your students one 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
 professional mentality 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.780
 to get 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 But it often turns out it's real 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 works like them with kindred spirits 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:17.190
 see it in you in a few months 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:19.470
 have played together what i one of the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 most important things about music 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.310
 that is it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.989
 that it remains pleasant that it too 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 is pleasant to do 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.660
 that people feel comfortable and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.690
 you actually notice that too 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.470
 such high demands and the and so you become the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.849
 silent 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.579
 that they are thereby also explained and 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.260
 that that is also part of the fun that 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.060
 the and have if you just ask 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.849
 is there a willingness to do that? 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.950
 try and the ears and awful 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.569
 pointed and so it really isn't 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.890
 that is really working together that really adds up 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.209
 in the groups themselves that people say oh 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.489
 that was not so nice, we want that 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.530
 do it differently or yes no, there are many of us 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.730
 too hard or we don't want that 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.200
 And that's nice to notice that people 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.030
 I am really involved that way 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.329
 recently listened to a cd of the one 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.549
 and have participated in so many times and 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.010
 it struck me that it was the level like that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.620
 is incredibly good 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.670
 And then I realized that I was in that 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.470
 orchestra 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.700
 have learned to work professionally but that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.030
 so you really wear the rest of your life 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 be with that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.459
 experiences and lessons that you on everything 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.410
 can apply the go if you later 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.410
 music so are ma or another book 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.300
 practice and of course on the social 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.720
 aspect you really learn with them 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.910
 all other types of children deal with 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.230
 who might otherwise not recognize or 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.230
 through the language of music 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.810
 I just want you and very much like all these 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.150
 keep doing beautiful things with them 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.879
 great soloist to work and time in the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.250
 Make the recording for 2 years because you notice 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.680
 that is incredibly good for the children 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.670
 also to experience such a CD recording and me 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.620
 definitely want to think in the same year with op 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.480
 Tour can always touch me 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.489
 again not only as my own children 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.459
 make music but also like others 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.019
 children make music together and that is possible 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.019
 We think you are this orchestra very well
