00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
take a week of gun like the Breton and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.840 
take a week of gun like the Breton and
throw<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.290> an<00:01:10.409> armor<00:01:10.680> penetration<00:01:10.860> mod

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.520 

check<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.060> out<00:01:17.090> one<00:01:17.630> hit<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.110> head<00:01:18.290> and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
check that out one hit in the head and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.020 
check that out one hit in the head and
the<00:01:18.650> armor<00:01:18.980> penetration<00:01:19.160> tears<00:01:19.730> right

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
the armor penetration tears right

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.230 
the armor penetration tears right
through<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.360> stupid<00:01:21.020> little<00:01:21.170> box<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.590> theirs

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
through that stupid little box of theirs

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.030 
through that stupid little box of theirs
the<00:01:23.240> corpus<00:01:23.630> take<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> ton<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.350> damage<00:01:24.500> when<00:01:24.830> hit

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
the corpus take a ton of damage when hit

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.890 
the corpus take a ton of damage when hit
in<00:01:25.160> unprotected<00:01:25.460> areas<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.570> great

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
in unprotected areas so this is a great

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.780 
in unprotected areas so this is a great
tactic<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.530> use<00:01:27.710> not<00:01:28.010> only<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.430> kill<00:01:28.640> them

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
tactic to use not only to kill them

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.310 
tactic to use not only to kill them
quickly<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.450> save<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.660> little<00:01:29.840> ammo<00:01:30.200> as

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
quickly but to save a little ammo as

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.070 
quickly but to save a little ammo as
well<00:01:30.580> tip<00:01:31.580> number<00:01:31.760> three<00:01:32.150> passive<00:01:32.780> armor

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
well tip number three passive armor

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.590 
well tip number three passive armor
penetration<00:01:33.729> so<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:34.880> went<00:01:34.970> over<00:01:35.240> how<00:01:35.390> much

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
penetration so we went over how much

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.300 
penetration so we went over how much
armor<00:01:35.930> penetration<00:01:36.110> can<00:01:36.650> devastate<00:01:36.979> the

armor penetration can devastate the
