00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
latch mechanism we got the lock out and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.129 
latch mechanism we got the lock out and
obviously<00:00:10.670> you<00:00:11.540> can<00:00:11.690> see<00:00:11.780> I've<00:00:11.870> got<00:00:11.959> two<00:00:12.049> here

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
obviously you can see I've got two here

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.390 
obviously you can see I've got two here
I'm<00:00:12.259> a<00:00:12.290> sawhorse<00:00:12.469> I've<00:00:12.799> already<00:00:13.040> got<00:00:13.160> it<00:00:13.280> out

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
I'm a sawhorse I've already got it out

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.159 
I'm a sawhorse I've already got it out
the<00:00:13.610> only<00:00:13.759> reason<00:00:13.849> I<00:00:14.179> did<00:00:14.839> this<00:00:14.959> is<00:00:15.019> because

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:15.169 
the only reason I did this is because

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.290 
the only reason I did this is because
it's<00:00:15.589> a<00:00:15.679> lot<00:00:15.860> easier<00:00:16.000> to<00:00:17.000> film<00:00:17.660> this<00:00:18.430> with<00:00:19.430> the

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
it's a lot easier to film this with the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.730 
it's a lot easier to film this with the
latch<00:00:20.480> mechanism<00:00:20.720> out<00:00:21.200> of<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.320> truck<00:00:21.560> there's

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
latch mechanism out of the truck there's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.100 
latch mechanism out of the truck there's
just<00:00:21.890> no<00:00:22.010> room<00:00:22.510> you<00:00:23.510> just<00:00:23.540> wouldn't<00:00:23.900> be<00:00:24.020> able

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
just no room you just wouldn't be able

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.350 
just no room you just wouldn't be able
to<00:00:24.200> see<00:00:24.410> what<00:00:24.530> I'm<00:00:24.620> doing<00:00:24.650> very<00:00:25.100> well<00:00:25.180> if<00:00:26.180> this

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
to see what I'm doing very well if this

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.730 
to see what I'm doing very well if this
was<00:00:26.510> still<00:00:26.690> mounted<00:00:26.960> in<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.170> truck<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:27.560> this

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
was still mounted in the truck so this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.740 
was still mounted in the truck so this
is<00:00:27.890> only<00:00:27.980> held<00:00:28.250> on<00:00:28.400> by<00:00:29.270> three<00:00:29.540> bolts<00:00:30.370> one<00:00:31.370> there

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
is only held on by three bolts one there

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.680 
is only held on by three bolts one there
one<00:00:32.750> there<00:00:32.950> one<00:00:33.950> there<00:00:33.980> there's<00:00:34.399> your<00:00:34.520> little

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
one there one there there's your little

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.060 
one there one there there's your little
bear<00:00:35.690> claw<00:00:35.899> latch<00:00:36.140> mechanism<00:00:36.379> right<00:00:36.859> there

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
bear claw latch mechanism right there

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.500 
bear claw latch mechanism right there
but<00:00:37.989> it's<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.199> it's<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.219> striker<00:00:40.609> like<00:00:41.300> that

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
but it's the it's the striker like that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.160 
but it's the it's the striker like that
so<00:00:42.519> we've<00:00:43.519> got<00:00:43.699> that<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.749> now<00:00:44.870> I'm<00:00:44.960> going<00:00:45.079> to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
so we've got that and now I'm going to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.229 
so we've got that and now I'm going to
show<00:00:45.289> you<00:00:45.350> these<00:00:46.039> little<00:00:46.280> tabs<00:00:46.670> here<00:00:46.999> they're

show you these little tabs here they're
kind<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.539> tricky<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.929> get<00:00:48.140> out<00:00:48.319> and<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.879> is

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
kind of tricky to get out and this is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.959 
kind of tricky to get out and this is
what<00:00:50.210> they<00:00:50.359> look<00:00:50.539> like<00:00:51.489> it's<00:00:52.489> just<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.760> very

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.360 
you take a really small flat bladed
screwdriver<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.769> get<00:03:19.769> underneath<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.160> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
screwdriver you get underneath and you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.000 
screwdriver you get underneath and you
pry<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.239> get<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.510> little<00:03:21.660> Tang<00:03:22.010> out

pry it up you get that little Tang out

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.870 
pry it up you get that little Tang out
of<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.310> hole<00:03:24.650> okay<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> just<00:03:26.459> pull<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
of that hole okay so you just pull it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.220 
of that hole okay so you just pull it
out<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.190> then<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.310> slide<00:03:29.840> once<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:30.989> out<00:03:31.110> of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
out and then you slide once it's out of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.789 
out and then you slide once it's out of
its<00:03:31.350> little<00:03:31.440> hole<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:33.380> slide<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.590> whole

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
its little hole you slide the whole

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.270 
its little hole you slide the whole
retaining<00:03:35.760> clip<00:03:36.000> upwards<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:37.110> like<00:03:38.040> that

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
retaining clip upwards just like that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.620 
retaining clip upwards just like that
now<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:38.880> not<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.239> come<00:03:39.360> all<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> way

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
now it's not going to come all the way

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.170 
now it's not going to come all the way
out<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.840> yet<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.459> we've<00:03:41.579> got<00:03:41.760> two<00:03:41.850> slit<00:03:42.030> up

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
out just yet so we've got two slit up

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.780 
out just yet so we've got two slit up
it's<00:03:42.390> outside<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:43.230> not<00:03:45.049> it's<00:03:46.049> no<00:03:46.230> longer

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
it's outside it's not it's no longer

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.039 
it's outside it's not it's no longer
attached<00:03:47.790> around<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.540> little<00:03:48.630> machined

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
attached around that little machined

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.400 
attached around that little machined
area<00:03:49.320> come<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.560> focus<00:03:49.799> there<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.250> go<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.290> it's

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
area come on focus there we go so it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.660 
area come on focus there we go so it's
no<00:03:52.560> longer<00:03:52.859> attached<00:03:53.130> around<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.489> little

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
no longer attached around that little

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.620 
no longer attached around that little
machine<00:03:53.790> Gary<00:03:54.209> oh<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.440> now<00:03:56.090> your<00:03:57.090> linkage<00:03:57.420> just

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
machine Gary oh so now your linkage just

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.050 
machine Gary oh so now your linkage just
pops<00:03:57.840> out<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:59.010> these<00:03:59.130> don't<00:03:59.370> really<00:03:59.640> fall<00:03:59.849> out

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
pops out and these don't really fall out

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.740 
pops out and these don't really fall out
that<00:04:00.239> one<00:04:00.360> obviously<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.930> fell<00:04:01.110> out<00:04:01.310> but

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
that one obviously just fell out but

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.790 
that one obviously just fell out but
that'll<00:04:04.750> usually<00:04:04.870> kind<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.350> stay<00:04:05.500> in<00:04:05.530> place

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
that'll usually kind of stay in place

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.760 
that'll usually kind of stay in place
you<00:04:05.980> pull<00:04:06.190> your<00:04:06.340> linkage<00:04:06.640> out<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:08.650> you

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
you pull your linkage out and then you

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.980 
you pull your linkage out and then you
pull<00:04:08.950> your<00:04:09.070> little<00:04:09.190> tab<00:04:09.460> off<00:04:09.670> like<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.090> and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
pull your little tab off like that and

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.960 
pull your little tab off like that and
it's<00:04:11.140> really<00:04:11.380> just<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.710> easy<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.370> like<00:04:12.940> I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
it's really just that easy so like I
