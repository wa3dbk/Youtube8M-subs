it just has too much focus there's still

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.220 
it just has too much focus there's still
some<00:03:29.120> redeeming<00:03:29.389> qualities<00:03:29.540> in<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.019> first

weaknesses<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.489> Bradford's<00:03:44.000> work<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.449> that

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
weaknesses of Bradford's work is that

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.750 
weaknesses of Bradford's work is that
the<00:03:44.750> stories<00:03:45.079> are<00:03:45.109> often<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.680> little<00:03:45.980> choppy<00:03:46.310> as

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
the stories are often a little choppy as

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.030 
the stories are often a little choppy as
much<00:03:47.030> as<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.269> love<00:03:47.629> Iron<00:03:48.049> Giant<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.769> lot<00:03:48.949> of

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
much as I love Iron Giant and a lot of

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.439 
much as I love Iron Giant and a lot of
his<00:03:49.129> other<00:03:49.280> works<00:03:49.609> I'll<00:03:49.879> be<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.120> first<00:03:50.299> to

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
his other works I'll be the first to

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.270 
his other works I'll be the first to
admit<00:03:50.629> that<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.379> narratives<00:03:51.769> are<00:03:51.859> not<00:03:51.889> very

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
admit that the narratives are not very

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.580 
admit that the narratives are not very
flowing<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:53.180> mean<00:03:53.239> they<00:03:53.599> work<00:03:53.780> okay<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.530> the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
flowing I mean they work okay and the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.990 
flowing I mean they work okay and the
characters<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.129> think<00:03:55.160> are<00:03:55.400> ultimately<00:03:55.760> what

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
characters I think are ultimately what

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.550 
characters I think are ultimately what
pulls<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.329> through<00:03:56.359> but<00:03:57.049> they<00:03:57.139> always<00:03:57.349> seem<00:03:57.530> to

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
pulls it through but they always seem to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.039 
pulls it through but they always seem to
jump<00:03:57.919> around<00:03:58.099> a<00:03:58.519> bit<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.760> always<00:03:59.120> feel<00:03:59.329> one<00:03:59.750> more

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
jump around a bit I always feel one more

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.750 
jump around a bit I always feel one more
rewrite<00:04:00.680> would<00:04:00.889> probably<00:04:01.280> make<00:04:01.400> these<00:04:01.579> films

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
rewrite would probably make these films

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.000 
rewrite would probably make these films
a<00:04:01.970> little<00:04:02.209> stronger<00:04:02.510> but<00:04:02.900> again<00:04:03.319> that's<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.799> no

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
a little stronger but again that's in no

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.890 
a little stronger but again that's in no
way<00:04:04.280> saying<00:04:04.669> that<00:04:04.879> The<00:04:05.120> Incredibles<00:04:05.359> or<00:04:05.810> as

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
way saying that The Incredibles or as

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.780 
way saying that The Incredibles or as
other<00:04:06.049> films<00:04:06.500> are<00:04:06.620> by<00:04:06.769> any<00:04:06.949> means<00:04:07.280> failures

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790

other films are by any means failures
they're<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.840> strongest<00:04:09.049> point<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.530> the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
they're not the strongest point of the

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
all the stuff that you're waiting for

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.000 
all the stuff that you're waiting for
and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.860 
and
is<00:04:20.070> well<00:04:20.310> worth<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:20.730> wait<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.240> only<00:04:21.540> wish<00:04:21.750> I

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
is well worth the wait I only wish I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.910 
is well worth the wait I only wish I
could<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.140> seen<00:04:22.290> more<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.890> the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
could have seen more of this in the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.280 
could have seen more of this in the
first<00:04:23.280> 2/3<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.660> if<00:04:24.750> they<00:04:24.870> did<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.110> I

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
first 2/3 I think if they did that I

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.260 
first 2/3 I think if they did that I
probably<00:04:25.710> would<00:04:26.100> have<00:04:26.130> really<00:04:26.670> loved<00:04:26.940> this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
probably would have really loved this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.420 
probably would have really loved this
movie<00:04:27.510> but<00:04:28.170> for<00:04:28.440> what<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.770> when<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.280> does

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
movie but for what it is when it does

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.950 
movie but for what it is when it does
get<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.760> parts<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:30.180> does<00:04:30.480> really<00:04:30.720> well

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
get to the parts that does really well

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.320 
get to the parts that does really well
it's<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.500> ton<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.740> fun<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.280> it's<00:04:32.700> smart<00:04:33.030> and
