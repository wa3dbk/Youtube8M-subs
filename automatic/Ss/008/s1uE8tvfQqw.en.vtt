00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.719
 hello everyone good if you comment and 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.910
 good to start a round 20 in 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.529
 survival in newtown so you can see 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.210
 in the simplest and easiest way to 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.430
 do it then the first thing that 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.919
 we're going to do is come here and we take the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.230
 room here 74 is worth directly as 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.880
 we have points we are going to take it from 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.410
 listen to that good alarm well every time 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.239
 that those sirens go up means that 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.130
 they are not releasing a per that is worth not 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.809
 we have none and they will be letting go 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.969
 little by little as that sounds 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.380
 alarm anywhere on the map where 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.090
 then we are going to come here to the 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.830
 green house and let's go 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.570
 making little balls with the zombies up 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.700
 complete all and have them all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 behind we will go looking for the holes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.110
 great without complicating us between always 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.280
 looking for big holes to not stop 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.050
 do not throw us because we have two 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 touches we are dead then what 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 first they are going to let us go when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.140
 the sirens sound the quick revive of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.360
 let's go and take the quick revive 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 and then then randomly we 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.270
 they're going to keep dropping the whole area but 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 good if we are lucky then we 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.400
 will jump the titan fast and then not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 We will have no problem if it were to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 from round 1 you can give us 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.070
 the titan even in round 17 or 18 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.470
 but good people can be done because 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.570
 it's easy and I 'm going to show you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.910
 So what we are going to do is kill 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 the zombies are going to leave a crossing and 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.080
 when we have a kröller a thrown a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.729
 stump as you want to call the cross of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 zombie then we're going to go 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.509
 we are going to take ourselves directly 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.430
 all measures well then let's 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.430
 follow and now we keep hitting 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.670
 well we have not left the mutilated 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.200
 then let's come here we're going to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.660
 take revive quickly because we have it 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.780
 given here and then now I explain 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.120
 it may fall there or in all 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.250
 sites where these boxes are worth here 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.050
 there are other there are also some that are 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580
 hidden are worth a few dogs and we 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 they have put here also so that we 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.850
 Let's look for life out there, go find it 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.740
 but they 're all out there then it's worth 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.970
 They can be anywhere where 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.580
 there are those boxes that I have explained 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.460
 ok then now let's go here 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.899
 and how he has continued giving us things now 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.120
 you may not have the titan see here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.190
 here is the perfect titan then no 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.290
 we are going to take it there is also the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.060
 double shot but now as we have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.380
 four thousand-odd points what we're going to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.300
 do before taking the double shot and 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.880
 load we are going to go directly to the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.440
 box and let's see what they give us what 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.240
 let us then we run now 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.790
 they are going to let us loose this is quero cidade 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.680
 shit that is not worth or material will be 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.770
 head a zombie then what are we going 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 do is throw another sister we go 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.540
 to catch this weapon that is perfect in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.250
 the 27 m we are going to throw one more time though 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.840
 I always say leave a mattress 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 of points to be able to take the titan 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 in case they throw us away but hey do not walk 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.300
 city ​​and we will not be able to 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.540
 let's keep doing rounds 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.700
 let's continue here we go let's go 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.970
 to kill the zombie and now we continue with the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.970
 round 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 good now when you listen to this watch 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.380
 it means that every time you listen 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.780
 the clock we have killed 100 zombies 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.130
 every time we send 100 zombies here 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 in the door that there is right if 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.740
 opposite there is a by 2 there is a bomb there 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.230
 a skull anything good salt 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.300
 well every time the clock sounds this 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.250
 change before a good gate 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.230
 Well now there is a bomb every time 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.480
 it sounds like the clock changes every time 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.120
 we kill without zombies that happens well then 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 when we achieve this for the first time 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.530
 One thing that will give us a window 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.600
 then it 's like an opportunity and that 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.100
 they give us if we need to open it 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560
 for any emergency, well, there 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.120
 would be to catch it in case it did 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 what was missing then you 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.340
 I recommend that you do not do it until last 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.010
 moment is good then good people 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.770
 more than I have to catch the advantage 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.600
 is there for the gift and I would continue with the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.850
 round I hope you liked it and already
