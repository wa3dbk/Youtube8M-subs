00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 the camera can not be recording the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.340
 Patricia, a 41-year-old woman, is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.460
 very pretty and I find it very similar 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.680
 with monica belluci a track and and she 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 have a way of dressing in a way 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.369
 very childish that she wants to seem more 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
 young and this is a big mistake of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.340
 people want teen clothing 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.560
 type rosinha in these colors clothes 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.149
 because they want to look younger in the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 truth its the opposite 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.170
 so we are showing her that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 gives look younger in a more 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.110
 mature then you will see a result 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.110
 what a family 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.270
 the main is what you like the most 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.080
 after theft 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.400
 I can try to go a good way with 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.400
 drink in a broader way 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.960
 when I watched the footage the recording 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.700
 of the fashion squad, and I see that 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.520
 the transformation of participants 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.710
 really goes much more than that of 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.630
 the clothes go on psychologically so the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.270
 that isabella arlindo does not make 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.880
 participants is very professional so 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.950
 is very interesting because they change the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.170
 way of thinking even I sincerely 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 when I saw the program before entering 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.960
 to work on sbt 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.850
 I found that some participants 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.520
 be combined even if you do not 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.530
 believe but really nothing that is 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.900
 combined years learn yet 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.229
 It 's really cool to see I saw this change. 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.229
 in their lives 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.229
 ool 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.450
 I'm liking the main person in the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.610
 very cool production applicators and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.100
 mimosa that was a bit angry on the first day 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.080
 but now I loved the shopping yesterday 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.220
 to be quite a flight today by the second 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.720
 day with the way the stores 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.520
 program are chosen 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.310
 the presenters together with the production 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.170
 fashion and the production they make a list 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.360
 with the profile of stores that we can 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 record and so we get in touch 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.010
 with them to see if they have room for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.740
 receive our team and then the people 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.690
 closes and partners with them in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.360
 true the whole team did everything they are 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.550
 great, they split up, they talked a lot 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.160
 about combinations what does she have to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.160
 putting on is being super cool 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:39.450
 her husband's face of disapproval is up 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.450
 very bad, zero grade 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 every rental we go is a case 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.950
 different 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.260
 I have to mess with the pictures. 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.230
 connected I can not turn off the power 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.270
 to hinder the movement of stores 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.980
 all the competent team gives a bit of 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.360
 We work to make this program 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.360
 you are worth it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.090
 unfortunately put my career as a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.160
 back to clothes him because nobody 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.440
 more is ahead after having attention 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.020
 Wonderful with your beautiful clothes, huh? 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.020
 This is for sure, let's go straight from the trash.
