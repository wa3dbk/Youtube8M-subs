from an injection molded polycarbonate
it's<00:00:38.129> actually<00:00:38.430> manufacturing<00:00:38.969> four<00:00:39.360> shell

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it's actually manufacturing four shell

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020 
it's actually manufacturing four shell
sizes<00:00:40.250> considering<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> price<00:00:41.520> tag<00:00:41.790> between

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030

sizes considering a price tag between
180<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.840> 280<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.969> that's<00:00:44.969> pretty<00:00:45.300> crazy

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
180 and 280 here that's pretty crazy

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.670 
180 and 280 here that's pretty crazy
because<00:00:45.809> there's<00:00:46.050> helmets<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.469> worth

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because there's helmets that are worth

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
because there's helmets that are worth
twice<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.219> three<00:00:47.399> times<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.789> much<00:00:47.969> almost

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
twice or three times that much almost

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
twice or three times that much almost
that<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.840> only<00:00:48.960> manufactured<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.739> two<00:00:49.860> or

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that are only manufactured in two or

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.040 
that are only manufactured in two or
three<00:00:50.160> homicides<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.820> shell<00:00:51.030> sizes<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.780> very

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
three homicides or shell sizes so very

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
three homicides or shell sizes so very
very<00:00:52.230> cool<00:00:52.489> also<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> find

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
very cool also what you're going to find

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
very cool also what you're going to find
is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> lot<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.660> vent<00:00:54.840> systems<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
is a lot of vent systems here so on the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.040 
is a lot of vent systems here so on the
front<00:00:56.820> underneath<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:57.809> adjust

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
front underneath you can actually adjust

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.840 
front underneath you can actually adjust
this<00:00:58.379> vent<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.160> intakes<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.730> can

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this vent here these are intakes you can

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
this vent here these are intakes you can
adjust<00:01:00.149> underneath<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> chin<00:01:00.870> bar<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> then

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
adjust underneath the chin bar and then

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
adjust underneath the chin bar and then
you've<00:01:01.859> also<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.699> top<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you've also got this one on top of the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
you've also got this one on top of the
chin<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.510> helps<00:01:03.780> funnel<00:01:04.080> air<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.979> one

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
chin which helps funnel air up this one

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.399 
chin which helps funnel air up this one
across<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> top<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> brow<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> also<00:01:07.229> this

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
across the top of the brow and also this

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
across the top of the brow and also this
big<00:01:07.770> vent<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.280> top<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.150> are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
big vent up top all of these are

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
big vent up top all of these are
adjustable<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> twin<00:01:10.860> channel<00:01:11.250> vent

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
adjustable this is the twin channel vent

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
adjustable this is the twin channel vent
this<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.299> huge<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.560> that's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this thing is huge now one thing that's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
this thing is huge now one thing that's
worth<00:01:13.860> noting<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.700> drill<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> holes

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
worth noting when they drill the holes

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
worth noting when they drill the holes
for<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.659> vents<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.229> don't<00:01:16.380> drill<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
for these vents they don't drill them in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
for these vents they don't drill them in
at<00:01:16.979> 90<00:01:17.250> degrees<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.909> air<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> passes

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
at 90 degrees so the air just passes

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.080 
at 90 degrees so the air just passes
across<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.140> drill<00:01:19.380> 45<00:01:20.040> degrees<00:01:20.430> which<00:01:20.820> helps

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
across they drill 45 degrees which helps

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
across they drill 45 degrees which helps
channel<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> air<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:21.930> you're<00:01:22.020> actually

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
channel the air and so you're actually

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
channel the air and so you're actually
getting<00:01:22.439> better<00:01:22.740> air<00:01:23.040> flow<00:01:23.070> than<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> standard

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
getting better air flow than a standard

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
getting better air flow than a standard
