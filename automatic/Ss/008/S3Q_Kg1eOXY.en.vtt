00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.990
 welcome to the youtube channel of masoni 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.270
 online 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.240
 today we will explain to you then keep on 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.380
 most of the tech tec is wood 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.390
 prince outside thanks to the fact that he is 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.750
 naturally roses and therefore protected 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.469
 from atmospheric agents 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.070
 then the tech exposed to sun water 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.579
 I warn ice does n't even tell us later 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:50.290
 one two three years but changes color 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.340
 therefore from golden orange as we are 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 used to seeing it oxidizes and tends to 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.630
 become silver in the countries 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.890
 Nordics the tech really like 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:11.229
 let go then oxidized and di 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.409
 silver color while it is typical custom 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.149
 of the Mediterranean countries to keep it from 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.210
 this color we are used to 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.319
 seeing it does not change anything then the tech 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.590
 it does not spoil if it is oxidized but it is 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:29.700
 just an aesthetic question for 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:35.380
 keep it of this color the tech goes 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.130
 washed then wet with water or 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.179
 with pressure washer being careful to head 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:48.399
 not to use too openings 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:51.399
 high and do not direct the jet 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:56.939
 water of the two cleaner from too 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.159
 near then ruining the wood and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.179
 raising the splinters 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.920
 once this is done i'm wet 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.420
 washed the tech with the pressure washer 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.130
 you need to spray with the green and here 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.440
 we have royal botania products 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.770
 because crime is nothing but a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.010
 acid product that then it is 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.880
 will have to spray all the wood well 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.120
 table and chairs that we have e 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.850
 rinsed with space on 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.750
 procedure can be done several times 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:39.340
 if brands remain and if necessary yes 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.810
 can define everything with the card you have 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.390
 very fine 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.160
 once the tea was clean like 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.900
 we explained to you can be put 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.970
 oil or wax 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.170
 here we always have the air robot on 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.400
 textile that you pay attention to once 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:05.860
 that the tech is oiled colored legs 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.670
 this protects it from oxide 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:14.410
 effectively but the tech becomes 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:18.930
 much more red and dark personally a 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.400
 I like it left natural and so 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.790
 I strongly advise against the use of 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.240
 transparent paints or by 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.410
 impregnating with this is all 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.390
 if you want to keep clean follow i 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.020
 our advice and the next video bye 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.020
 and soon
