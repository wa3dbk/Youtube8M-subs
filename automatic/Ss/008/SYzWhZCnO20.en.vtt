is really more like a decal if you look

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
is really more like a decal if you look
at<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.590> close<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.610> serves<00:01:20.880> its<00:01:21.090> purpose

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
and I've also elected to go with the
black<00:01:23.430> front<00:01:23.790> rather<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.450> white<00:01:24.689> which

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
black front rather than the white which

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
black front rather than the white which
I<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:25.710> looks<00:01:25.740> quite<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> bit<00:01:26.250> better<00:01:26.600> of
