00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.519
 so worth it before we start take 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 completely new plastic and divide it by 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:23.340
 drum we have a couple ways of doing 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.689
 how to do it correctly one of us 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.220
 the joke was called the way of the opposite 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.180
 is that I am not in order 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.090
 to move in a circle 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.879
 one screw to another than we do 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.210
 later we move forward back left 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.210
 to the right 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.440
 can win screws in any 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.890
 sequence while using it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.870
 we generally have a modification method 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 this island depending on the amount 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.400
 screws you can find a detailed description 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.810
 on site events so 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 when you first time plastic department 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.960
 drum there is such an old belief that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 the screws must be tightened to the limit so that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 let the plastic sit down 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.970
 but it is completely wrong similar 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.049
 interference can damage plastic 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.500
 plastics damage right at the beginning 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.880
 will make its setting impossible and so 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.680
 according to my theory 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.770
 which works mean is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.259
 do not need to be properly tuned 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.579
 and then play 15 20 minutes then 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.250
 pull up yes but you again 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.110
 and play again and so on therefore 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.909
 if you play it naturally 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.509
 you will have no problems when he starts 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.420
 wear another important thing about 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.950
 home is about hiv and if you can 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.860
 customize the top plastic you can 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.829
 set up there in general such work 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.500
 plastics are moving all placer taizen 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.530
 need they need to move synchronously 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 if you tune them higher to another 1 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.100
 will start 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.750
 quickly come on slowly and leave someone 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.550
 on plastic should be the same as 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.680
 only you have configured the top you need 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.750
 make how about the additive very 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.760
 small twist and quarter key to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.760
 half while you tune the drum 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:41.860
 barely me center che pull up with 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:45.540
 opposite side he starts 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.540
 play a little bit it will start to resonate 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:03:03.010
 listen to the point where he is almost 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:07.270
 begins to resonate almost a year earlier 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.890
 resonates now you can drink that 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.870
 but yours you will often hear from me 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.880
 like listen and sing 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.860
 if you can sing a note copy 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.120
 her to my head is so drum 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.120
 It becomes a very simple matter 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.110
 it's a little hard but i hear 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:37.909
 of course it can't be a clean note 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:40.440
 because we don't set it up come on 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:44.090
 now we go in a circle set up 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.090
 in small steps 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.530
 learning process would be good for you 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.750
 master the technique of turning the drum 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 key it is virtually the same as 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.319
 Technique gift wand we need 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.390
 feel the amount of tension 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.609
 resistance generated key screw 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.340
 also be very neat in that 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.680
 as far as you turn it 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.810
 14 the other half on the whole 3 you 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.060
 get lost you gotta get 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.579
 susceptible to this is such a technique . 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:26.250
 without that drinking center we go to drink 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:29.039
 next to the screw you need to do 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:36.030
 materials only you decide a new note 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:38.330
 try to sing it too hear 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.330
 high 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.240
 now more and more open 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.240
 because it began to find a single note 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.870
 a little more different 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.630
 so now we're fine tuned drum i 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.730
 here is the whole technique that called the bon method 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.660
 opposition setting here this is when 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.070
 you adjust the opposite screws and 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.590
 plastic moves from one edge to 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.140
 to another entirely due to the fact that in paris 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:37.370
 weight on one side if you have two 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:39.650
 different notes with set screws to 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.960
 do it and intuitively you raised it 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:48.590
 to the life below which I twist the keys nothing 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:57.560
 does not happen but look what will happen 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:06:00.590
 if we do it now we have the same 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.870
 not a man is a great way to save it. 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.870
 in secret only between us see 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.410
 good toning sound
