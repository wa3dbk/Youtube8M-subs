00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 very good to everyone today we have in the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.069
 channel to Carlos Sainz that we are going to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.400
 make some cons questions about 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.340
 gp3 and a tad also of formula 1 very 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.929
 good afternoon karlos now good afternoon 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.780
 happy to have you here thank you very much 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.029
 for the interview and nothing because we're going to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.190
 start with the questions this first 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.630
 would be with in front of the gp3 season 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.300
 it will be a difficult season 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.369
 why 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.050
 as you've already seen in the first two 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.199
 races the first two appointments as there are 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.250
 a lot of tire degradation 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.379
 honestly we do not know where we are going to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.489
 be before the race 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.670
 normally you go with a little bit with the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.230
 knowing that you will be at 45 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.089
 first among the 10 but it is that at 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.790
 you better have a car to win or what 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.780
 you better have a car to be in 15 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.180
 everything depends a lot on the tires 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.500
 we are very limited by them but 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.530
 but good is what there is 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.600
 get used to it and good with desire 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.910
 wanting to continue to follow in good 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.740
 line performance differences between 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.020
 Cars 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.850
 none just the truth is that everything 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.800
 It depends on how you care for the tire 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.170
 car and how do you know how to take care of yourself 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.270
 with your riding style but here the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.740
 cars we all have the same engine 400 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.990
 horses we all have the same dynamics 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.940
 the only things that change are a little 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.470
 the suspensions but that each team what 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.320
 adapts a little to your pilot or your 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.670
 pilots and there are already big differences 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.280
 techniques between the circuits between 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.230
 different circuits of the world yes 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.160
 yes every circuit has its history every 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.960
 the circuit has its degradation every 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.940
 circuit has its fast curve its curve 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 slow you always have to adapt the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.560
 car for it and if it's always a 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.410
 difficult goal to accomplish so many steps 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.479
 to get to formula 1 good is very 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.480
 difficult for me to say formula 1 follows 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.520
 being a dream more than a goal 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.710
 I only try to do my 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.150
 dream reality and I know that for that reason 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.640
 first I have to do it well in the gp3 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.120
 if I get it right the gp3 could do it 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.830
 well in the bags and now if things 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.740
 they come out perfect because the form or 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.480
 does not ask said is a dream and not for 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.730
 nothing is 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.120
 an objective right now only my only 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.860
 goal is the gp3 here in spain a lot 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.570
 people have deposited in you very many 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.850
 hopes and a lot of illusion that 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.460
 that is the substitute in the future of 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.930
 fernando alonso in formula 1 currently 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.870
 we have a great pilot in formula1 like 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.630
 is alonso but but you really look with 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 possibility of being strong up there or 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.230
 well once again it is very complicated 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.720
 because for Fernando Alonso there is only one 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.670
 and there will only be one I'm sure but good 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.280
 I know you have high hopes in 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.920
 that I may one day arrive but one 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.400
 Again, it's very difficult, I'm still 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.320
 in gp3 I have at least two 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.270
 steps to get there and they are both 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.920
 tougher steps so you have to 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.690
 take it very calmly but what does 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 can have sure the people are to give 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.810
 the maximum to try to get there 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 the formula one I'm global pretty 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.330
 difficult too but what do you think of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.209
 alonso de ferrari of the good car 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.569
 I sincerely see Fernando this year 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.640
 better positioned than I ever think that 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.500
 can do a very good world and I think 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.410
 that is in its best year to be able to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.110
 to win it what I do believe is that red 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.660
 bull is still very strong and therefore 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.160
 even more after three worlds goes 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.420
 to be very complicated but I wish 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.190
 fernando wins and can win the title now 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.739
 I said a moment ago that this year 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 tires will be a conditioner 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.190
 very strong for the races because if 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.580
 you are aggressive at the beginning at the end of 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.650
 the race 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.049
 You will see a match before a hindrance and it is 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.580
 I would walk many cars in formula one 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.530
 something similar is happening 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.880
 super soft tires always 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.220
 you do a quick qualifying lap 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.660
 the next day in the race is very 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.670
 difficult to endure during the first 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.590
 tanda and good you what do you think about this 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.290
 do you think that pirelli that is the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.040
 provider of formula 1 and of gp3 must 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.040
 make the hardest 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.980
 at the end the gp3 is a quarry for 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.420
 give the shape to one and the pilots 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.520
 he has to learn the same tire 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.920
 well what is being used in formula one 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.350
 is pirelli so between three 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.150
 It also helps you learn not how to 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.640
 how to treat them but for me yes that is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.220
 true that is a little exaggerated not the 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.870
 degradation that there is can be had 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.510
 degradation but not so much no and now 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.520
 same is complicated for example today in 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.770
 and the other race because we had to go 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.790
 to 50 60 percent in the first 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.980
 turns to try to get to the end 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.430
 it becomes a complicated task 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.410
 but in the end if you want if you want is 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.320
 forward is the only thing you can do and 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.150
 good respect the decision of pirelli me 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.710
 it seems that in the end you want or not 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.990
 the races are very interesting this 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.980
 year and they are still the ones from a 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.230
 couple of years so in the end this 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.940
 sport is governed by television and by 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.320
 the show and the truth is that there 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.630
 racing that a show with these 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.590
 tires major differences between 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.900
 a formula 1 and a gp 3 simply because 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.640
 I believe that a formula 1 is double is 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.210
 twice as much power twice as 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.210
 aerodynamics 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.889
 little more tires and tires more 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.449
 wide carbon brakes cons 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.430
 but the normals 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.590
 quite a difference because in the end today 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.680
 in circuits like Barcelona because we are 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.210
 only 10 seconds away from them 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 thank you very much carlos a pleasure haberte 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.009
 had here 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.009
 thank you
