 Though it is Kyosen Shoko, which is a big peak than the other day 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:29.939
 why until just now I am plump 24 hours began to use the iij seen over large revision 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.220
 plan 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.670
 I put the sim card I signed in and used this buddy for a long time 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.650
 I think I did not use it during work. 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 Round-trip together of the company 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.040
 Meanwhile about two hours of facebook rather than bud to do in that e-mail 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.580
 It is comment return 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.570
 Is the number of times to reload the page of because I think that was often 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:06.670
 It is feeling that I have seen about 30 minutes when I go to Tsuicas from then 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.810
 It from youtube was another large say 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:16.360
 I feel like playing around 20 minutes 15 minutes 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:22.990
 It is the result I know is what long as you use quite 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.690
 If it is to be hit by a point, it is this iij's strange to be doing a hangar for this round now 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 It is an open war 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.950

 This time zone annual speed is great 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:42.170
 First of all, but will you see or with how much setup bad Do not effect one day before of a speed 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.899
 I guess it's a bit difficult to focus on 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.290
 This is the first 517 you by by 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.460
 Beneath it uses the 517 mb 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.760
 Sakai is too hot, and it has been 15 months since it was a month. 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.970
 Today's Waa might use to Kyokusai 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.760
 And 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:10.119
 Today's speed 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:13.260
 I hope this is a better way to focus on the bottom of i know 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.260
 I'm getting in because I'm asking 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:23.870

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.800
 Four 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.800
 Most of all, this is also a transition 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.400
 It's 5 and it's going to change with numbers like this in the middle of the morning 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.120
 And here 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.720
 I have a little fallen wonder if this is what poster 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.240
 I think that I can not see the image quality anymore 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.480
 This is a difficult a 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.990
 It's about 9 o'clock this evening 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.950
 It fell considerably 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:05.400
 The 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.269
 Let 's go down and see if the first one is like it and now this version isn't a Twicas version Carton parent 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.330
 You 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:16.250
 As for the speed down, 37 eyes are up and it is medium woman 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.250
 It's good that I always come out like this 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.770
 I feel like I'm stable according to love. This number is too much 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.920
 Downfall 37 eyes are right 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:31.410
 Yes and it's about 360 p when you play or youtube 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.010
 I felt like I could play it 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.150
 It just below it may take 5 hours to read that in the automatic mode 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:47.290
 But b is not a ratio of stress with Mr. File 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:49.770
 Yes, I was able to do from time to time read but still not there Well one day whether there once 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.790
 It was about 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:59.010
 The air and the bad point so far 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:05.070
 Tteyuu sim cards that have been used before there is not attached worry too much because it was arrays too 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:09.790
 I feel like I'm trying to buy this picture version now 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.920
 Round is I think the 37 th is six and climbing 10 people had come out a little 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.040
 There is no revision of lt now 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:22.960
 I know it pretty Kyoto Toka improvement of 3 c on the way it is and has been going back and forth and Osaka 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:28.810
 I wonder if there was an influence of speed on things like that. 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.740
 I Well the time being Yo Nde quite speed nor do Toka measured by the fact that the first day is today a force 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.060
 I wonder if 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.919
 Then I did it on purposely whether you would like to work properly on youtube 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.340
 I root 500 people I have said or the 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.249
 Well wonder if not it does not go up there 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.789
 If you wanted Well it goes as also Otsuki 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:51.229
 I also feel like a pooler 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:55.560
 I would like to try it this month for the time being. This is how it feels like a hangout in the big air today 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:59.760
 It is the I'm sorry a little image quality even worse Kedohon 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.130
 I would like to try out what would happen if three people aired on the hanger at about speed 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.800
 It was quite fast 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:11.150
 Also when that speed is slow I think I would like to do semi-Kura videos even outdoors 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.150
 Goodbye was Doug's tv
