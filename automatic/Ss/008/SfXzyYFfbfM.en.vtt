to these big important turning points in
the<00:03:43.110> scene

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
the scene

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.220 
the scene
because<00:03:44.459> we<00:03:44.610> can<00:03:44.849> see<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.390> only<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.720> dramatic

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.619 
because we can see not only the dramatic
actions<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.459> can<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.120> deepest

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
actions but we can see the deepest

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.229 
actions but we can see the deepest
effects<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.439> has<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.920> character<00:03:50.519> so

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
effects that it has on the character so
