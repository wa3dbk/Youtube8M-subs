00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
comfortable I've only had one issue

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.350 
comfortable I've only had one issue
where<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> blister<00:01:45.049> which<00:01:46.049> was<00:01:46.590> from<00:01:47.360> on

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
where I got a blister which was from on

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.319 
where I got a blister which was from on
my<00:01:48.570> left<00:01:48.869> pinky<00:01:49.290> toe<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:50.939> running<00:01:51.210> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
my left pinky toe but I was running in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
my left pinky toe but I was running in
really<00:01:51.600> hot<00:01:51.960> weather<00:01:52.380> without<00:01:53.009> any<00:01:53.220> socks<00:01:53.549> so

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
really hot weather without any socks so

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.569 
really hot weather without any socks so
I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.799> give<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> bit<00:01:56.490> of

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
I think you have to give them a bit of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.940 
I think you have to give them a bit of
credit<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:58.079> sole<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.520> shoe<00:01:59.549> is<00:02:00.090> actually

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
credit the sole of the shoe is actually

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.719 
credit the sole of the shoe is actually
made<00:02:01.950> by<00:02:01.979> libram<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.780> our<00:02:03.780> five<00:02:04.079> fingers<00:02:04.409> frame

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
made by libram of our five fingers frame

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.580 
made by libram of our five fingers frame
if<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> look<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.840> got<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> lug

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
if you have a look it's got a lug

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.500 
if you have a look it's got a lug
pattern<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> you've<00:02:08.819> got<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.390> sort<00:02:10.379> of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
pattern so you've got the more sort of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.060 
pattern so you've got the more sort of
hard<00:02:12.510> foam

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
hard foam

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.820 
hard foam
and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.640> underneath<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.690> think<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.380> was<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and then underneath I think it was the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.230 
and then underneath I think it was the
orange<00:02:17.280> layer<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:18.360> they<00:02:18.690> refer<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> as

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
orange layer is what they refer to as

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.280 
orange layer is what they refer to as
Activa<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:23.450> one<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.780> note<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.260> that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
Activa and one thing to note is that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.760 
Activa and one thing to note is that
while<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> provides<00:02:26.460> support<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.380> actual

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
while it provides support the actual

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.950 
while it provides support the actual
soul<00:02:29.280> itself<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:31.070> fairly<00:02:32.070> thin<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.780> see

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
soul itself is a fairly thin you can see

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.770 
soul itself is a fairly thin you can see
there<00:02:34.580> with<00:02:35.580> my<00:02:35.850> fingers

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.830 
there with my fingers
hopefully<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.670> sort<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> thickness<00:02:39.570> of

hopefully that sort of the thickness of
the<00:02:40.080> sole<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.370> not<00:02:41.520> very<00:02:41.910> thick<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the sole so it's not very thick it is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.300 
the sole so it's not very thick it is
however<00:02:43.770> incredibly<00:02:44.730> flexible<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:46.920> see

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
however incredibly flexible you can see

and do that or flex up basically into a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.430 
and do that or flex up basically into a
ball<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.680> allows<00:02:53.490> your<00:02:53.670> foot<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> move<00:02:54.440> really

minimus trail is the tendency when you

minimus trail is the tendency when you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
you're putting your foot and you if you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.400 
you're putting your foot and you if you
step<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.500> oddly<00:03:14.220> placed<00:03:14.840> rock<00:03:15.840> that's

there<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:21.030> between<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:23.130> more<00:03:23.370> reinforced

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
there in between the more reinforced

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.570 
there in between the more reinforced
lugs<00:03:25.550> you'll<00:03:26.550> actually<00:03:26.760> feel<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:28.170> rock

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
lugs you'll actually feel the rock

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.640 
lugs you'll actually feel the rock
through<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.090> sole<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.530> actually

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
through the sole and it can actually

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
through the sole and it can actually
hurt<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.160> bit<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.300> bit<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.570> trade-off

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
hurt a bit so it's a bit of a trade-off

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.190 
hurt a bit so it's a bit of a trade-off
where<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.250> excellent<00:03:35.840> ground<00:03:36.840> feel

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
where you get the excellent ground feel

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.340 
where you get the excellent ground feel
but<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:38.400> do<00:03:38.730> have<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.840> careful<00:03:40.320> than

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
but you do have to be more careful than

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.400 
but you do have to be more careful than
a<00:03:40.830> traditional<00:03:41.160> trail<00:03:41.670> shoe<00:03:42.410> they're

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
a traditional trail shoe they're

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.720 
a traditional trail shoe they're
incredibly<00:03:43.950> light<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.220> think<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.610> something

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
incredibly light I think it's something

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.030 
incredibly light I think it's something
like<00:03:44.850> four<00:03:45.180> point<00:03:45.390> three<00:03:45.480> ounces<00:03:46.910> super<00:03:47.910> light

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
like four point three ounces super light

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.300 
like four point three ounces super light
they're<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.250> excellent<00:03:51.030> shoe<00:03:52.100> they've<00:03:53.100> got

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310

a four mil four millimeter heel drop

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.570 
a four mil four millimeter heel drop
which<00:03:58.110> means<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.530> not<00:03:58.680> quite<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.070> zero<00:03:59.370> drop

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
which means it's not quite a zero drop

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.360 
which means it's not quite a zero drop
but<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.000> getting<00:04:00.269> fairly<00:04:00.690> close<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.370> more

first<00:05:16.360> couple<00:05:16.570> of<00:05:16.690> weeks<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:18.280> does<00:05:18.550> go<00:05:18.760> away<00:05:18.940> I

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
first couple of weeks it does go away I

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.930 
first couple of weeks it does go away I
think<00:05:19.600> with<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.200> change<00:05:20.500> in<00:05:20.889> your<00:05:21.220> form<00:05:21.550> and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
think with the change in your form and

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.450 
think with the change in your form and
change<00:05:22.450> in<00:05:22.630> your<00:05:22.750> running<00:05:22.900> technique<00:05:23.160> but<00:05:24.160> all

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
change in your running technique but all

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.240 
change in your running technique but all
I<00:05:24.490> will<00:05:24.729> say<00:05:24.940> is<00:05:24.970> that<00:05:25.120> you<00:05:25.720> should<00:05:26.410> be<00:05:26.770> fairly

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
I will say is that you should be fairly

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.570 
I will say is that you should be fairly
careful<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.930> could<00:05:29.530> hurt<00:05:29.770> yourself<00:05:30.220> but

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
careful and you could hurt yourself but

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.850 
careful and you could hurt yourself but
they<00:05:30.970> are<00:05:31.120> an<00:05:31.240> excellent<00:05:31.870> shoe<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.470> I

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
they are an excellent shoe and I

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.910 
they are an excellent shoe and I
recommend<00:05:33.280> them<00:05:33.340> really<00:05:33.580> highly
