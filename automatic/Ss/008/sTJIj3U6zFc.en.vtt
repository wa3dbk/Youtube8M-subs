00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
how many actual designs will there be

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.230 
how many actual designs will there be
there'll<00:00:46.840> be<00:00:47.020> 8<00:00:47.410> squares<00:00:47.950> designed<00:00:48.490> by<00:00:48.670> myself

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
there'll be 8 squares designed by myself

which<00:00:49.810> will<00:00:50.080> showcase<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.590> range<00:00:50.950> of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
which will showcase a range of

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.760 
which will showcase a range of
techniques<00:00:51.550> including<00:00:52.050> simple<00:00:53.050> cable<00:00:53.260> and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
techniques including simple cable and

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.740 
techniques including simple cable and
legs<00:00:54.040> so<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:54.790> guess<00:00:55.030> you're<00:00:55.210> going<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.390> take<00:00:55.570> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
legs so I guess you're going to take the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.050 
legs so I guess you're going to take the
knitter<00:00:56.020> on<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.320> journey<00:00:56.760> starting<00:00:57.760> from<00:00:57.940> the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
knitter on the journey starting from the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.540 
knitter on the journey starting from the
most<00:00:58.210> simplest<00:00:58.720> of<00:00:59.350> techniques<00:01:00.250> through

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
most simplest of techniques through

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.100 
most simplest of techniques through
tools<00:01:00.760> it's<00:01:01.030> slightly<00:01:01.210> more<00:01:01.420> complicated<00:01:01.750> one

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
tools it's slightly more complicated one

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.219 
tools it's slightly more complicated one
yes<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.770> that's<00:01:02.920> correct<00:01:03.190> yes<00:01:03.790> oh<00:01:04.199> wait<00:01:05.199> I

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
yes that that's correct yes oh wait I

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.810 
yes that that's correct yes oh wait I
did<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.909> how<00:01:07.180> many<00:01:07.240> actual<00:01:08.460> colorways<00:01:09.460> will

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
did so how many actual colorways will

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.289 
did so how many actual colorways will
you<00:01:10.030> be<00:01:10.180> doing<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:12.070> Afghan<00:01:12.460> has<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.759> total<00:01:13.240> of

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
you be doing the Afghan has a total of

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.649 
you be doing the Afghan has a total of
17<00:01:13.930> shades<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.590> pure<00:01:14.829> wool<00:01:15.100> worsted<00:01:15.310> yarn

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
17 shades of the pure wool worsted yarn

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.660 
17 shades of the pure wool worsted yarn
the<00:01:16.659> square<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.470> knitted<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:18.009> two<00:01:18.250> colorways

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
the square is knitted in two colorways

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.599 
the square is knitted in two colorways
and<00:01:19.179> you<00:01:19.960> get<00:01:20.139> three<00:01:20.409> squares<00:01:20.829> out<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.249> one

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
and you get three squares out of one

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.879 
and you get three squares out of one
wall<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.119> regret<00:01:22.450> balls<00:01:22.749> so<00:01:23.200> it's<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.590> very

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:23.889 
wall and regret balls so it's a very

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
wall and regret balls so it's a very
economical<00:01:24.310> net<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.859> I<00:01:26.859> guess<00:01:27.609> you<00:01:27.759> could

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
economical net and I guess you could

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.809 
economical net and I guess you could
also<00:01:28.119> do<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.509> in<00:01:28.990> one<00:01:29.499> solid<00:01:29.770> color<00:01:30.130> as<00:01:30.579> well

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
also do it in one solid color as well

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.349 
also do it in one solid color as well
you<00:01:31.359> could<00:01:31.659> yes<00:01:32.020> because<00:01:32.319> the<00:01:33.359> actual

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
you could yes because the actual

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.059 
you could yes because the actual
stitches<00:01:34.780> will<00:01:35.380> show<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.679> the<00:01:35.770> designs

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
stitches will show up the designs

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.419 
stitches will show up the designs
beautifully<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:36.939> just<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.359> colorway<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
beautifully in just the one colorway and

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.879 
beautifully in just the one colorway and
how<00:01:39.429> long<00:01:39.639> will<00:01:39.819> this<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.270> long<00:01:40.479> mouthful<00:01:41.109> the

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
how long will this is long mouthful the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.499 
how long will this is long mouthful the
knitter<00:01:42.100> long<00:01:42.340> will<00:01:42.549> actually<00:01:42.850> last<00:01:43.060> for<00:01:43.329> ten

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
knitter long will actually last for ten

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.899 
knitter long will actually last for ten
weeks<00:01:43.779> in<00:01:44.020> total<00:01:44.289> eight<00:01:44.920> weeks<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.700> the
