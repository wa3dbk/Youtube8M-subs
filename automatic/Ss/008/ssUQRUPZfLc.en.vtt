00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.420
 in March, upturned eyes to follow 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.070
 the solar eclipse 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.500
 the appointment is fixed time 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.789
 allowing for the morning of the 20th day 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 in which also falls the equinox of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 spring when the moon comes in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.570
 between the earth and our star 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490
 temporarily darkening it in Italy 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.859
 we will not see the totality of the phenomenon that 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 instead it will be observable on the Atlantic 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 northern on the islands far oer e 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.070
 from the svalbard islands 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 with us the solar disk will be darkened 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.780
 only in part and the percentage of this 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.790
 coverage will depend on latitude 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.070
 of the observer for example in Milan yes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.809
 will have a maximum coverage of 68 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 percent of the apparent diameter of the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.820
 sun while in Palermo you will not exceed the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.800
 50 percent for an observer from Rome 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 the moon will begin to cover the sun at 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 9 20 4 in the morning the maximum 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 the blackout will take place around 10 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.039
 and 40 while the phenomenon will end 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.379
 at 11 43 with the final release of 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.330
 our satellite from the solar disk these 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.010
 times vary by a few more minutes or 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.750
 in less to the vary of the places 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 Italians from where the eclipse is observed 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 we recommend never looking at the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 sun with the naked eye or worse 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.189
 looking at it directly with binoculars and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.320
 telescopes the risk is that of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.790
 permanently damage the view 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.470
 to follow the phenomenon throughout 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 safety better to wear the appropriate ones 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.369
 certified glasses for the eclipse that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.020
 you can find a small price in the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.119
 optical stores also avoiding 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.229
 DIY solutions 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.909
 let's now take a look at what 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.070
 we will be able to see the evening in the sky of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 March to the south it is possible to identify 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.200
 the lion the cancer the crater and the hydra 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.720
 the lower the lower dog the unicorn is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.430
 the major dog to the west stand out 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 constellations of the auriga twins 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.530
 of the bull and orion lower and lower towards 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.329
 north the constellation of the dragon cepheus 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.250
 cassiopea giraffe and big dipper 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.259
 rotate around the Pole Star 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 finally to the east they go up progressively 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.180
 the constellations of empty hercules and the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.890
 virgin with regard to the planets 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.460
 mercury will be very difficult to 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.409
 to observe 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.939
 at the beginning of the month you can try 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.020
 identify it very low on the horizon 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.090
 Oriental 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.069
 in the morning before sunrise 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.280
 with the passing of the days the planet does 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.560
 closer to our star 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.450
 making it impossible to observe it well 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 instead it continues to sparkle in the evening 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.370
 to the west and indeed increases in the month 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.720
 that its range of observability 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.000
 Mars still follows quite closely 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.770
 venere although lower and therefore shows 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.780
 similar observability conditions 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.340
 now Jupiter continues to remain well 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.069
 visible for most of the night too 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.720
 in March between south east and south west 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.550
 saturno increasingly anticipates his 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.260
 arising at the end of the month will be possible 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.150
 see it when it appears above 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.800
 the horizon in a southeastern direction already 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.680
 in the middle of the night for 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.730
 culminating in the south before dawn 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.650
 finally, let's remember some interesting ones 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.930
 conjunctions of the moon the night between 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.450
 2 and 3 March with Jupiter the night of 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.150
 11 and 12 with Saturn and the evening of 22 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.019
 with venus moon which will be full the 5 is 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.019
 new on the 20th
