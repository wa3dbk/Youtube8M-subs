00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you heard the clicks this is what it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080 
you heard the clicks this is what it
looks<00:02:12.240> like<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.960> far<00:02:12.990> with<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.850> said

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
looks like so far with it on like I said

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.660 
looks like so far with it on like I said
it<00:02:15.210> has<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.720> outer<00:02:15.990> protectant<00:02:16.740> already<00:02:17.160> so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
it has this outer protectant already so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.780 
it has this outer protectant already so
your<00:02:17.850> screen<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.510> covered<00:02:18.960> then<00:02:19.710> all<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> do<00:02:20.310> is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
your screen is covered then all I do is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.320 
your screen is covered then all I do is
I<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.000> slip<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.500> case<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.880> case<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
I just slip it in this case the case is

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.960 
I just slip it in this case the case is
not<00:02:24.510> hard<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.140> didn't<00:02:25.650> show<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.520> case<00:02:26.730> is

actually<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> rubber<00:02:28.080> case<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.370> not<00:02:29.520> hard

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
actually a rubber case so it's not hard

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.160 
actually a rubber case so it's not hard
I<00:02:30.120> thought<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> hard<00:02:30.720> case<00:02:30.900> when<00:02:31.110> I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
I thought it was a hard case when I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.450 
I thought it was a hard case when I
looked<00:02:31.350> at<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> computer<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.430> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
your speakers so that doesn't get

your speakers so that doesn't get
muffled<00:03:12.239> at<00:03:12.300> all<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.680> does<00:03:14.070> cover<00:03:14.459> up<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
muffled at all it it does cover up the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.090 
muffled at all it it does cover up the
power<00:03:15.570> button<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.230> volume<00:03:16.440> button<00:03:16.980> but

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
power button and the volume button but

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.550 
power button and the volume button but
that's<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> problem<00:03:17.640> because<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.180> still

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
that's not a problem because it's still

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
that's not a problem because it's still
react<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.100> touch<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:21.000> still<00:03:21.269> turns

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
react to it to touch and it still turns

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.490 
react to it to touch and it still turns
it<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:23.640> also<00:03:23.820> has<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> little<00:03:24.690> opening<00:03:24.989> here

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it on it also has a little opening here

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.210 
it on it also has a little opening here
for<00:03:25.830> your<00:03:26.420> headsets<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.650> think<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.130> is

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
for your headsets and I think that is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.440 
for your headsets and I think that is
about<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.760> another<00:03:29.850> opening<00:03:30.300> for

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
about it this is another opening for

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:58.190 
about it this is another opening for
your<00:03:30.540> speaker<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:56.660> it's<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.989> great

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
your speaker so it's just a great

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.960 
your speaker so it's just a great
protectant<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.010> looks<00:03:59.190> really<00:03:59.370> cool<00:03:59.700> and

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
protectant and it looks really cool and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.330 
protectant and it looks really cool and
it's<00:04:00.600> much<00:04:00.810> better<00:04:01.049> than<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.410> stupid<00:04:01.860> one<00:04:02.040> so

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
it's much better than this stupid one so

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.060 
it's much better than this stupid one so
if<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.970> have<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.390> get<00:04:04.350> rid<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.709> now<00:04:04.860> the
