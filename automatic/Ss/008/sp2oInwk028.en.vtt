die keen it's a very hard very accurate
plaster<00:04:23.990> essentially<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:24.889> what<00:04:25.700> we're<00:04:25.849> going

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
plaster essentially and what we're going

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.760 
plaster essentially and what we're going
to<00:04:26.000> do<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.300> mix<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.810> like<00:04:26.990> we<00:04:27.139> did<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.320> hydrocal

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
to do is mix it like we did the hydrocal

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.260 
to do is mix it like we did the hydrocal
and<00:04:28.250> then<00:04:28.340> we're<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.639> pour<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.060> in<00:04:29.150> the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and then we're going to pour it in the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.360 
and then we're going to pour it in the
negative<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:30.260> will<00:04:30.410> create<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.830> positive

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
negative and that will create a positive

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.170 
negative and that will create a positive
model<00:04:33.010> see<00:04:34.010> how<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.160> material<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.639> moving<00:04:35.060> and

good<00:06:04.139> build-up<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.860> on<00:06:05.039> these<00:06:05.189> because<00:06:05.400> this

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
good build-up to on these because this

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.300 
good build-up to on these because this

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
will probably get sunk in a base you

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.730 
will probably get sunk in a base you
want<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.550> make<00:06:08.639> sure<00:06:08.669> that<00:06:09.000> you<00:06:09.120> have<00:06:09.330> enough

any gum line or any of the teeth so you
want<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.430> build<00:06:14.969> it<00:06:15.180> up<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.360> little<00:06:15.689> bit<00:06:15.900> higher

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
want to build it up a little bit higher

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.680 
want to build it up a little bit higher
and<00:06:16.500> again<00:06:17.009> you<00:06:17.099> can<00:06:17.250> always<00:06:17.370> carve<00:06:17.789> down<00:06:18.060> the

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
and again you can always carve down the

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:32.390 
and again you can always carve down the
time<00:06:18.960> comes<00:06:19.169> a<00:06:19.259> lipid<00:06:19.530> set<00:06:30.979> and<00:06:31.979> just<00:06:32.009> again

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
time comes a lipid set and just again

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.830 
time comes a lipid set and just again
just<00:06:32.580> very<00:06:32.819> carefully<00:06:33.060> peel<00:06:33.599> away<00:06:33.750> and<00:06:35.840> there

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
just very carefully peel away and there

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.170 
just very carefully peel away and there
is<00:06:37.139> our<00:06:37.319> girls<00:06:37.590> teeth<00:06:40.370> so<00:06:41.370> you<00:06:41.430> can<00:06:41.580> see<00:06:41.789> -<00:06:42.029> we

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
is our girls teeth so you can see - we

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.350 
is our girls teeth so you can see - we
got<00:06:42.330> all<00:06:42.479> the<00:06:43.310> gum<00:06:44.310> information<00:06:44.669> a<00:06:45.120> little

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
got all the gum information a little

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.939 
got all the gum information a little
muscle<00:06:45.689> it's<00:06:46.050> like<00:06:46.229> right<00:06:46.379> between<00:06:46.529> the<00:06:46.800> teeth

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
muscle it's like right between the teeth

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.129 
muscle it's like right between the teeth
that's<00:06:47.129> all<00:06:47.279> important<00:06:47.759> to<00:06:47.819> have<00:06:48.050> because<00:06:49.050> you

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
that's all important to have because you

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.480 
that's all important to have because you
got<00:06:49.259> to<00:06:49.349> account<00:06:49.650> for<00:06:49.770> that<00:06:49.949> when<00:06:50.159> you<00:06:50.250> do<00:06:50.370> your

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
got to account for that when you do your

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.790 
got to account for that when you do your
sculpture<00:06:50.969> and<00:06:51.180> that'll<00:06:51.900> settle<00:06:52.259> sink<00:06:52.560> in<00:06:52.710> the

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
sculpture and that'll settle sink in the

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.879 
sculpture and that'll settle sink in the
base<00:06:53.150> like<00:06:54.150> so<00:06:55.430> get<00:06:56.430> this<00:06:56.550> out<00:06:56.789> of<00:06:56.819> the<00:06:56.909> way

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:00.889 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.409 

you<00:07:01.889> also<00:07:02.039> want<00:07:02.310> to<00:07:02.339> be<00:07:02.490> aware<00:07:02.669> that<00:07:03.150> you<00:07:03.270> don't

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419
