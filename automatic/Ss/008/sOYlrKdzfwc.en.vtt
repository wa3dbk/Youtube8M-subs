a<00:02:13.099> lot<00:02:13.489> of<00:02:13.579> these<00:02:13.640> people<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.060> are<00:02:14.150> putting

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
a lot of these people that are putting

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.429 
a lot of these people that are putting
out<00:02:14.510> videos<00:02:14.540> saying<00:02:15.079> there's<00:02:15.200> gonna<00:02:15.290> be

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
out videos saying there's gonna be

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.259 
out videos saying there's gonna be
zombies<00:02:15.829> in<00:02:15.950> advanced<00:02:16.310> warfare<00:02:16.670> not<00:02:16.909> to<00:02:17.060> bash

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
zombies in advanced warfare not to bash

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.599 
zombies in advanced warfare not to bash
anybody<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.590> they're<00:02:18.890> doing<00:02:19.219> it<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.519> the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
anybody but they're doing it for the

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.670 
anybody but they're doing it for the
views<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.120> advanced<00:02:20.810> warfare<00:02:20.930> will<00:02:21.500> not

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
views so advanced warfare will not

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.289 
views so advanced warfare will not
feature<00:02:21.950> zombies<00:02:22.549> but<00:02:22.700> then<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.000> leads<00:02:23.150> into

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
feature zombies but then that leads into

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.539 
feature zombies but then that leads into
the<00:02:23.450> next<00:02:23.510> question<00:02:24.049> what<00:02:24.620> will<00:02:24.859> it<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:25.189> again

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
the next question what will it be again

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.819 
the next question what will it be again
at<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:25.879> point<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.719> literally<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.379> no

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
at this point I'm we literally have no

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.920 
at this point I'm we literally have no
hints<00:02:28.129> or<00:02:28.250> anything<00:02:28.760> towards<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.450> co-op<00:02:29.720> mode

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
hints or anything towards the co-op mode

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.750 
hints or anything towards the co-op mode
we<00:02:30.049> don't<00:02:30.079> have<00:02:30.349> anything<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.980> firmly<00:02:31.370> grasp

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
we don't have anything to firmly grasp

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.149 
we don't have anything to firmly grasp
on<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.239> look<00:02:32.480> at<00:02:32.659> it<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.109> yo<00:02:33.439> this

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
on and look at it and be like yo this

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.369 
on and look at it and be like yo this
could<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.579> anything<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:35.239> my<00:02:35.870> thoughts<00:02:36.200> and

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
could be anything so my thoughts and

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.500 
could be anything so my thoughts and
personal<00:02:36.859> opinions<00:02:37.220> are<00:02:37.400> just<00:02:37.849> as<00:02:38.000> valid<00:02:38.030> as

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
personal opinions are just as valid as

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.750 
personal opinions are just as valid as
yours<00:02:38.840> anything<00:02:39.620> could<00:02:40.010> go<00:02:40.040> with<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.549> we

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
yours anything could go with this we

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.000 
yours anything could go with this we
have<00:02:40.879> no<00:02:41.180> idea<00:02:41.359> like<00:02:42.109> I've<00:02:42.230> said<00:02:42.290> before<00:02:42.500> my

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
have no idea like I've said before my

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.199 
have no idea like I've said before my
personal<00:02:43.459> thoughts<00:02:43.639> that<00:02:43.849> it's<00:02:43.969> going<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.150> be

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
personal thoughts that it's going to be

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.000 
personal thoughts that it's going to be
something<00:02:44.420> along<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.989> lines<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.409> cyborgs

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
something along the lines of cyborgs

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.949 
something along the lines of cyborgs
just<00:02:46.159> because<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.489> implementation<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:47.540> so

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
just because of the implementation of so

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.080 
just because of the implementation of so
much<00:02:48.139> technology<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.189> exosuits<00:02:49.909> in

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
much technology and the exosuits in

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.940 
much technology and the exosuits in
advanced<00:02:50.450> warfare<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.319> me<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:51.769> very

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
advanced warfare to me it's just very

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.409 
advanced warfare to me it's just very
plausible<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:52.790> type<00:02:53.030> of<00:02:53.060> thing<00:02:53.299> could

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
plausible that that type of thing could

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.970 
plausible that that type of thing could
happen<00:02:53.599> especially<00:02:53.840> with<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.590> things<00:02:54.829> that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
happen especially with the things that

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.500 
happen especially with the things that
we've<00:02:55.069> seen<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.280> michel<00:02:55.790> gondry<00:02:56.120> tweet<00:02:56.359> out

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
we've seen from michel gondry tweet out

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.539 
we've seen from michel gondry tweet out
just<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.169> give<00:02:57.290> hints<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:57.859> there<00:02:58.040> he<00:02:58.370> has

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
just to give hints here and there he has

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.819 
just to give hints here and there he has
put<00:02:58.790> out<00:02:58.879> articles<00:02:59.120> relating<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.019> cyborgs<00:03:00.739> and

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
put out articles relating to cyborgs and

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.740 
put out articles relating to cyborgs and
the<00:03:00.950> implementation<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.849> so<00:03:02.180> much<00:03:02.329> technology

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
the implementation of so much technology

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.300 
the implementation of so much technology
in<00:03:03.079> our<00:03:03.169> lives<00:03:03.409> that<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.680> aren't<00:03:04.159> actually

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
in our lives that we aren't actually

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.940 
in our lives that we aren't actually
what<00:03:05.180> we<00:03:05.299> would<00:03:05.450> call<00:03:05.599> human<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:06.470> partially

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
what we would call human but partially

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.890 
what we would call human but partially
half<00:03:07.159> technology<00:03:07.669> and<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.209> that<00:03:08.329> case<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.810> can

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
half technology and in that case it can

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.050 
half technology and in that case it can
be<00:03:09.049> very<00:03:09.290> dangerous<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:09.950> articles<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:10.819> that

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
be very dangerous so articles like that

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.059 
be very dangerous so articles like that
not<00:03:11.569> only<00:03:11.689> catch<00:03:12.019> my<00:03:12.230> attention<00:03:12.260> but<00:03:12.829> also

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
not only catch my attention but also

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.640 
not only catch my attention but also
spark<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:13.760> imagination<00:03:13.849> here<00:03:14.810> for<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.470> game

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
spark the imagination here for the game

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.710 
spark the imagination here for the game
and<00:03:15.680> what<00:03:16.040> we<00:03:16.129> could<00:03:16.430> see<00:03:16.669> but<00:03:16.939> along<00:03:17.569> the

that I think is the bigger topic that we
have<00:03:21.919> more<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.430> grasp<00:03:22.699> on<00:03:22.940> actually<00:03:23.419> in<00:03:23.599> terms
