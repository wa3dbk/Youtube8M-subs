bolt that you shoot and then it explodes

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.939 
bolt that you shoot and then it explodes
will<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> same<00:00:53.219> same<00:00:53.760> scenario<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.949> when

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
will the same same scenario here when

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.380 
will the same same scenario here when
you<00:00:56.070> shoot<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.850> zombies<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.239> all

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
attracted to it and and then it explodes
but<00:01:00.329> again<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.780> believe<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
but again I believe you have to have it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
but again I believe you have to have it
upgraded<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:03.059> only<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
upgraded not only do you have to have it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
upgraded not only do you have to have it
upgraded<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.159> upgrade<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> twice<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
upgraded so you can upgrade it twice it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550 
upgraded so you can upgrade it twice it
looks<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
looks like now we have to I want to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.760 
looks like now we have to I want to
verify<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> looks<00:01:10.260> as

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
verify this because you know it looks as

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
verify this because you know it looks as
though<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.189> appears<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.760> though<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> get
