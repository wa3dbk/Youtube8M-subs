Welcome back on our series on how to tie tie
knots!

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.430
Today, I'm going to show you to tie the Kelvin
knot.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:22.870
Basically, the Kelvin knot is just like the
oriental when you loop the long end once around

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.970
more.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.910
That creates a bigger knot for more volume
and a slightly different look in terms of

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.910
size.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.050
Here, I'm wearing a navy blue jacquard tie
from Fort Belvedere and it's rather substantial,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.530
it's heavy Italian silk and so the knot gets
even bigger than with a thinner tie.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.060
Normally, it can still work with collar pins,
in case you choose a thick tie like this one,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.719
I would recommend you use an oriental knot
or a four in hand knot just to keep the knot

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.770
smaller.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.750
The Kelvin Knot is like the Oriental and you
want the sewn side up.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.300
To start, you have the slim end is gonna be
much shorter about one and a half hands above

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:19.680
your waistband . So slim end, like so and
now you loop it around half and then you tighten,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.409
you pinch it with your fingers and now you
go around once more, so one more loop and

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:35.909
now you take the wide end, you come through
from the back here, pull it tight and get

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.100
it through the knot.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.780
Here, you just want to go through the last
layer, not both layers.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.780
Just the last layer you create with your knot,
you hold it, place gently and pull through

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.940
like so.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:00.630
Now you want your little dimple in there,
pinch and just pull.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.970
Once you're ready, you pull on the short end
slightly, adjust it until you like the look.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.009
Voila!

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.120
The Kelvin knot.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.890
With a thick tie like this one, I prefer kind
of a medium spread to cutaway collar, you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.200
can see here it kind of accentuates the shoulders
in a way and it's wide enough to accommodate

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.879
a bigger knot like that.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.069
Use a thinner tie, probably a medium spread
is ideal but I would not recommend wearing

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.360
really strong cutaways and classic collars
may work if it's thinner.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.910
If it's a little bit thicker, you may run
into troubles but just test it and see what

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.450
works best for you.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.430
Basically, you want to expose a knot and not
cover it up by your collar.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.200
