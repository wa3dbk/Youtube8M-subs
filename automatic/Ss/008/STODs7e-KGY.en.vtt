automatically<00:00:49.500> started<00:00:50.100> controlling<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
automatically started controlling it I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.580 
automatically started controlling it I

time<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:58.980> maybe<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.149> you're<00:01:00.510> able<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
time but maybe not so now you're able to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
time but maybe not so now you're able to
navigate<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.850> settings<00:01:03.270> you'll<00:01:03.420> need<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
navigate to the settings you'll need to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
navigate to the settings you'll need to
navigate<00:01:03.809> obviously<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> settings<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
navigate obviously to the settings and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.410 
navigate obviously to the settings and
change<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.750> network<00:01:09.590> like<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.680> said<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.420> don't

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
change your network like I said we don't

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
change your network like I said we don't
have<00:01:12.590> we're<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
have we're all we can use here as a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
have we're all we can use here as a
mobile<00:01:15.150> hotspot<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.720> no<00:01:15.869> internet

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
mobile hotspot there's no internet

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
mobile hotspot there's no internet
access<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.790> why<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.150> had<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
access so that's why we had to do it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.429 
access so that's why we had to do it
like<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.070> jump<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:20.460> general

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
like this you just jump into general

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.510 
like this you just jump into general
just<00:01:22.439> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.650> show<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> steps<00:01:23.310> here

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
just kind of show you the steps here

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
just kind of show you the steps here
real<00:01:23.700> quick<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.979> network<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.110> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
real quick and network we see it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
real quick and network we see it's
connected<00:01:28.619> under<00:01:28.860> guest<00:01:29.159> guest<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> name

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
connected under guest guest is the name

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
connected under guest guest is the name
of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> mobile<00:01:30.840> hotspot<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> galaxy<00:01:32.130> s4

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
of the mobile hotspot on the galaxy s4

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
of the mobile hotspot on the galaxy s4
and<00:01:34.430> there<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.670> would<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.030> connect<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and there you would just connect to that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.840 
and there you would just connect to that
Wi-Fi<00:01:38.040> network<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.049> from<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.850> can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Wi-Fi network and from then on I can

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
Wi-Fi network and from then on I can
obviously<00:01:42.240> watch<00:01:42.450> Netflix<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.229> things<00:01:43.470> like

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
obviously watch Netflix and things like

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.580 
obviously watch Netflix and things like
that<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:45.180> also<00:01:45.409> mirror<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.829> iPhone

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
that but I can also mirror my iPhone

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.429 
that but I can also mirror my iPhone
whatever<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> watch<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:51.439> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
whatever I want to watch on there so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.770 
whatever I want to watch on there so
that's<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.430> alternative<00:01:53.520> way<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.600> need

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that's one alternative way you do need

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
that's one alternative way you do need
galaxy<00:01:55.200> s4<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:57.619> phone<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:59.130> infrared<00:02:00.119> light

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
galaxy s4 or a phone with infrared light

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
galaxy s4 or a phone with infrared light
I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> only<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.619> though<00:02:01.829> but

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I think that's the only one though but

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.830 
I think that's the only one though but
there<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.479> mirror<00:02:03.840> into<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:05.270> TV<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
there it is mirror into the TV now so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.779 
there it is mirror into the TV now so
we're<00:02:07.259> good<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.550> thanks

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
we're good to go and that's that thanks

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.209 
we're good to go and that's that thanks
for<00:02:08.910> watching
