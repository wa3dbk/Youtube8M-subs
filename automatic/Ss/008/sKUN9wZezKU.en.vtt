00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
prolific is very different he was the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080

only<00:02:04.289> honest<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.890> knew<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.520> thought<00:02:05.759> at

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
only honest I knew there was thought at

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
only honest I knew there was thought at
the<00:02:06.210> top<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.840> he<00:02:07.380> would<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.740> rough<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the top and he would not rough out the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
the top and he would not rough out the
drawing<00:02:08.789> he<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.149> started<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.690> line<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
drawing he just started one line it

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.350 
drawing he just started one line it
finished<00:02:10.440> off<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.709> drawing<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.730> amazing

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
finished off a drawing which is amazing

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360 
finished off a drawing which is amazing
I<00:02:12.510> could<00:02:12.720> never<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.470> he<00:02:14.280> was

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
I could never do that and he was

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.940 
I could never do that and he was
extremely<00:02:14.640> fast<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.570> he<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.290> different

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
extremely fast and he was different

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.520 
extremely fast and he was different
Jack<00:02:17.580> was<00:02:17.790> very<00:02:17.850> different<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.319> think

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
Jack was very different and I think

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.990 
Jack was very different and I think
