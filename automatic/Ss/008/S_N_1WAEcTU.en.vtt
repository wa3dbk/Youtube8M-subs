00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.340
 hi guys they are meat and drink says it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.870
 which defeats for this new video 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.910
 with whom I speak so for a moment to 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 flight of the new map in version 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.900
 shanghai night that is possible 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 test on the ct and for the exact name 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 which was given to the map infiltration 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.019
 of shanghai and between a great and I will explain 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.930
 because it is called infiltration where not 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.449
 shanghai knight version cocks and decks 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 then that of night maps is not 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 undoubtedly an innovation 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.820
 extraordinary that they are testing now 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
 the boys of the adise on the ct and why 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 I say this but because there are always 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.649
 been the night maps were in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 battlefield 2 I remember them at 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.489
 perfection also in battlefield 3 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.620
 one out of all guys that surely is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.350
 you will remember tehran highway and yes 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.079
 he played at night what he did without 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 doubt a novelty is that here and night for 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.800
 I mean, I didn't see a bat there 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.270
 the chessa 5 6 meters opponent does not 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.059
 see also why the 3d spot is 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.129
 completely off disabled and me 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.660
 seems fair if no blanket of spots was 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 however, there is no other story 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.170
 be the 2 spot or the one on one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.880
 minimal overlooks you can move a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.930
 enemy that you find yourself only in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.400
 minimum of entity 3d triangles that wander 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 a medium if not it would really be in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.909
 Christmas tree map is called 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 infiltration of shanghai and here we come 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 the beauty of the video because this one in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.740
 reality is not one with this classic but 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 it is a conquest 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.150
 assault maybe so many of you following 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 also comments below the videos that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.540
 we publish will have noticed that more 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.159
 I once mentioned this mode 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 that was the queen mode of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.939
 battlefield in the first fight is not yes 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.439
 he played with these now but yes 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.570
 played or won assault ho 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.770
 conquered more assault than it was with 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.329
 I'm doing this short assault 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 see who's leaving now who 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.439
 attack that has the deployment so there is one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.299
 base that you can't capture where I am 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.979
 I can always play until I know 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.479
 finished getter and must attack 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.280
 the opponent instead of all 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.720
 faint zero flegma cialde flight to 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.040
 that is all the flags but it does not have the deployment 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.049
 this is the heart of the matter 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.850
 obviously the cool thing which was which 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.680
 the attacker could conquer all 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.479
 the flags and therefore not allowed anymore 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.990
 to spawn opponent ergo areas 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.160
 game ended for the cover ended 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.509
 maybe even after five minutes because 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
 they took all the flags and I didn't 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.830
 I can break through anywhere 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 just ended 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.850
 all just end game over and it was 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.130
 beautiful because this mode here 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.200
 in fact everyone had another pepper 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.240
 those that come to me say carrano 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.010
 when he says cool guard line because he has it 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.650
 the best structured maps according to you 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.270
 because we say the points of interest are 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.520
 also better connected flex or more 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.780
 neighbors so I can move on foot is 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.490
 bullshit because I used to play a 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 battlefield web in battlefield 2 le 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.690
 maps were gigantic yes you my son 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.700
 you are right but in eu battlefield not 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.520
 you played classic conquest you played 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.080
 conquest assault or double conquest 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.090
 assault which is a variant of this which 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.700
 can explained and it was another 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.720
 history guys why take a flag 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.660
 or lose it 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 it was really a mess and then the maps 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.530
 among other things they were structured in a way 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.420
 different because they were rectangular 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.150
 they had a front line they were not 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.220
 large and circular maps with minchiam sta 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.120
 in fact, in fact, that they were made 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.770
 very beautifull 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200
 the fact is that I have tested it and I have 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.910
 4 5 match played on the cover I 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.850
 seen with binoculars because anyway 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.709
 this gigantic new one also hurt 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.360
 if they gave it a fix they have 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.190
 tried to fix it in this one 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.260
 night version and therefore essentially 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.180
 there is no time for guys to go to 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.769
 conquer all the flags to the opponent 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.120
 because anyway I conquer them 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.730
 conquer another there will surely be 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.430
 an area of ​​the map where flag e 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.230
 the opponent manages to relocate there 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.209
 you didn't understand us but a bat but who 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.459
 I don't care then I told myself anyway 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.380
 nothing is seen and this is one thing 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.510
 fantastic is obviously you can 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.739
 equip your weapon or with 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.790
 infrared or with thermal but not 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.469
 it's not so easy to use 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.930
 anyway i don't take it with 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.489
 nothing because when he disappeared with the heat 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.590
 for example the flame will cover you 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.239
 all the chaste heat and from the weapon e 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.920
 so you see nothing is right 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.799
 because it's really realistic that way 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.290
 however it is much more complicated to shoot us 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.030
 but it was fun to play without it 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.340
 doubt I told you it was also executed 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.379
 a restyling instead of the structure 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.889
 of the map in fact it cannot be climbed on 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.299
 no roof and this is one of the things 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.560
 good news from them in fact 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.810
 noticing and this I do not say i 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.549
 you guys look at the eyes is costri 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.099
 understanding what are the mistakes he has 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.699
 commited clamorous in battlefield 4 la 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:29.580
 location of the players on the dimension 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.770
 vertical ie allowing a player 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.590
 in this case a camperone sniper 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.690
 to stand 100 meters high from the jack 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.849
 who walks will hold a big crap 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.530
 guys sucks this thing made 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.970
 shanghai and is not the first time and apple tree 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.789
 to hear you say sorry I was breaking up 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.320
 the headphones about battlefield 4 ceo 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.789
 of bill and that is you really if you want to do 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.349
 a massacre go on shanghai with 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.970
 you find the helicopter so much there 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.770
 above them and kill all via ie and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.510
 ridiculous that people have fun at 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.830
 put yourself with a 40 towards a building e 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.960
 then maybe the same one that does write 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.169
 north but in crap because they are not there 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.490
 skyscrapers leave for these are 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.199
 things I will never understand guys have 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.570
 never let you have fun putting yourself at 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.610
 spammare liar just want pg from a 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.199
 skyscraper, that is to say but not like us 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.330
 really arrival at the skyscraper 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.159
 Shanghai some of the worst maps 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.560
 structured than ever before 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.330
 conceived by the dyt team absurd though 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.800
 having said this however this map here as 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.199
 I've already told you it's not bad at all 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.840
 sure that they will take it into the game 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.520
 in short , you will play the standard vanilla 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.110
 many because the fact is fun 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.419
 precisely that nothing is seen and that 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.820
 you have to fight with this one 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.560
 what in short is all dark e 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.630
 also strategically changes 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.099
 strongly the last thing gameplay does not 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.300
 I know if I said it to the video I am 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.370
 forget about a moment but there is a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.620
 generator this would be the evolution 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.349
 which is present in the map that goes 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.270
 turn on and off certain icons 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.560
 in short, the lights are when 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.810
 they are lit up as you see in this 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.250
 moment from the images we see everything a 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.050
 better in some areas of the map 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.270
 this is the evolution let's say it is 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.190
 was introduced in this version of 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.419
 shanghai I said all the rest I hope 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.470
 that you enjoyed the video if so 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.850
 left like 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.850
 called to the next bye
