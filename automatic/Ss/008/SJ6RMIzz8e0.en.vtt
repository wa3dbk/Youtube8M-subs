want to serve you want to basically go

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.010 
want to serve you want to basically go
to<00:00:30.520> where<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.760> says<00:00:30.910> mail<00:00:31.240> contacts<00:00:31.869> and

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
to where it says mail contacts and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.040 
to where it says mail contacts and
calendars<00:00:32.109> tap<00:00:32.829> on<00:00:33.039> that<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.449> then<00:00:34.449> scroll

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
calendars tap on that and then scroll

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.169 
calendars tap on that and then scroll
down<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.469> bottom<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:36.550> where<00:00:36.789> it<00:00:36.909> says

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
down to the bottom to where it says

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.899 
down to the bottom to where it says
signature<00:00:38.159> and<00:00:39.159> we're<00:00:39.309> going<00:00:39.429> to<00:00:39.460> tap<00:00:39.699> on

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
signature and we're going to tap on

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.290 
signature and we're going to tap on
signature<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.920> right<00:00:42.819> now<00:00:42.850> it's<00:00:43.210> a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
signature and so right now it's a

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.910 
signature and so right now it's a
blanket<00:00:43.809> so<00:00:43.929> what<00:00:44.079> that<00:00:44.109> means<00:00:44.409> is<00:00:44.469> whenever<00:00:44.739> I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
blanket so what that means is whenever I

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.759 
blanket so what that means is whenever I
send<00:00:45.190> an<00:00:45.249> email<00:00:45.429> I<00:00:45.909> won't<00:00:46.659> see<00:00:46.870> anything<00:00:47.170> at

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
send an email I won't see anything at

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.919 
send an email I won't see anything at
