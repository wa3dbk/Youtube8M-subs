00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:14.380
 [Music] 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.250
 I wanted to return to the army since 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.660
 little unfortunately the life 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.940
 current fact that we do not necessarily 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.160
 what we want so I have 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.539
 privileged studies I was lucky 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.680
 to have a job in stride so 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.409
 well I worked and there was 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.359
 still the military side that 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.969
 was missing and so the reserve is 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.909
 really that's really the area that 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.530
 I chose for precisely and to make up for my 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.079
 professional and military privacy 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.460
 [Applause] 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.969
 I already learned about the internet 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.289
 have kept a little bit of what was being done 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.510
 Then I called directly 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.979
 regiment the navy troops that are going 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.809
 in fact not far from home 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.519
 me and then they gave me all 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.290
 the steps to follow to be able to 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.040
 so engage me 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.040
 [Applause] 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.150
 then the future roughly speaking is the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.640
 reservist classes 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.850
 we first learn the basics on 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.350
 weapons handling respect the ranks 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.420
 we really learn really really 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.250
 the b to ba of the military in the future lasts 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.290
 about two weeks in a fortnight 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.530
 it's done directly for us 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.050
 case in the regiment sharing and mutual help 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.170
 [Applause] 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.510
 on average I do about thirty 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.210
 and forty days that I advise 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.340
 really to the army of course it's 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.950
 flexible according to my private life 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.990
 and my professional life is thus 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.930
 demands of the army so after these 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.690
 sets on 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.480
 we have a provisional schedule and then 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.480
 we manage it day by day what 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.920
 I started already a little bit after 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.800
 see my schedule I suspected that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 at risk and be on the alert 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.580
 is the case so I had planned a small 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.009
 little my light schedule more manage 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.400
 with my entourage and my wife in particular 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.310
 kim and pretty well so once that 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.040
 the call was launched I could with this 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.000
 small this little forecast balance I 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.000
 managed at best 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.830
