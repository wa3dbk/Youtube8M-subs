00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.420
 summer is slowly catching up with us 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.950
 And so does the time we get 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.490
 with our smartphone outside 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.200
 spend 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.929
 That's why we wanted to test today 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
 like amulet or lcd panels in the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.690
 Comparison with direct 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.580
 show solar radiation 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.340
 for that we have the Samsung Galaxy S 4 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.900
 and the htc evo accepted around the two 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 devices have to be compared 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.519
 Of course, we first increase the brightness 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 100 percent 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.910
 after we did that, we see 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.100
 First of all, we see almost nothing 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 Both displays are so bright that ours 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.760
 Camera definitely has problems 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 content is still good 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 a look in the apple shows the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.520
 closed rooms are the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 Differences between amulet and lcd 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.899
 minimal that htc when is something lighter 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 as the galaxy s 4 in both are the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.520
 content but very good and bright 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.140
 if we in the browser our website 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 android pit.de will open the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.399
 differentiate a little more clearly that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.109
 However, Htc Bahn clearly has its nose 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 front in terms of brightness 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 the same result is also evident 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.439
 a little test with the software 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.610
 google maps here is the htc when 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 clearly in front 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.170
 But that was just the prelude to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.820
 see what the two display types will be 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.729
 you do not have to go out and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 we did that 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.970
 when the sun bangs from the sky 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.009
 to be a shady cookie around 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.530
 Smart to operate smartphone 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 but lcd really has an advantage here 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.619
 opposite amoled our test shows in the app 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.570
 store is still in order 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.119
 browser looks quite different 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.210
 the htc when still white tones 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.159
 definitely knows that it tends to four 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.689
 By contrast, the gray ones are already 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.130
 has gone and a quick look 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.229
 be on the map at google maps 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.450
 is also here with the htc one and 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.560
 his lcd display a bit better served 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.110
 as with the amulet of it four 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.380
 but the real acid test comes 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.240
 now direct sunlight 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.399
 Both phones have bad cards here 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.170
 if you do not close your eyes 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.210
 and look closely you can almost recognize 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.619
 nothing the displays seem almost black 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.019
 but that's no wonder 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.060
 the sun pops right on it the 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.769
 LCD panel from HTC man with his 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.900
 Backlight plays here but 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.760
 its advantage from readability and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.740
 Brightness is significantly better than when 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.660
 amoled from galaxy s 4 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.670
 the result of our small test 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.080
 should be clear who much outside 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.970
 is on the way and not be on it 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.580
 smartphone would rather do without 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.630
 take one with lcd screen or he 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.630
 just goes to the shadows
