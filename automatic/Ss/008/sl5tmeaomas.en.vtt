00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.629
 chapter 12 of the Apocalypse speaks of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.990
 respect of a pure woman 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.660
 it symbolizes the church of christ 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
 in contrast in chapter 17 of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 apocalypse 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.560
 we have a prostitute a whore 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 these churches are in position 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 antagonistic 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.339
 today we will know a little more about 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.339
 respect of the fall of the great harlot 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.770
 hello friends, welcome again 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.409
 to the study of the book of the apocalypse 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 today we are going to study about the fall of 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 great whore 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.640
 I wanted to invite you to read with me. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:32.159
 apocalypse in chapter 17 versus 3 and 4 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.679
 transported my angel in spirit to a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.100
 desert and I saw a woman riding a 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.369
 This scarlet beast is full of names. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 of blasphemy with seven heads and 10 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.179
 horns 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.959
 he thought the woman was dressed in purple and 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.979
 dial tin adorned with gold of stones 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.679
 precious stones and pearls with a 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.130
 golden cup overflowing with 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:03.090
 abominations and with the uncleanness of his 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.770
 prostitution versus 5 on their forehead 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 thought is inscribed the name of a mystery 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.359
 Babylon there is great 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.519
 the mother of harlots and abominations 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:18.900
 of the earth apocalypse 17 deals with the fall of 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.329
 great beatriz 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.239
 today we are going to study about a movement 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.840
 religion that has turned away from purity 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.579
 doctrine of the apostles and corrupted 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.590
 other churches with their false doctrines 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.280
 we believe that God has two churches in this 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.579
 Earth 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.109
 the visible church and the invisible church 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.600
 We already studied here about the 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.780
 characteristics that identify the church 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.750
 visible in chapter 12 of apocalypse 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.810
 the invisible church is made up of children 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.250
 sincere of God who are present in 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.440
 all interesting churches is that god 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.100
 have a special invitation to your children 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.260
 that are in these denominations we will see 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.269
 this invitation 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.959
 we read here in the bible concerning the name 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.530
 Babylon Babylon Means Confusion 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.709
 this name originated at the time when 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.069
 9- year old doubts about the promises 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.430
 god that no more destroy the planet 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.459
 through a deluge to try to escape the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.280
 a possible thaw, I saw the people who 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.249
 they lived at that time to build a tower 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.090
 to try to reach the heavens with 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:37.319
 she but god they will not meet 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.469
 your promise 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.620
 so let us guard against Babylon 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:45.659
 therefore it is a symbol of rebellion and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.700
 represents those who abandon 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.969
 purity of the word of god 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.049
 in exchange for the wine of false doctrines of 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.810
 Babylon 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.419
 if in chapter 12 apocalipse we have 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.139
 a pure woman representing the church is 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.530
 true 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:04.469
 here in chapter 17 this prostitute she 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.949
 represents the fallen church that with its 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.239
 false doctrines leads to drunken 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:12.379
 kings of the earth 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.989
 In this context the wine here symbolizes 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:19.199
 false doctrines are the doctrines or 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.669
 the dogmas of paganism that gradually 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.320
 infiltrating the Christian church 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.500
 some true doctrines like 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.810
 Saturday was replaced by Sunday and 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.169
 others also began to believe in the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.710
 purgatory worship of saints 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.050
 the veneration of images and other things 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.500
 that came from paganism and infiltrated 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.900
 inside the Christian church but God has a 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.169
 invitation to all your sincere 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.949
 even within Babylon in this invitation 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.159
 appears in chapter 18 in verse 4 when 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:05:00.270
 God says so there was another voice from heaven 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:03.210
 saying, take ye out from them my people to 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.380
 not be accomplices in their sins and 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.380
 not to participate in their flagellates 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.800
 God is here making an appeal to all 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.740
 sincere son and daughter independent of 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.620
 place you are but you want to join 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.020
 to the church that keeps the commandments 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.889
 God and believe in all truths 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.620
 taught by this book 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.919
 yes we must seek to understand the 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.740
 God's will for our lives and caring 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.979
 so that the wines of Babylon do not 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.400
 come to deceive us or turn us away 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:44.210
 of the pure truth taught in the word of 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.669
 Christ, my friend, and you, we are today. 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.210
 invite us to join the church that 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.819
 practice the truth of the word of God and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.430
 to leave Babylon, which is yes in 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.539
 rebellion against God and against His 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.419
 truth 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.629
 Throughout history God has always had a 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:05.539
 persecuted people. 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.029
 cause of these truths but you and me 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.699
 Today we can choose to be on our side. 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:14.270
 right on the side of truth 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:17.779
 open your heart to Christ now take the 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.680
 decision to follow the whole truth as 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:24.560
 is in his word Christ promised that 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.589
 when the Holy Spirit came to him 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.469
 would lead to the whole truth 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:33.680
 the spirit does not lead us to truths 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:36.650
 partial but the whole truth 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.469
 This means that the doctrines that 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.250
 modern Christianity has stepped into the 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:45.500
 true that many have not followed 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:49.009
 Babylon is spreading its 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.009
 wine in all directions and you and I 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.199
 we need to guard against 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.620
 Satan's tricks 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.669
 so open your heart now and take 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.949
 the decision to join the pure church 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:07.129
 represented in the apocalypse 12 in a 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.930
 verse 17 he has a strong message 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:14.360
 for me for you 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:17.419
 apocalypse 1217 says go or if the dragon 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.149
 against the woman and went to fight with 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:23.060
 remaining of their offspring those who 

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:25.039
 keep the commandments of God and have the 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.939
 testimony of jesus 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:32.419
 here are the sincere people of god those 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:36.050
 who keep the commandments of God and the 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:37.249
 testimony of Jesus take your 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.279
 decision 

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:42.169
 join the people who wish to remain faithful 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:46.239
 The word of God 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:48.109
 If this is your wish, pray with me now. 

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:50.619
 holy fathers 

00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:53.959
 Thank you for the truth of your word 

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:58.189
 Thank you because we can meet and 

00:07:53.959 --> 00:08:00.649
 practice what your law teaches us 

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:03.529
 do not let the son of Babylon 

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:07.519
 come and defile us but we can 

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:10.969
 be safe and secure next to you 

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:13.689
