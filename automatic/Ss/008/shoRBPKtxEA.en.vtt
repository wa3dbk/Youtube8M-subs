00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.270

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.010
 of how are you today I 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.809
 are well and cost today we are 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.600
 find for a video a little out 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 topic quite special because today 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.629
 we will talk about several things like 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 you saw in the title I'm going 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.600
 propose a small several episodes where 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.940
 we will be able to have fun together really 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.699
 nice but before all that I present to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.000
 little gameplay one is sure about slam without 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.790
 domination had slammed four n 94 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 with the handle arago normal handle and 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.449
 viewfinder reflex so I use the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.729
 main over-equipped at this it seems to me 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.390
 that I use ghost determination and 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 robustness and dexterity 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.049
 you will see that it's a gameplay 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.700
 who is really nice really not bad 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 at all I will propose it to you 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 really finally I wanted you to me 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.170
 propose because that's his first 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 the subject I am going to address today 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.859
 that's clear you may have noticed 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.960
 in recent times that I rage a lot 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.880
 of times on black ops the in any case 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
 on twitter we can even see that I 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.950
 easily go ps3 I'm raging because 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.570
 the connections be a little crappy I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.179
 go on xbox and a little crappy alike 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.320
 to problems and all that so that's 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.359
 pretty crappy lately 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 especially that we will honestly say I 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.890
 do really good parts in this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.570
 moment finally a good start of part you 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 will see often in good start 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.110
 of party and all that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.310
 so that's a bit of a pity either because 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260
 that orange frankly I miss a lot 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.220
 of gameplay 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.920
 I miss a lot of gameplay these 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.910
 recent times georges irat and qualcomm 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.930
 easily I missed what honestly 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.210
 I missed a double nuclear double 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.780
 with there we had a haven with the 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.960
 China as I missed what I missed a 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.840
 a clear cap 40.1 already stuff 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.810
 who do not often see a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.890
 nuclear at cac 40 on after 9 in 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.930
 confirmed eliminations 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.370
 so here it is already three things 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.930
 which are quite rare enough to see and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.030
 here I missed that plus the problems of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.860
 disconnect and all that there are plenty of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.690
 things like that bowls of lags 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.120
 it's a bit crappy right now 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.800
 until why lately call 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 of the online berg a little it's true that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.420
 honestly I'm playing a little bit more 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.890
 line lately because we're going 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.530
 to say that I'm a little cooler and 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.880
 then honestly I did what it does 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.770
 a week that I have to play or more 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.940
 an hour a day and again 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.170
 it's half an hour I'm doing three 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.730
 left I see that I'm drunk I stop 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.080
 because I really do not care anymore 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.840
 debt and so that's so that was the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.380
 small the little analysis I do not know if 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.489
 you too 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.650
 lately you have 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.660
 some problems the league I do not have 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.010
 still playing too much on these 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.680
 lately I have not played on 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.090
 season 5 where the 6 I know more so I 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.269
 can not really say what happened 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.920
 passed in front is happening in any case 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.410
 at the level of the online connection I see 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.410
 that there are many problems 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.670
 that's good it's not too much at the level of 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.840
 people who play to be me because 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.970
 it's true that I play a lot of crazy people 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.370
 a lot of solo time on xbox too 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.890
 maybe say that too so I do not 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.690
 do not know if it also plays to join 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.100
 many two parts and all ages 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.049
 fhd then left I'm obliged 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.760
 to wait for it to end for 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.870
 can start another one because 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.630
 otherwise I as I always arrive in 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.370
 from 180 to 18 and that's where I get 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.269
 was with dogs and all that so in 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.130
 principle you quit 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.470
 but you join a note wherever you 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.450
 you redo on another map and 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.760
 so it's not worth it for you 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.400
 finish as much let go of the joystick and and 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.829
 wait for it to end and so that's it 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.880
 so it was a first time down the 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.739
 little jerk as I tell you 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.350
 said and then in the second time I you 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.910
 was talking about something that got me 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.310
 ba that went through my head because 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.500
 I said to myself that I'm still here 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.600
 not far from 4000 subscribers and all that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.040
 it's a small community already 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.870
 and I see you're pretty active 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.209
 already on twitter finally I see that 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.270
 I can still get a little bit of 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.760
 opinion comedians and all that when I 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.320
 ask you my opinion especially in my 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.100
 last video on the lag and all that 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.230
 video by the way who is very happy 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.490
 I did that for the delirium 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.190
 confess I had more ball and I 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.740
 missed my nuclear here I was at 22.23 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.220
 I do not know anymore and yeah, so here we go 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.900
 I have a little balls and so yes I 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.160
 please ch I have a small community I 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.260
 I told myself why not for the 4000 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.380
 even before you start 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.230
 little series that would be a little 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.610
 how to say own to my channel that you 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.410
 could you see every week 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.290
 where every two weeks based 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.600
 clips that I get because yes he 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.430
 will have to finally I count on you for 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.520
 to send me clips because I would like 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.350
 to make a top a top 5 or a top 10 in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.960
 function of the cubes I get a top 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.790
 10 and call of duty queues in 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.410
 principle on the French community 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.210
 and so here is a top 10 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.300
 leaves I think first after 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.130
 maybe you say swing as I'm doing 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.310
 the pixels maybe lepi gwyneth all 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.990
 so yes yes one more episodes that 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.540
 will not be reminded about every 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.270
 weeks and so that's why not so 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.700
 you have clips and all that do not hesitate 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.250
 not send them to me on my channel 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.200
 directly in my inbox 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.580
 you send me directly to you 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.680
 send me the name course for example 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.220
 you put 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.759
 video video video fail for example video 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.710
 leaves you see me you put the 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.830
 your nickname and the link of your video 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.190
 I will eventually look at what 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.759
 will be the best it would be to make a 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.870
 maximum quality finally minimum of 480 I 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:11.630
 do not think of pad no movie with with 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.190
 the camcorders and all that if you 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.500
 could take directly into the mode 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.330
 studio and you squarely you or burn 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.220
 on the call of string as you can 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.360
 do it that too 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.789
 that's if you do not have hd pvr or 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.320
 other and so here I would like to do this 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.000
 little thing tell me what you 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.330
 think and did not hesitate to eat plenty of 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.430
 clips 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.740
 even if you have 8 each 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.449
 send me the eight of which what so we 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.729
 will start I think by the top 10 fail 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.470
 or a top 5 file please me 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.500
 send to share with your friends and 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.150
 all this so that the top 10 is 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.639
 really nice and then that when we 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.380
 start a little to make live all that there 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.930
 I would really like to do this 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.409
 kind of things especially a little episode 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.919
 which is well done of Madeira on 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.240
 my channel here that when we 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.110
 recognize a little for that too 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.419
 would be funny 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.460
 and so here we go we start with 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.680
 myself you will see that this 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.419
 part actually is going to end more 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.590
 as quickly as possible I still 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:10.729
 started there let's say I was at 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.039
 49,48 I believe the end where 44 so 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:16.509
 honestly I was good at 60 the trip 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:21.229
 had restarted a series 50 60 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:24.289
 it will turn out that in fact here is a 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:26.090
 migration from others and a part that 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.280
 I will never see again because 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.750
 basle ended so here's listen 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.159

 not to share also the video and a max 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.650

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.310
 yeah that's it and for the video in 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.780
