they<00:03:36.750> work<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.290> they<00:03:37.440> use<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.010> they're

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
they work it and they use it and they're

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.460 
they work it and they use it and they're
better<00:03:38.820> for<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.390> service<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.020> those<00:03:40.140> citizens

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
better for and service to those citizens

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920 
better for and service to those citizens
is<00:03:40.980> quicker<00:03:41.400> faster<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> better<00:03:42.690> outcome

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
is quicker faster with a better outcome

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.870 
is quicker faster with a better outcome
so<00:03:43.710> this<00:03:43.890> demonstration<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.610> public

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
so this demonstration in the public

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.460 
so this demonstration in the public
safety<00:03:45.210> broadband<00:03:45.660> showed<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
safety broadband showed that the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.590 
safety broadband showed that the
equipment<00:03:46.740> is<00:03:46.980> available<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.820> technology<00:03:48.480> is

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
equipment is available the technology is

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.870 
equipment is available the technology is
available<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.800> real<00:03:50.070> we're<00:03:50.580> actively

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
available that it's real we're actively

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.490 
available that it's real we're actively
out<00:03:51.120> deploying<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.870> right<00:03:52.080> now<00:03:52.230> getting

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
out deploying this right now getting

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.080 
out deploying this right now getting
ready<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.920> put<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.190> into<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.670> pans<00:03:53.910> of

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
ready to put this into the pans of

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.370 
ready to put this into the pans of
Public<00:03:54.330> Safety<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.960> they<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.200> start

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
Public Safety so that they can start

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.260 
Public Safety so that they can start
putting<00:03:55.770> it<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.950> good<00:03:55.980> use<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.490> we<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.940> provide

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
putting it to good use if we can provide

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.910 
putting it to good use if we can provide
the<00:03:57.330> best<00:03:57.840> solution<00:03:58.590> for<00:03:58.800> fighting<00:03:59.520> crime<00:03:59.790> and

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
the best solution for fighting crime and

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.570 
the best solution for fighting crime and
increasing<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:01.980> quality<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.340> life<00:04:02.550> for
