was<00:05:08.750> too<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.230> logged<00:05:09.440> in<00:05:09.590> yesterday<00:05:10.070> there<00:05:10.400> was

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
was too I logged in yesterday there was

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.580 
was too I logged in yesterday there was
a<00:05:10.580> huge<00:05:10.910> patch<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.530> had<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.890> do<00:05:13.040> and<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.930> went

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
a huge patch that I had to do and I went

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.430 
a huge patch that I had to do and I went
and<00:05:15.910> finished<00:05:16.910> up<00:05:17.270> some<00:05:17.480> living<00:05:17.750> stories<00:05:18.260> but

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
and finished up some living stories but

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.930 
and finished up some living stories but
I've<00:05:18.530> still<00:05:18.740> got<00:05:18.919> a<00:05:18.950> couple<00:05:19.130> door<00:05:19.430> locked<00:05:19.669> I

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
I've still got a couple door locked I

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.640 
I've still got a couple door locked I
think<00:05:20.150> it's<00:05:20.270> only<00:05:20.390> two<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:20.930> can't<00:05:21.200> do<00:05:21.380> I

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
think it's only two that I can't do I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.080 
think it's only two that I can't do I
think<00:05:22.190> it's<00:05:22.340> entanglement<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:25.490> echoes

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
think it's entanglement and this echoes

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.640 
think it's entanglement and this echoes
of<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.300> past<00:05:26.390> but<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.870> did<00:05:27.080> echoes<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.560> past

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
of the past but I did echoes of the past

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.500 
of the past but I did echoes of the past
because<00:05:28.100> someone<00:05:28.490> else<00:05:28.669> I<00:05:28.760> locked<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.150> for<00:05:29.330> me

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
because someone else I locked it for me

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.250 
because someone else I locked it for me
