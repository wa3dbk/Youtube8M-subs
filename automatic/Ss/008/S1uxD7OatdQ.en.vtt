terms<00:02:37.840> not<00:02:38.020> so<00:02:38.170> pops<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.530> really<00:02:38.770> does<00:02:38.980> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
terms not so pops that really does and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.460 
terms not so pops that really does and
then<00:02:40.000> it's<00:02:40.180> very<00:02:40.240> good<00:02:40.540> against<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.020> Esper

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
