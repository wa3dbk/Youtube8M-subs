this<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.370> quick<00:01:22.120> review<00:01:22.690> on<00:01:22.960> how<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.619> made

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
this is a quick review on how we made

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.300 
this is a quick review on how we made
the<00:01:24.219> connectors<00:01:24.789> for<00:01:25.539> greater<00:01:25.840> detail<00:01:26.469> take<00:01:27.280> a

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
the connectors for greater detail take a

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.170 
the connectors for greater detail take a
look<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.850> our<00:01:28.000> other<00:01:28.619> video

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.139 

so<00:01:35.180> here<00:01:35.479> we<00:01:35.750> have<00:01:35.960> our<00:01:36.170> 12<00:01:36.759> connectors<00:01:40.149> here

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
so here we have our 12 connectors here

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.710 
so here we have our 12 connectors here
we<00:01:41.450> have<00:01:41.689> a<00:01:41.899> piece<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.799> paper<00:01:43.159> all<00:01:43.820> pre-folded

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
we have a piece of paper all pre-folded

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.620 
we have a piece of paper all pre-folded
we<00:01:45.470> are<00:01:45.560> going<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:45.920> collapse<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.640> into<00:01:46.820> almost

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
we are going to collapse it into almost

00:01:47.630 --> 00:02:04.810 
we are going to collapse it into almost
this<00:01:48.409> shape<00:02:01.689> if<00:02:02.689> we<00:02:02.929> want<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.229> insert<00:02:03.860> anything

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
this shape if we want to insert anything

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.090 
this shape if we want to insert anything
in<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.270> middle<00:02:05.630> here<00:02:05.959> this<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.560> moment<00:02:06.799> to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
in the middle here this is the moment to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.670 
in the middle here this is the moment to
do<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.880> we<00:02:08.299> will<00:02:08.920> place<00:02:09.920> something<00:02:10.819> there

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
do it so we will place something there

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.020 
do it so we will place something there
for<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.799> moment<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:13.220> are<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.670> leave<00:02:13.970> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
for the moment we are going to leave it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:23.890 
for the moment we are going to leave it
as<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:16.130> fold<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.549> out<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.959> then<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:22.900> like

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
as is we fold it out and then in like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.509 
as is we fold it out and then in like
that<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.590> we'll<00:02:25.069> leave<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.360> unfolded<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
that and we'll leave it unfolded and the

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.110 
that and we'll leave it unfolded and the
same<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> other<00:02:29.330> three<00:02:30.010> flaps<00:02:33.640> once<00:02:34.640> we

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
same for the other three flaps once we

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.340 
same for the other three flaps once we
have<00:02:35.420> six<00:02:36.080> modules<00:02:36.500> at<00:02:37.099> this<00:02:37.459> stage<00:02:38.320> we<00:02:39.320> are

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
have six modules at this stage we are

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.330 
have six modules at this stage we are
going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.709> place<00:02:40.070> them<00:02:40.459> for<00:02:41.420> mean<00:02:41.600> across

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
going to place them for mean across

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.110 
going to place them for mean across
making<00:02:43.340> sure<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.769> not<00:02:45.769> two<00:02:46.160> matches<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
making sure that not two matches of the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.140 
making sure that not two matches of the
same<00:02:47.390> color<00:02:47.810> are<00:02:48.819> adjacent<00:02:51.400> now<00:02:52.400> we<00:02:52.850> are<00:02:52.940> going

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
same color are adjacent now we are going

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.020 
same color are adjacent now we are going
to<00:02:53.239> be<00:02:53.420> using<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.470> collectors<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.760> join

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
to be using the collectors to join

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.650 
to be using the collectors to join
together<00:02:56.299> each<00:02:56.900> piece<00:02:57.819> we<00:02:58.819> have<00:02:59.030> one<00:02:59.269> side<00:02:59.510> of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
together each piece we have one side of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.509 
together each piece we have one side of
the<00:02:59.780> connector<00:03:00.140> which<00:03:00.530> has<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.890> flaps<00:03:01.190> we

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
the connector which has the flaps we

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.460 
the connector which has the flaps we
make<00:03:01.700> sure<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.359> side<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:03.370> underneath

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
make sure that that side is underneath

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.550 
make sure that that side is underneath
now<00:03:06.470> we<00:03:06.530> take<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.250> point<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.910> insert<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:09.049> in

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
now we take one point and insert it in

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.050 
now we take one point and insert it in
this<00:03:11.560> pocket<00:03:13.030> once<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.299> inside<00:03:15.250> we<00:03:16.250> proceed

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
this pocket once it's inside we proceed

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.230 
this pocket once it's inside we proceed
to<00:03:17.269> refold<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.150> inside

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.980 

we<00:03:25.140> are<00:03:25.230> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.530> insert<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.980> other<00:03:26.990> half

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
we are going to insert the other half

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.220 
we are going to insert the other half
into<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.770> next<00:03:29.160> one

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
into the next one

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:40.370 
into the next one
and<00:03:31.230> repeat<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.490> process<00:03:38.960> we<00:03:39.960> repeat<00:03:40.260> the

process here and then we add here here
and<00:03:44.280> here<00:03:44.780> making<00:03:45.780> sure<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:46.140> we<00:03:46.320> form<00:03:46.710> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
and here making sure that we form the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.960 
and here making sure that we form the
cross<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:50.960> here<00:03:51.960> we<00:03:52.260> have<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.280> cross<00:03:53.610> all

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
cross and here we have the cross all

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.670 
cross and here we have the cross all
made<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:56.250> far<00:03:56.520> we<00:03:56.880> have<00:03:57.090> inserted<00:03:57.750> five<00:03:58.140> tabs

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
made so far we have inserted five tabs

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.170 
made so far we have inserted five tabs
we<00:03:59.550> have<00:03:59.760> seven<00:04:00.360> more<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.870> go

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
we have seven more to go

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.210 
we have seven more to go
notice<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.360> location<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.170> these<00:04:04.500> tabs

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.280 

these<00:04:08.220> parts<00:04:08.670> will<00:04:08.819> be<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.060> outside<00:04:09.569> of<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
these parts will be the outside of the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.250 
these parts will be the outside of the
cube<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:11.010> can't<00:04:11.280> turn<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.849> over<00:04:12.049> this<00:04:13.049> will

connecting every time we make a
connection<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.260> fold<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.660> towards<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> back

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
connection we fold it towards the back

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:51.700 
connection we fold it towards the back
and<00:04:42.710> now<00:04:43.710> we<00:04:43.770> proceed<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.699> make<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.660> last<00:04:45.960> one

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.550 

notice<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.740> three<00:04:53.100> tabs<00:04:53.430> go<00:04:54.139> at<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.320> same

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
notice that three tabs go at the same

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.650 
notice that three tabs go at the same
time<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:59.490> then<00:04:59.729> we<00:04:59.880> lock<00:05:00.120> them<00:05:00.389> in<00:05:00.630> place

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
time and then we lock them in place

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:18.110 
time and then we lock them in place
using<00:05:01.289> existing<00:05:02.160> funds<00:05:16.099> now<00:05:17.099> we<00:05:17.669> proceed<00:05:17.910> to

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
using existing funds now we proceed to

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.629 
using existing funds now we proceed to
shape<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.139> hearts<00:05:19.590> on<00:05:19.830> each<00:05:20.190> one<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.520> the

shape the hearts on each one of the

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:30.029 
shape the hearts on each one of the
corners

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:38.650 

carefully<00:05:31.039> we<00:05:31.310> use<00:05:31.750> existing<00:05:32.750> phones<00:05:37.660> and

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
carefully we use existing phones and

00:05:38.660 --> 00:06:02.439 
carefully we use existing phones and
repeat<00:05:39.199> the<00:05:39.710> process<00:06:00.130> our<00:06:01.130> cube<00:06:01.699> is<00:06:02.000> almost

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
repeat the process our cube is almost

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.010 
repeat the process our cube is almost
finished<00:06:03.080> we<00:06:03.560> just<00:06:03.860> have<00:06:04.130> two<00:06:04.729> more<00:06:04.940> to<00:06:05.150> go<00:06:05.330> at

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
finished we just have two more to go at

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.580 
finished we just have two more to go at
this<00:06:06.319> point<00:06:06.710> if<00:06:07.099> we<00:06:07.159> want<00:06:07.490> to<00:06:07.849> hang<00:06:08.449> it<00:06:08.690> we<00:06:09.349> can

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
this point if we want to hang it we can

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.120 
this point if we want to hang it we can
