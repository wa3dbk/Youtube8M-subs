this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.000> rift<00:00:06.240> master<00:00:06.629> interchangeable

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
this is the rift master interchangeable

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.549 
this is the rift master interchangeable
pickguard<00:00:07.849> it<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.030> essentially<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.780> two-piece

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
pickguard it is essentially a two-piece

permanently<00:00:14.759> mounted<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> guitar<00:00:15.719> body

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
permanently mounted to the guitar body

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.720 
permanently mounted to the guitar body
and<00:00:16.289> held<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.490> three<00:00:17.970> screws<00:00:19.160> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.550> what

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and held in by three screws this is what

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420 
and held in by three screws this is what
I<00:00:20.760> call<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.240> guitar<00:00:21.570> skin<00:00:21.949> it's<00:00:22.949> roughly<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I call a guitar skin it's roughly the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.700 
I call a guitar skin it's roughly the
thickness<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.970> credit<00:00:24.269> card<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:25.560> can

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
thickness of a credit card and we can

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
thickness of a credit card and we can
print<00:00:25.980> directly<00:00:26.099> onto<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.750> use

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
print directly onto it or we can use

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.870 
print directly onto it or we can use
also<00:00:28.170> standard<00:00:28.710> materials<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.640> case

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
also standard materials in this case

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.780 
also standard materials in this case
we've<00:00:30.210> printed<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:34.100> now<00:00:35.100> I'll<00:00:35.250> show<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.489> how

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
we've printed it now I'll show you how

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.049 
we've printed it now I'll show you how
the<00:00:35.850> system<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.780> installed<00:00:37.969> essentially<00:00:38.969> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the system is installed essentially you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
the system is installed essentially you
have<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.390> components<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> find<00:00:40.260> my<00:00:40.379> switch

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
have your components you find my switch

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.139 
have your components you find my switch
and<00:00:41.010> you've<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> series<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> perimeter

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and you've got a series of perimeter

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.410 
and you've got a series of perimeter
screws<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:44.190> component<00:00:44.789> knobs<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
screws the component knobs for the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.459 
screws the component knobs for the
volume<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> tone<00:00:46.370> are<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.670> compression

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
volume and the tone are just compression

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.279 
volume and the tone are just compression
things<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> 5-way<00:00:52.260> switch

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
things and then so as a 5-way switch

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.430 
things and then so as a 5-way switch
easily<00:00:53.160> removed<00:00:53.809> then<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
easily removed then we just have the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.670 
easily removed then we just have the
perimeters<00:00:55.890> crews<00:00:56.960> now<00:00:57.960> I've<00:00:58.140> loosened<00:00:58.350> these

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
perimeters crews now I've loosened these

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.240 
perimeters crews now I've loosened these
just<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> purposes<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.820> demonstration

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
just for the purposes of demonstration

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
just for the purposes of demonstration
but<00:01:02.250> essentially<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.969> takes<00:01:03.260> Phillips

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
but essentially it just takes Phillips

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
but essentially it just takes Phillips
head<00:01:04.409> screwdriver<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> remove<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.990> nothing

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
head screwdriver to remove them nothing

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
head screwdriver to remove them nothing
different<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> once<00:01:11.070> these

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
different about that so once these

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.359 
different about that so once these
screws<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:13.049> knobs<00:01:13.290> are<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.590> then

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
screws are out the knobs are off then

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
screws are out the knobs are off then
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> remove<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.570> guitar<00:01:15.840> skin<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you can remove the guitar skin the way I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.810 
you can remove the guitar skin the way I
take<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> guitar<00:01:19.590> skin<00:01:19.950> off<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.400> slide<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
take the guitar skin off as I slide it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
take the guitar skin off as I slide it
up<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> neck<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> side<00:01:22.830> either

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
up the neck and then out the side either

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
up the neck and then out the side either
side<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.420> again<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> guitar<00:01:28.290> skin

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
side and again this is the guitar skin

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.580 
side and again this is the guitar skin
notice<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.170> base<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.470> still

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
notice that the the base is still

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.270 
notice that the the base is still
attached<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> guitar<00:01:33.320> by<00:01:34.320> these<00:01:34.530> three

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
attached to the guitar by these three

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.969 
attached to the guitar by these three
screws<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:36.990> stay<00:01:37.170> permanently<00:01:37.590> fixed

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
screws so it will stay permanently fixed

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
screws so it will stay permanently fixed
so<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.479> matter<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:39.900> type

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so now it's just a matter of what type

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
so now it's just a matter of what type
of<00:01:40.140> guitar<00:01:40.259> skin<00:01:40.650> need<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> print

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
of guitar skin need like this is a print

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.420 
of guitar skin need like this is a print
we<00:01:42.780> did

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
we did

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
we did
I<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:45.860> slice<00:01:46.860> directly<00:01:47.520> over<00:01:47.670> top<00:01:48.229> if<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I like slice directly over top if this

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
I like slice directly over top if this
is<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> want<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.250> put<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.640> screws

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
is the one you want you put your screws

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.020 
is the one you want you put your screws
back<00:01:51.090> down<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.560> put<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:52.979> toner<00:01:53.729> going

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
back down and you put your toner going

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.670 
back down and you put your toner going
nuts<00:01:54.270> back<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.720 

this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.800> another<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.280> sort<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
this is another one sort of a

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.710 
this is another one sort of a
holographic<00:02:00.210> image<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:03.000> again<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.450> slides

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
holographic image this again it slides

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.790 
holographic image this again it slides
directly<00:02:03.930> under<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.410> neck<00:02:08.570> right<00:02:09.570> down<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
directly under the neck right down on to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.280 
directly under the neck right down on to
the<00:02:10.890> base<00:02:13.640> now<00:02:14.640> guitar<00:02:15.510> players<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.960> have<00:02:16.140> an

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the base now guitar players can have an

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.890 
the base now guitar players can have an
unlimited<00:02:16.620> number<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.280> choices<00:02:18.150> when

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
unlimited number of choices when

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.840 
unlimited number of choices when
selecting<00:02:18.960> guitar<00:02:19.650> skins<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:23.670> one

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
selecting guitar skins this this one

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.190 
selecting guitar skins this this one
seems<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.240> work<00:02:24.480> pretty<00:02:24.510> well<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:25.050> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
seems to work pretty well with this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.030 
seems to work pretty well with this
color<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:26.970> black<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.740> we<00:02:28.830> put

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
color just like it in black and we put

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.820 
color just like it in black and we put
our<00:02:29.160> thumb<00:02:29.790> knobs<00:02:30.000> back<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:33.080> very<00:02:34.080> quick<00:02:34.380> and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
our thumb knobs back on very quick and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.220 
our thumb knobs back on very quick and
very<00:02:34.860> easy<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:36.260> inexpensive<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.810> offers<00:02:40.200> a
