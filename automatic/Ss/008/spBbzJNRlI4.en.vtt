first bar so what I did there I start

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.119 
first bar so what I did there I start
off<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:40.950> both<00:00:41.309> fingers<00:00:41.670> down<00:00:41.850> v<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.600> G<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.180 
off with both fingers down v on G and
the<00:00:44.129> fourth<00:00:44.370> fret<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.640> B<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.260> played<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the fourth fret on B I played on and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
the fourth fret on B I played on and
then<00:00:47.610> took<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.030> second<00:00:48.480> finger<00:00:48.629> off<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.440> expose

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
then took my second finger off to expose

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.020 
then took my second finger off to expose
the<00:00:49.770> open<00:00:50.219> G<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.820> so<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the open G so we got one and so on the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
the open G so we got one and so on the
end<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.780> open<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
end is when it's open so we're going to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.529 
end is when it's open so we're going to
do<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.399> beats<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:56.940> two<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.449> it's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
do that for beats one and two so it's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.979 
do that for beats one and two so it's
going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.660> then<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.809> move

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to go one and two and then we move

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.039 
going to go one and two and then we move
down<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.649> fret<00:01:01.829> lower<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> half<00:01:02.760> step

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
down one fret lower which is a half step

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
down one fret lower which is a half step
three<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.290> four<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.390> repeat

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
