00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:08.469 
do like a 30 second snippet type of

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.079 
do like a 30 second snippet type of
video<00:00:09.130> right<00:00:09.460> now<00:00:09.490> and<00:00:10.030> basically<00:00:10.719> I<00:00:11.379> have<00:00:12.089> I

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
just want to tell you what I was using

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.820 
just want to tell you what I was using
on<00:00:15.040> your<00:00:15.070> hair<00:00:15.280> to<00:00:15.429> make<00:00:15.669> the<00:00:16.059> flame<00:00:16.570> is<00:00:17.410> what<00:00:17.800> i

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
on your hair to make the flame is what i

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.080 
on your hair to make the flame is what i
call<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.369> this<00:00:19.240> is<00:00:19.539> a<00:00:19.990> matrix<00:00:20.410> color<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:24.090> it's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
call it this is a matrix color and it's

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.579 
call it this is a matrix color and it's
by<00:00:25.269> matrix<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.449> a<00:00:28.689> CR<00:00:29.289> which

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
by matrix and this is a CR which

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:35.010 
by matrix and this is a CR which
basically<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.339> copper<00:00:30.880> red<00:00:31.500> okay<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.840> in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
basically a copper red okay and just in

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.680 
basically a copper red okay and just in
case<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:36.090> mixed<00:00:37.090> it<00:00:37.180> with<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:39.219> same<00:00:39.690> company

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
case I mixed it with the same company

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.410 
case I mixed it with the same company
which<00:00:40.930> is<00:00:40.960> matrix<00:00:41.530> with<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.039> six<00:00:42.340> RC<00:00:43.090> which<00:00:43.270> is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
which is matrix with the six RC which is

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.180 
which is matrix with the six RC which is
just<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.719> rare<00:00:43.930> copper<00:00:44.200> so<00:00:44.559> I<00:00:44.590> just<00:00:44.770> put<00:00:44.829> an

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
just a rare copper so I just put an

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.990 
just a rare copper so I just put an
ounce<00:00:45.879> of<00:00:46.149> both<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.930> them<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:48.250> some<00:00:48.550> twenty

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
ounce of both of them with some twenty

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.349 
ounce of both of them with some twenty
developer<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.050> that's<00:00:50.890> this<00:00:51.309> color<00:00:51.640> right<00:00:51.760> at

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
developer and that's this color right at

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.810 
developer and that's this color right at
the<00:00:52.539> top<00:00:52.719> it's<00:00:53.649> still<00:00:53.890> developing<00:00:54.489> so<00:00:54.670> it's

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
the top it's still developing so it's

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.520 
the top it's still developing so it's
not<00:00:54.969> actually<00:00:55.420> as<00:00:55.570> dark<00:00:55.899> as<00:00:56.020> it's<00:00:56.230> going<00:00:56.410> to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
not actually as dark as it's going to

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
not actually as dark as it's going to
get<00:00:56.710> I<00:00:57.989> also<00:00:58.989> have<00:00:59.620> my<00:00:59.649> cheek<00:01:00.340> color<00:01:00.609> additive

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
get I also have my cheek color additive

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.200 
get I also have my cheek color additive
which<00:01:02.410> is<00:01:02.829> orange<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.380> and<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:07.000> by

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
which is orange there it is and it's by

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.940 
which is orange there it is and it's by
chi<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.700> color<00:01:09.970> is<00:01:10.090> right<00:01:10.720> here<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.530> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
chi and that color is right here in the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.620 
chi and that color is right here in the
middle<00:01:11.980> I<00:01:12.340> know<00:01:12.400> it<00:01:12.610> looks<00:01:12.700> red<00:01:13.000> right<00:01:13.180> now<00:01:13.360> but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
it's going to be orange one rear ends it

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.650 
it's going to be orange one rear ends it
it<00:01:16.150> wasn't<00:01:16.930> as<00:01:17.700> pleased<00:01:18.700> with<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.180> blonde<00:01:19.450> is

it wasn't as pleased with the blonde is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.480 
it wasn't as pleased with the blonde is
I<00:01:19.810> would<00:01:19.960> like<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.380> was<00:01:20.500> still<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.800> beautiful

blonde but I wanted it to be whiter so I

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
went on ahead and I put kaleido color

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.670 
went on ahead and I put kaleido color
blue<00:01:27.510> which<00:01:28.510> I<00:01:28.690> used<00:01:28.960> all<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.380> through<00:01:29.590> the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
for maybe 30 minutes just to give the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.240 
for maybe 30 minutes just to give the
hair<00:02:25.690> back<00:02:25.900> some<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> vitality<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.980> it

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
hair back some of the vitality that it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.340 
hair back some of the vitality that it
lost<00:02:27.519> through<00:02:27.880> all<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.300> dying<00:02:28.750> and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
lost through all this dying and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.100 
lost through all this dying and
bleaching<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:31.300> then<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.570> also<00:02:31.600> suggest

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
bleaching so and then I also suggest

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.310 
bleaching so and then I also suggest
letting<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.769> air<00:02:32.950> dry<00:02:33.220> try<00:02:34.060> not<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.540> blow<00:02:35.170> it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
letting it air dry try not to blow it

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.590 
letting it air dry try not to blow it
dry<00:02:35.880> afterwards<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.269> gives<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.540> a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
dry afterwards because it gives it a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.780 
dry afterwards because it gives it a
different<00:02:37.630> texture<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.280> put<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
different texture you can put it on a

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.390 
different texture you can put it on a
hair<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.019> what<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.200> usually<00:02:41.410> do<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.709> put<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.280> on

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
hair and what I usually do is put it on

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.090 
hair and what I usually do is put it on
the<00:02:42.489> hanger<00:02:42.640> put<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> towel<00:02:43.660> beneath<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.410> raises

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
the hanger put a towel beneath it raises

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.250 
the hanger put a towel beneath it raises
up<00:02:45.220> high<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:46.000> let<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.269> drip<00:02:46.570> dry<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
up high and just let it drip dry and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.590 
up high and just let it drip dry and
then<00:02:48.040> by<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.250> time<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.790> use<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.450> going
