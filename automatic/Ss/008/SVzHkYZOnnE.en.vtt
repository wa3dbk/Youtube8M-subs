00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
all right so I'm going to actually zoom

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.630 
all right so I'm going to actually zoom
in<00:00:02.669> nice<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.360> tight<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:03.959> woodblock<00:00:04.640> we

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
in nice and tight on this woodblock we

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.760 
in nice and tight on this woodblock we
want<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.850> be<00:00:05.940> able<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.180> see<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.569> grain<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.680> if

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
want to be able to see this grain so if

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.110 
want to be able to see this grain so if
it<00:00:07.859> came<00:00:08.010> down<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.400> said<00:00:08.580> okay<00:00:08.790> I'm<00:00:08.910> going<00:00:09.059> to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
it came down and said okay I'm going to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.669 
it came down and said okay I'm going to
turn<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.480> bump<00:00:09.809> map<00:00:09.990> that's<00:00:10.230> something<00:00:10.559> I

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
turn on my bump map that's something I

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.220 
turn on my bump map that's something I
want<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.160> use<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.840> way<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> think

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
want to use and and the way to think

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.629 
want to use and and the way to think
about<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.219> something<00:00:14.429> that

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
about it is this is something that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.060 
about it is this is something that
pushes<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.420> pulls<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.139> image<00:00:16.529> back<00:00:16.830> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
pushes and pulls that image back and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 
pushes and pulls that image back and
forth<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> surface<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.480> box<00:00:18.750> I

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
forth from the surface of this box I

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.960 
forth from the surface of this box I
mean<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.650> rhino<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.340> sees<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
mean really rhino just sees this as a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.509 
mean really rhino just sees this as a
cube<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:22.199> v-ray<00:00:22.650> that's<00:00:22.920> applying<00:00:23.340> this

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
cube it's v-ray that's applying this

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.250 
cube it's v-ray that's applying this
material<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.720> I'm<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.930> click<00:00:25.080> M

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
material to it so I'm going to click M

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.140 
material to it so I'm going to click M
for<00:00:25.680> map<00:00:25.859> I'm<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> say<00:00:26.910> I'm<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
for map I'm going to say I'm going to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.599 
for map I'm going to say I'm going to
use<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> bitmap<00:00:27.619> I've<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> select<00:00:29.400> my

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
use a bitmap I've got to select my

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.269 
use a bitmap I've got to select my
bitmap<00:00:30.000> file<00:00:30.470> for<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.710> went<00:00:32.009> ahead<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
bitmap file for me I just went ahead and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.430 
bitmap file for me I just went ahead and
put<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> desktop<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
put it on the desktop and here it is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.370 
put it on the desktop and here it is
it's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.820> wood<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.989> named<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's a it's just a wood and I named it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.220 
it's a it's just a wood and I named it
bump<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> did<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.120> take<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.390> exact<00:00:39.899> file

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
bump what I did was take the exact file

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.740 
bump what I did was take the exact file
that<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.710> used<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.090> diffuse<00:00:42.540> color

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
that was used as the the diffuse color

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.110 
that was used as the the diffuse color
took<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.649> food<00:00:43.829> through<00:00:44.100> Photoshop<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> made

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
took it food through Photoshop and made

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.520 
took it food through Photoshop and made
it<00:00:45.270> black<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> white<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> played

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it black and white and then I played

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
it black and white and then I played
with<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> contrast<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.420> really

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
with a contrast you see it's it's really

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.889 
with a contrast you see it's it's really
sharp<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.829> white<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.340> black<00:00:50.899> so

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
sharp this is it's white with black so

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.090 
sharp this is it's white with black so
now<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.039> going

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
now what that's going to do it's going

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
now what that's going to do it's going
to<00:00:53.250> push<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.760> pull<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> material<00:00:54.239> slightly

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to push and pull that material slightly

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
to push and pull that material slightly
and<00:00:55.980> again<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.550> white<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and again like white would be the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
and again like white would be the
closest<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.079> black<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.649> furthest

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
closest then black would be the furthest

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
closest then black would be the furthest
and<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.820> able<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.930> change<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and we're able to to change kind of the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.959 
and we're able to to change kind of the
multiplier<00:01:02.010> again<00:01:02.340> let's<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
multiplier again let's see what this

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
multiplier again let's see what this
would<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:03.989> make<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> white<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
would it would really make it white if I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
would it would really make it white if I
said<00:01:05.280> 2.25<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.360> should<00:01:06.510> make<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.960> dark

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
said 2.25 it should make it really dark

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
said 2.25 it should make it really dark
so<00:01:07.890> we'll<00:01:08.010> leave<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.340> 1<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:10.549> our<00:01:11.549> our

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so we'll leave it at 1 and our our

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
so we'll leave it at 1 and our our
repeat<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> exactly<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
repeat is exactly we want it to be the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
repeat is exactly we want it to be the
same<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.939> diffuse<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.900> really

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
same as the diffuse that's really

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
same as the diffuse that's really
important<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> matches<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
important so it matches up if you if you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
important so it matches up if you if you
have<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> bump<00:01:18.869> map<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.320> doesn't<00:01:19.530> match<00:01:19.860> your

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
have a bump map that doesn't match your

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
have a bump map that doesn't match your
diffuse<00:01:20.580> map<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> look<00:01:22.020> right

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
diffuse map it's not going to look right

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.590 
diffuse map it's not going to look right
your<00:01:22.650> greens<00:01:23.009> wouldn't<00:01:23.430> align<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> remember

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
your greens wouldn't align so I remember

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
your greens wouldn't align so I remember
that<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:24.960> 4<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.890> rotation<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.490> zero

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that it was 4 for my rotation was zero

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
that it was 4 for my rotation was zero
so<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.299> match<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:27.990> diffuse<00:01:28.350> as

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so this will match the same diffuse as

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.160 
so this will match the same diffuse as
before<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.759> if<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.909> apply<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.930> look

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
before so if I apply that and we look

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.660 
before so if I apply that and we look
here<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.829> might<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.130> able<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> little

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here we might be able to see a little

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.620 
here we might be able to see a little
bit<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> difference

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bit of a difference

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
bit of a difference
it's<00:01:34.259> obviously<00:01:34.590> taking<00:01:35.040> longer<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.640> render

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it's obviously taking longer to render

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240 
it's obviously taking longer to render
and<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.380> deep

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and you can see these are really deep

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.270 
and you can see these are really deep
this<00:01:38.729> gritty<00:01:39.299> grain<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.650> clearly<00:01:40.979> we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this gritty grain here so clearly we

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
this gritty grain here so clearly we
have<00:01:41.460> too<00:01:41.759> much<00:01:42.439> kind<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.610> effect<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:45.750> place

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
have too much kind of effect in place

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.069 
have too much kind of effect in place
here<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.619> let's<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:49.049> we

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
here so let's see if we there's a way we

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.720 
here so let's see if we there's a way we
can<00:01:49.380> control<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
can control that

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.390 
can control that
come<00:01:52.570> back<00:01:52.720> in<00:01:52.930> maps<00:01:53.440> there's<00:01:54.190> migraine

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
come back in maps there's migraine

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.590 
come back in maps there's migraine
channel<00:01:57.400> environment<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:01.090> over<00:02:01.420> right

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
channel environment it's over right

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.290 
channel environment it's over right
maybe<00:02:01.900> if<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.140> lower<00:02:02.410> this<00:02:02.680> down<00:02:03.210> there's<00:02:04.210> a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
maybe if we lower this down there's a

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.480 
maybe if we lower this down there's a
little<00:02:04.420> darker<00:02:05.020> those<00:02:05.500> gamma<00:02:05.860> override<00:02:06.340> we

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
little darker those gamma override we

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.120 
little darker those gamma override we
don't<00:02:06.670> we<00:02:06.880> don't<00:02:07.000> need<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.270> mess<00:02:07.450> with<00:02:07.480> that

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
don't we don't need to mess with that

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.510 
don't we don't need to mess with that
it's<00:02:09.130> our<00:02:09.340> blur<00:02:09.640> tile<00:02:10.350> mini<00:02:11.350> map<00:02:11.560> sure<00:02:11.920> so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it's our blur tile mini map sure so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.750 
it's our blur tile mini map sure so
let's<00:02:12.700> lower<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.090> multiplier<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.930> how<00:02:14.260> much

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
let's lower the multiplier on how much

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.940 
let's lower the multiplier on how much
so<00:02:15.760> we're<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.120> fairly<00:02:16.570> dark<00:02:16.870> there<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.830> if

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so we're all fairly dark there see if

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
so we're all fairly dark there see if
we're<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:19.000> always<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.270> good<00:02:19.390> idea<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.660> preview

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
we're it's always a good idea to preview

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.240 
we're it's always a good idea to preview
it<00:02:20.290> instead<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.650> doing<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.980> rendering

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it instead of just doing the rendering

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.980 
it instead of just doing the rendering
then<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.790> end<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.420> know<00:02:22.450> wasting<00:02:22.900> all

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
then you end up you know wasting all

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.140 
then you end up you know wasting all
this<00:02:23.110> time<00:02:23.280> all<00:02:24.280> right<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.520> it's<00:02:24.700> maybe<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
this time all right so it's maybe a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.390 
this time all right so it's maybe a
little<00:02:25.210> better<00:02:25.690> let's<00:02:26.350> give<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.620> another<00:02:26.740> shot

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
little better let's give it another shot

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:36.380 
little better let's give it another shot
at<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.710> point<00:02:29.710> one<00:02:31.440> apply<00:02:32.440> here<00:02:33.040> update<00:02:33.520> there

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.670 

all<00:02:37.390> right<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:37.870> starting<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.470> calm

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
all right it's it's starting to calm

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800 
all right it's it's starting to calm
down<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:39.220> bit<00:02:39.550> it's<00:02:39.760> still<00:02:40.150> pretty

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
down a little bit it's still pretty

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.540 
down a little bit it's still pretty
grainy<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.800> let's<00:02:41.950> go<00:02:42.070> ahead<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.340> give<00:02:42.430> this

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
grainy but let's go ahead and give this

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.449 
grainy but let's go ahead and give this
a<00:02:42.610> shot<00:02:42.910> see<00:02:43.300> what<00:02:43.330> we're<00:02:43.600> coming<00:02:43.840> up<00:02:43.990> with

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.580 

so<00:02:50.060> it's<00:02:50.180> rendering<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.689> can<00:02:50.719> see<00:02:50.959> just<00:02:51.439> by

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
so it's rendering you can see just by

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.949 
so it's rendering you can see just by
changing<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:52.010> one<00:02:52.280> effect<00:02:52.670> we've<00:02:53.269> increased

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
changing that one effect we've increased

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.479 
changing that one effect we've increased
our<00:02:54.140> rendering<00:02:54.469> time<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:55.069> much<00:02:55.310> more

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
our rendering time it's much more

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.759 
our rendering time it's much more
difficult<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.840> computer<00:02:57.230> programs<00:02:57.560> got<00:02:57.680> to

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
difficult the computer programs got to

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.140 
difficult the computer programs got to
figure<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.189> can<00:02:58.310> see<00:02:58.549> how<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.849> light

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
figure out you can see how the light

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.959 
figure out you can see how the light
starts<00:02:59.659> the<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.409> be<00:03:00.560> bouncing<00:03:01.250> off<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.760> grain

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
starts the to be bouncing off the grain

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.880 
starts the to be bouncing off the grain
of<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.209> wood<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.599> not<00:03:02.750> nearly<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.379> smooth<00:03:03.709> as

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
of the wood it's not nearly as smooth as

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.069 
of the wood it's not nearly as smooth as
it<00:03:04.010> was<00:03:04.159> before<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:05.150> can<00:03:05.299> really<00:03:05.659> see<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.989> it

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
it was before you can really see that it

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.559 
it was before you can really see that it
here<00:03:06.230> at<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.439> top<00:03:06.650> if<00:03:07.519> we<00:03:07.609> came<00:03:07.849> back<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.450> and

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
here at the top if we came back here and

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.839 
here at the top if we came back here and
change<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:09.079> again<00:03:09.439> and<00:03:10.129> maybe<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.519> will<00:03:10.639> want

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
change this again and maybe we will want

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.240 
change this again and maybe we will want
point<00:03:11.299> oh<00:03:11.420> five<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.439> even<00:03:12.650> half<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.159> that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
point oh five so it's even half of that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.319 
point oh five so it's even half of that
grain<00:03:14.379> so<00:03:15.379> zoom<00:03:15.650> really<00:03:16.340> close<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:17.000> here<00:03:17.209> and

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
grain so zoom really close in here and

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.420 
grain so zoom really close in here and
see<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:17.540> we<00:03:17.659> can<00:03:17.810> really<00:03:18.319> see<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.590> depth<00:03:21.430> yeah

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
see if we can really see that depth yeah

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.099 
see if we can really see that depth yeah
there<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.180> know<00:03:23.269> you're<00:03:23.450> really<00:03:23.689> starting<00:03:24.079> to

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
there you know you're really starting to

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.530 
there you know you're really starting to
see<00:03:24.409> kind<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.829> nitty-gritty<00:03:25.189> of<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
see kind of the nitty-gritty of that and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.179 
see kind of the nitty-gritty of that and
that's<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:27.230> know<00:03:27.319> one<00:03:27.739> thing<00:03:28.010> to

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
that's just you know one thing to

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's just you know one thing to
consider<00:03:28.340> when<00:03:28.790> you're<00:03:28.849> going<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.359> maybe

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
consider when you're going for maybe

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.640 
consider when you're going for maybe
more<00:03:29.750> photorealistic<00:03:30.079> renderings<00:03:32.470> it's<00:03:33.470> not

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
more photorealistic renderings it's not

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.229 
more photorealistic renderings it's not
something<00:03:33.889> that's<00:03:34.099> really<00:03:34.370> required<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:35.060> mean

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
something that's really required I mean

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.240 
something that's really required I mean
if<00:03:35.419> I<00:03:35.599> took<00:03:35.840> that<00:03:36.019> off<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.709> render<00:03:37.040> this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
if I took that off and I render this

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.539 
if I took that off and I render this
again<00:03:37.579> it's<00:03:37.909> going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.120> render<00:03:38.299> quickly<00:03:39.549> and

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
again it's going to render quickly and

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.849 
again it's going to render quickly and
it<00:03:41.480> couldn't<00:03:41.750> really<00:03:41.870> say<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.469> it's<00:03:42.620> you

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
it couldn't really say that it's you

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.159 
it couldn't really say that it's you
know<00:03:42.889> that<00:03:43.280> much<00:03:43.609> worse<00:03:44.060> than<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.900> bump<00:03:45.079> map

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
know that much worse than the bump map

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.420 
know that much worse than the bump map
but<00:03:46.389> there<00:03:47.389> are<00:03:47.659> times<00:03:47.840> where<00:03:48.169> bump<00:03:48.799> mat<00:03:49.010> is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
but there are times where bump mat is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.089 
but there are times where bump mat is
useful<00:03:50.200> similarly<00:03:51.200> there's<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.560> displacement

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
useful similarly there's a displacement

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.180 
useful similarly there's a displacement
map<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.329> used<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:54.049> know<00:03:54.169> kind<00:03:54.409> of<00:03:54.500> on<00:03:54.769> a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
map this is used you know kind of on a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.099 
map this is used you know kind of on a
higher<00:03:55.549> level<00:03:55.579> I've<00:03:56.329> used<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.659> before<00:03:56.750> for

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
higher level I've used it before for

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.930 
higher level I've used it before for
bark<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.709> really<00:03:57.949> pushing<00:03:58.310> things<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.790> can

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
bark and really pushing things you can

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.789 
bark and really pushing things you can
use<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.269> for<00:03:59.419> terrain<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.139> really<00:04:00.349> push

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
use it for terrain and really push

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.520 
use it for terrain and really push
mountains<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.609> Earth<00:04:01.849> up<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.299> down<00:04:02.530> this

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
mountains of Earth up and down this

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.500 
mountains of Earth up and down this
isn't<00:04:03.859> always<00:04:04.010> small-scale<00:04:04.760> stuff<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.269> can<00:04:05.389> be

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
isn't always small-scale stuff it can be

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.710 
isn't always small-scale stuff it can be
used<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.900> much<00:04:06.199> much<00:04:06.439> higher<00:04:06.500> level<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:08.540> in

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
used in a much much higher level so in

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.750 
used in a much much higher level so in
the<00:04:08.840> next<00:04:09.109> kind<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.650> tutorial<00:04:10.069> here<00:04:10.400> we'll<00:04:10.639> be

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
the next kind of tutorial here we'll be

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.089 
the next kind of tutorial here we'll be
looking<00:04:10.909> at<00:04:11.209> changing<00:04:11.930> output<00:04:12.349> sizes<00:04:12.859> and

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
looking at changing output sizes and

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.280 
looking at changing output sizes and
kind<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.060> working<00:04:14.329> with<00:04:14.359> compositions<00:04:15.109> of

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
kind of working with compositions of

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.050 
kind of working with compositions of
cameras<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:15.829> that's<00:04:16.220> that's<00:04:16.579> all<00:04:16.729> done<00:04:16.909> in

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
cameras and that's that's all done in

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.749 
cameras and that's that's all done in
Rhino<00:04:17.299> with<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.690> composition<00:04:18.289> and<00:04:18.560> then<00:04:19.430> set<00:04:19.669> it

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
Rhino with a composition and then set it

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.310 
Rhino with a composition and then set it
up<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.120> running<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.449> through<00:04:20.479> v-ray<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.019> kind

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
up and running it through v-ray to kind

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.589 
up and running it through v-ray to kind
of<00:04:21.380> get<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.560> final<00:04:21.859> rendering<00:04:22.250> effect<00:04:22.669> we'll

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
of get that final rendering effect we'll

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.810 
of get that final rendering effect we'll
also<00:04:23.720> look<00:04:23.960> at<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.500> ability<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.220> kind<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.610> use

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
also look at the ability to kind of use

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.140 
also look at the ability to kind of use
some<00:04:25.849> presets<00:04:26.570> in<00:04:27.039> v-ray<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.220> achieve<00:04:28.909> you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
some presets in v-ray to achieve you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.009 
some presets in v-ray to achieve you
know<00:04:29.180> higher<00:04:29.599> level<00:04:30.050> resolution
