form let's try to understand what the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.790 
form let's try to understand what the
standard<00:00:19.859> form<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> complex<00:00:20.609> number<00:00:20.939> means

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
standard form of a complex number means

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
standard form of a complex number means
basically<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.130> represented<00:00:23.730> by<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.119> plus<00:00:24.510> bi

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
basically is represented by a plus bi

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.310 
basically is represented by a plus bi
where<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:26.210> represents<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.449> real<00:00:27.599> number<00:00:27.990> such

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
where a represents the real number such

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.549 
where a represents the real number such
as<00:00:28.429> 125<00:00:29.480> 37<00:00:30.480> plus<00:00:31.199> bi<00:00:31.500> where<00:00:32.460> B<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.559> basically

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
as 125 37 plus bi where B is basically

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.319 
as 125 37 plus bi where B is basically
the<00:00:34.710> coefficient<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.149> real

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the coefficient of I and is also a real

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
the coefficient of I and is also a real
number<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.969> imaginary<00:00:39.120> number<00:00:39.739> now

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
number and I is the imaginary number now

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
number and I is the imaginary number now
there's<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.010> rule<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> magic<00:00:41.790> number

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
there's a rule for the magic number

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.130 
there's a rule for the magic number
where<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.840> squared<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.680> equal<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.160> negative<00:00:44.190> 1

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
where i squared is equal to negative 1

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.630 
where i squared is equal to negative 1
so<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.440> back<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.950> question<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
so if you go back to our question and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
so if you go back to our question and
the<00:00:47.879> term<00:00:48.149> five<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> needs<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.590> changed

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the term five or I needs to be changed

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.729 
the term five or I needs to be changed
into<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> standard<00:00:50.670> form<00:00:51.320> what<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.620> with

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
into a standard form what do we do with

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.700 
into a standard form what do we do with
this<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> basically<00:00:54.000> multiply<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
this we have to basically multiply the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
this we have to basically multiply the
numerator<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> denominator<00:00:56.640> by<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
numerator and the denominator by the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
numerator and the denominator by the
conjugate<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> denominator<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
conjugate of the denominator which is I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.849 
conjugate of the denominator which is I
right<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> conjugate<00:01:01.559> mean

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
right now what is the conjugate mean

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
right now what is the conjugate mean
algea<00:01:02.640> means<00:01:02.879> where<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.329> change<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.930> sign<00:01:04.170> in

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
algea means where we change the sign in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
algea means where we change the sign in
the<00:01:04.409> middle<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.070> terms<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:06.210> example<00:01:06.570> we

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the middle of two terms for example we

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
the middle of two terms for example we
have<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.320> terms<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.650> which<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> three<00:01:08.729> plus

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
have two terms here which is three plus

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
have two terms here which is three plus
two<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.439> notice<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> standard

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
two I notice that it's in the standard

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
two I notice that it's in the standard
form<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> conjugate<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> three<00:01:14.100> plus<00:01:14.310> 2i

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
form so the conjugate of three plus 2i

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.080 
form so the conjugate of three plus 2i
will<00:01:14.909> basically<00:01:15.330> change<00:01:15.689> into<00:01:15.960> 3-2<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.090> which

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
will basically change into 3-2 I which

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.770 
will basically change into 3-2 I which
is<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.479> blue<00:01:18.750> loss<00:01:19.619> changes<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.280> minus

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
is see in blue loss changes into minus

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
is see in blue loss changes into minus
now<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.650> question<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
now if we go back to our question the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.390 
now if we go back to our question the
denominator<00:01:23.880> only<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.960> term<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:26.220> might

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
denominator only has one term you might

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.950 
denominator only has one term you might
have<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> question<00:01:27.060> saying<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.689> convert

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
have a question saying how do we convert

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.190 
have a question saying how do we convert
that<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.650> terms<00:01:28.920> well<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:30.750> we

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that into two terms well we could we

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.319 
that into two terms well we could we
could<00:01:31.320> basically<00:01:31.530> consider<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.030> 0<00:01:33.950> plus

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
could basically consider a to be 0 plus

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.859 
could basically consider a to be 0 plus
because<00:01:36.329> since<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.720> positive<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.259> won<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.869> if

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
because since it's positive i won I if

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.679 
because since it's positive i won I if
you<00:01:39.930> notice<00:01:40.400> 0+1<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> basically<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.710> +<00:01:44.220> 1

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
you notice 0+1 I is basically one I + 1

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.770 
you notice 0+1 I is basically one I + 1
times<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.049> basically<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:48.329> we're<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
times I is basically I so we're actually

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.510 
times I is basically I so we're actually
not<00:01:48.960> breaking<00:01:49.380> any<00:01:49.470> rules<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:50.280> basically

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
not breaking any rules this basically

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
not breaking any rules this basically
equals<00:01:51.180> 2<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.740> now<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.369> two<00:01:53.520> terms<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.119> we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
equals 2 I now we have two terms and we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800 
equals 2 I now we have two terms and we
simply<00:01:55.320> change<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.149> its<00:01:57.149> conjugate<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
simply change it into its conjugate and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
simply change it into its conjugate and
that<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.200> become<00:01:58.290> zero<00:01:58.920> minus<00:01:59.280> one<00:02:00.439> I<00:02:01.700> which

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
that will become zero minus one I which

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.700 
that will become zero minus one I which
in<00:02:02.909> turn<00:02:03.710> equals<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.610> negative<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
in turn equals to negative one I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.170 
in turn equals to negative one I
which<00:02:08.670> basically<00:02:08.850> equals<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.600> negative<00:02:10.200> hi<00:02:11.180> so

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
which basically equals to negative hi so

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.320 
which basically equals to negative hi so
the<00:02:12.600> conjugate<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.950> actually<00:02:14.670> negative

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the conjugate of I is actually negative

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.030 
the conjugate of I is actually negative
I<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.680> let's<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:16.980> back<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.190> our<00:02:17.370> question<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
I so let's go back to our question and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.330 
I so let's go back to our question and
we<00:02:20.040> would<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.400> multiply<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.630> numerator

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
we would like to multiply the numerator

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.510 
we would like to multiply the numerator
and<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:24.420> denominator<00:02:24.780> by<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.800> conjugate<00:02:26.069> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and the denominator by the conjugate of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.770 
and the denominator by the conjugate of
I<00:02:26.790> which<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.989> just<00:02:28.260> found<00:02:28.350> out<00:02:28.830> was<00:02:29.840> negative<00:02:30.840> I

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
I which we just found out was negative I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620 
I which we just found out was negative I
ok<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.590> let's<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.760> multiply<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> top

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
ok so let's do that so multiply the top

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:45.920 
ok so let's do that so multiply the top
by<00:02:41.090> negative<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.459> bottom<00:02:44.850> by<00:02:45.269> negative

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
by negative I and the bottom by negative

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.380 
by negative I and the bottom by negative
I<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:48.360> would<00:02:48.630> actually<00:02:48.890> give<00:02:49.890> us

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
I and this would actually give us

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.860 
I and this would actually give us
negative<00:02:51.620> 5i<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.910> numerator<00:02:55.010> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
negative 5i in the numerator and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.990 
negative 5i in the numerator and
negative<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.820> square<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.690> denominator

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
negative I square and the denominator

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.130 
negative I square and the denominator
okay<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:04.019> we<00:03:04.290> take<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.920> closer<00:03:05.220> look<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.989> can

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
okay so if we take a closer look we can

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.160 
okay so if we take a closer look we can
simplify<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:08.160> term<00:03:08.489> now<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.420> as<00:03:09.630> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
simplify this term now because as you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.930 
simplify this term now because as you
can<00:03:10.230> see<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.500> role<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.709> imaginary<00:03:11.250> i<00:03:11.489> squared

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
can see the role of imaginary i squared

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.080 
can see the role of imaginary i squared
is<00:03:12.030> equal<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.420> negative<00:03:12.450> 1<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.880> could

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
is equal to negative 1 so we could

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.500 
is equal to negative 1 so we could
basically<00:03:15.739> substitute<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.950> squared<00:03:17.850> with

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
basically substitute I squared with

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.720 
basically substitute I squared with
negative<00:03:18.930> 1<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.410> denominator<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.549> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
negative 1 in the denominator so the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.009 
negative 1 in the denominator so the
numerator<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.329> going<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.600> stay<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> same<00:03:22.110> and

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
numerator is going to stay the same and

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:32.530 
numerator is going to stay the same and
the<00:03:25.019> denominator<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:26.450> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.930> change<00:03:29.900> into

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the denominator is going to change into

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.780 
the denominator is going to change into
negative

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.390 

negative<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:39.120> okay<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:41.349> you<00:03:41.440> notice<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:42.220> i

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
negative one okay so you notice that i

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.020 
negative one okay so you notice that i
squared<00:03:42.910> changed<00:03:43.840> into<00:03:44.170> negative<00:03:44.739> one

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
squared changed into negative one

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.190 
squared changed into negative one
because<00:03:46.030> there's<00:03:46.239> still<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.450> negative<00:03:46.810> outside

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
because there's still a negative outside

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.119 
because there's still a negative outside
so<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.560> becomes<00:03:47.970> negative<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.150> negative<00:03:49.660> one

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
so it becomes negative of negative one

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:57.809 
so it becomes negative of negative one
which<00:03:52.110> would<00:03:53.110> equal<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:54.670> negative<00:03:55.629> 5i<00:03:56.590> in<00:03:57.340> the

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
which would equal to negative 5i in the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.600 
which would equal to negative 5i in the
numerator<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:02.190> positive<00:04:03.190> 1<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.519> the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
numerator and positive 1 in the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.970 
numerator and positive 1 in the
denominator<00:04:03.640> because<00:04:04.629> negative<00:04:05.349> times<00:04:05.860> a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
denominator because negative times a

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.190 
denominator because negative times a
negative<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.430> positive<00:04:07.860> which<00:04:08.860> would<00:04:09.459> equal

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
negative is positive which would equal

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:19.379 
negative is positive which would equal
to<00:04:11.200> negative<00:04:11.940> 5i<00:04:13.290> because<00:04:16.470> negative<00:04:17.470> 5i<00:04:18.389> over

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
to negative 5i because negative 5i over

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.180 
to negative 5i because negative 5i over
one<00:04:19.739> would<00:04:20.739> equal<00:04:21.280> negative<00:04:22.240> 5i<00:04:23.080> any<00:04:23.440> number

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
one would equal negative 5i any number

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.120 
one would equal negative 5i any number
that<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.639> divided<00:04:25.090> by<00:04:25.270> one<00:04:25.680> would<00:04:26.680> equal<00:04:27.010> to

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
that is divided by one would equal to

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.640 
that is divided by one would equal to
the<00:04:27.220> number<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.030> was<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.380> was<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.530> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
the number that it was that was in the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.830 
the number that it was that was in the
numerator<00:04:31.080> okay<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.530> we<00:04:33.340> have<00:04:33.370> solved<00:04:34.150> this

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
numerator okay so we have solved this

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.860 
numerator okay so we have solved this
