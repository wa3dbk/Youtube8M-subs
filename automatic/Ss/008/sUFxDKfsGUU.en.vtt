00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
android devices in the corner one of the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.800 
android devices in the corner one of the
corners<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.790> house<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.479> walked

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
corners of my house and then walked

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.389 
corners of my house and then walked
around<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.350> rest<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.860> house<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
around the rest of my house with this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.210 
around the rest of my house with this
thing<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:51.299> my<00:01:51.540> hand<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.979> worked

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
thing in my hand and and it worked

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.069 
thing in my hand and and it worked
perfectly<00:01:53.850> well<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
perfectly well so all the way on the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.200 
perfectly well so all the way on the
other<00:01:55.140> side<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> house<00:01:55.890> behind<00:01:56.610> walls

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
other side of the house behind walls

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
other side of the house behind walls
basically<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> signal<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.310> had

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
basically the signal was really good had

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.359 
basically the signal was really good had
really<00:02:00.329> good<00:02:00.509> sound<00:02:00.990> quality<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.219> thing

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
really good sound quality and the thing

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.240 
really good sound quality and the thing
I<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:04.250> water-resistant

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
I like about it is it is water-resistant

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.359 
I like about it is it is water-resistant
so<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.840> basic<00:02:07.369> waterproof

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
so so it has the basic waterproof

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.669 
so so it has the basic waterproof
water-resistant<00:02:09.270> seals<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.410> can

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
water-resistant seals on it so you can

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.410 
water-resistant seals on it so you can
take<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.160> outside<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.120> there's<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
take this outside and if there's a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
take this outside and if there's a
little<00:02:12.569> bit<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> rain<00:02:13.050> or<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:13.410> you're<00:02:13.530> by

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
little bit of rain or if you're by

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I a pool or something you don't have to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.930 
I a pool or something you don't have to
worry<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.410> those<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.860> things<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.310> are

nice long battery life one of the cool
things<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.220> guys<00:02:26.550> might<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.820> beyond<00:02:27.390> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
things you guys might like beyond that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.440 
things you guys might like beyond that
is<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.990> can<00:02:28.110> actually<00:02:28.140> also<00:02:28.860> pair<00:02:29.460> up<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.210> two

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
is you can actually also pair up to two

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.510 
is you can actually also pair up to two
devices<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.530> lot<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> Bluetooth

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
devices with this a lot of the Bluetooth

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.160 
devices with this a lot of the Bluetooth
devices<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.060> only<00:02:33.270> pair<00:02:33.570> one<00:02:33.870> device

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
devices you can only pair one device

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.260 
devices you can only pair one device
with<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.190> actually<00:02:35.550> pair<00:02:35.970> two

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
with this you can actually pair two

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.440 
with this you can actually pair two
devices<00:02:36.600> at<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.050> same<00:02:37.500> time<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.550> one<00:02:39.090> device

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
devices at the same time so one device

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.750 
devices at the same time so one device
can<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.810> playing<00:02:40.170> music<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.220> stop<00:02:41.520> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
can be playing music you can stop that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.580 
can be playing music you can stop that
device<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.540> another<00:02:42.840> device<00:02:43.260> play

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
device and have another device play

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.260 
device and have another device play
music<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.550> don't<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.120> through

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
music and you don't have to go through

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.670 
music and you don't have to go through
the<00:02:45.390> whole<00:02:45.510> pairing<00:02:45.900> process<00:02:46.050> right<00:02:46.500> at<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the whole pairing process right at that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.670 
the whole pairing process right at that
moment<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.430> they<00:02:47.550> both<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.510> paired<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
moment so they both can be paired and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.140 
moment so they both can be paired and
then<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.460> switch<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:50.940> forth

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
then you can just switch back and forth

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.180 
then you can just switch back and forth
so<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.600> you're<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.260> an<00:02:52.350> iphone<00:02:52.890> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so if you're if you have an iphone and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.490 
so if you're if you have an iphone and
an<00:02:53.640> Android<00:02:54.120> device<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.960> come<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.320> play

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
an Android device you come and play

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.040 
an Android device you come and play
music<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> iPhone<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:57.300> hit<00:02:57.450> pause<00:02:57.690> there

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
music on the iPhone you hit pause there

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.690 
music on the iPhone you hit pause there
you<00:02:58.410> go<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.560> your<00:02:58.680> android<00:02:58.980> device<00:02:59.010> hit<00:02:59.430> play

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
you go to your android device hit play

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.850 
you go to your android device hit play
and<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.450> starts<00:03:00.750> playing<00:03:00.990> music<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.560> really

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
my little my little a demo area here so

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.400 
my little my little a demo area here so
I<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.180> show<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:07.050> bit<00:03:07.170> more
