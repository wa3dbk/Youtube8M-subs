00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.959
 in 2004 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.259
 that where they get excited there we are in 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.960
 minecraft this ready widget 0.11 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.849
 point units modest pretty chingÃ³n 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.619
 He already mentioned that a very cool 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.170
 jetpack adds a bucket of energy or 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.119
 each solid to be able to recharge it and not 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.090
 a propeller is added to be able to change 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.070
 our jetpack and do out there the 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.570
 delay so that having said that 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.220
 Now let's go to our dearest friend 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.980
 Mr. you to see craft of these 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.720
 so cute things we click next to 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.579
 we would have the jetpack the bucket and the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.829
 propeller let's see first how it 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.570
 craft the the propeller that is with iron 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.910
 and coal quoted that I already say that the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.379
 Graffiti artists are quite easy going 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.750
 to see how the energy cube grows 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.820
 which is with coal and a lava cube 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.219
 let's see finally how you get to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.530
 the jetpack that is quite important 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.559
 this because if not we will not be able to fly 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.230
 and to be the one who stays with iron 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.320
 diamond and two thrusters we did not go out 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.729
 so it's time to try it 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.380
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.390
 go on a kraft table or we give 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.310
 click and here we would have the jetpack what 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.150
 we would have to recharge as we see in 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.480
 the jet asks for them 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.370
 and an energy cube we click and 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.620
 once doing this our team already 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.750
 It would be loaded and we could not anymore 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.160
 we could place it there we have it and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.740
 now yes partners are ready and 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.690
 bursts of fire at me and it's that this takes 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.300
 is super epic chan chan chan chan chan 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.700

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.310
 pretty amazing bot to go from 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.230
 here for there for here but the truth 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.720
 is that gasoline performs quite well and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.850
 we are already seeing that it is incredible 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.920
 Bursts of fire are the best the truth 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.240
 So I pretty impressive 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.050
 quite impressed and I hope that 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.400
 you also because if not the bursts 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.530
 of fire are the best 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.090
 chan chan chan chan chan thus is that the 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.010

 to do the principle we go down 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.850
 we go to our cracking table with 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.980
 our jetpack and the power cube and 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.020
 we go here and there I will not go out and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.140
