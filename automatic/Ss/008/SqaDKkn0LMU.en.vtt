00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.569
 ben hamo dari sonohra for welcome in 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.640
 this new spotlight welcome back to me 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.650
 that after a week around doing 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.850
 many videos will know the reason 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.290
 while others do not 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.140
 in practice I had written it on the page 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.500
 facebook a few days ago the computer 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.510
 we say yes it was destroyed it was a lot and da 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.119
 a few days on for a few days 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.280
 the man was repaired and could not 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.840
 make videos from the beginning because they are 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.180
 engaged with the study the last ones 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.379
 queries last tasks then the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.319
 school now that is ending let's say with 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:42.149
 these last days are back to doing 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:45.609
 video completely video channel 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.870
 day by day a TV version too 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.359
 because I try the new version will come out 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.620
 or 1.6 I'm seeing the various 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.670
 snapshots that are also very beautiful and and 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.350
 anything 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.329
 follow me on the facebook page because 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.129
 I write a lot of news and so on 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.899
 if you do n't, he went to do it now and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.780
 I decided to do the acre soldier mode 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.289
 for my return because because it is the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.049
 first great that happened to me by eye 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.369
 immediately because I wanted to do 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.159
 this video as soon as possible 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.840
 they were able to make a mistake two days ago 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.060
 when I returned the computer I have 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.490
 decided to do this the first way 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.079
 it happened to me to do this 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.859
 video as soon as possible also because not 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.280
 I had as I said time to find 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:36.520
 other fashions and therefore this short time 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.259
 I'll tell you a little about what fashion adds 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.509
 you all know, however, the edge is there 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.310
 same in practice the fashion come 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.920
 clay soldiers or play and that 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.130
 material found in the seabed 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.950
 and picking up the card you will keep 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.850
 these soldiers you can fight for 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 among them 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.770
 of course you can make those fight 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.590
 which are different in color but blue 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 sap yellow to note while brown 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.899
 then they fight a very beautiful thing and a lot 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.119
 nice that adds the mode are the 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.240
 animals or you can ride 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.410
 turtles 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.450
 buffalo or let's say horses or even 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.250
 flying horses however adds 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.040
 lots of stuff and we can even see 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.880
 we tools such as the object 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.500
 which destroys all of these 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.430
 move all these soldiers these 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 monsters but what I say and is an object instead 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.480
 which allows you to dispute yourself and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.640
 to multiply them 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.860
 it's a really cool thing and this one 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.720
 moderate I recommend a lot because how 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 I said already in other videos is one of the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.070
 mo fork is a mod that everyone must 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.700
 have own minecraft minecraft why 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.840
 was never created much more fun and 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.540
 nothing fashion adds just this 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.180
 naturally there will also be soldiers 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.490
 specials that we say are much more 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.050
 strong or have characteristics 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.760
 different from the others and now that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.000
 I explained to you a bit how mode vi 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.630
 I say the latest information here 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.090
 practice in the video of the famous request 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.480

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.190
 joking videos or serious videos anyway 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.910
