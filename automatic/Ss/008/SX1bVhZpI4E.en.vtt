because<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> nature<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:22.950> what<00:03:23.099> we<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.340> here

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
because of the nature of what we do here

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.250 
because of the nature of what we do here
at<00:03:23.639> big<00:03:23.790> run<00:03:24.000> we<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.359> go<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.840> handle<00:03:25.169> all

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
at big run we do go in and handle all

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.460 
at big run we do go in and handle all
the<00:03:25.410> animals<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:25.980> naturally<00:03:27.079> he<00:03:28.079> doesn't<00:03:28.349> have

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
the animals so naturally he doesn't have

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.039 
the animals so naturally he doesn't have
to<00:03:28.590> defend<00:03:29.340> himself<00:03:29.549> or<00:03:30.090> dig<00:03:30.510> for<00:03:30.690> food<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.989> I

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
to defend himself or dig for food and I

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.479 
to defend himself or dig for food and I
think<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.349> going<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> handle<00:03:32.190> here<00:03:32.220> if

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
think it's going to be a handle here if

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.830 
think it's going to be a handle here if
he<00:03:32.609> was<00:03:32.760> not<00:03:32.910> declawed<00:03:33.329> well<00:03:33.480> then<00:03:33.599> we<00:03:33.690> would

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
he was not declawed well then we would

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.420 
he was not declawed well then we would
not<00:03:33.959> be<00:03:34.019> able<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.290> come<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.980> pretty
