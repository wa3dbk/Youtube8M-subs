00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.559
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.059
 Welcome to the prediction clip 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.630
 forecasting center of the German 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.250
 weather service 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.320
 let's take a look at the current one 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.880
 weather conditions we realize that 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.460
 Germany between a deep over 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.199
 eastern europe and a high far outside 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.970
 on the Atlantic lies because of the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.980
 actions high straight off 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.170
 in between, the bars are crowded 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.090
 that means we have to 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.920
 one wind and another 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.140
 constantly air here around the deep 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.820
 and especially here at the alps and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.720
 in the Erzgebirge for that constantly too 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.040
 tax effects 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.170
 believe that a bit looser 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 out there is then to shiver and 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.380
 thunderstorm 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.760
 We look now to the Council for 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.649
 tomorrow the rain came yesterday 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.670
 This is about you have to 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.899
 imagine 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.390
 and now let's get started 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.100
 to look back rain came quite massive 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.140
 is the rain from the east direction 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.820
 come to the southwest and see it up here 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 we shiver and thunder today 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.960
 have activated again 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.430
 the whole same again a giant 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.130
 mass of rain 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 that has poured without end and in the north 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.249
 See who the static clouds 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.399
 because they are the current ones here 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:13.990
 winner ethic advice arrive are there 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.329
 We are not surprised that it has been 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.969
 yesterday afternoon until today at 14 o'clock 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.639
 It has been raining a lot 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.619
 roughly roughly two-thirds of the month 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.810
 rainfall is in 24 hours down 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.060
 come and as we here I see the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.929
 southeastern half of germany completely 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.599
 represent 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.520
 as not all will record but 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:35.859
 are just examples of one against the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.689
 is the alps area thats that 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.969
 Erzgebirge here we come for example 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.159
 in the black forest only lindenberg field 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.779
 out that is in the northeast but there has 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.679
 today with the showers and thunderstorms 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:48.520
 who have looked away altogether 31 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.739
 liter given 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.179
 Let's take a look at the current election card 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.399
 below clearly the ground 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.439
 the area of ​​the traffic jam up here is straight 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.509
 of course we have a little break 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.340
 continue the thunderstorm warning respectively 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.349
 here in the fields of wins make 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.849
 we saw how close the iso 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.669
 others are located 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.670
 how does that go on you barely see one 

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:11.650
 difference still in the East 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.510
 a high in the west and here with 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.700
 Farther 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.769
 air against the alb and against the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.780
 Erzgebirge controlled a small one 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.620
 difference is that this is high 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 slowly get in to us now 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.280
 Let's look at the prediction movie for 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 the precipitation for tomorrow 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.620
 and there we are so firm that 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.750
 continue a 3 direction here is here 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.269
 down in the old rich docks there 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.519
 above, there are some thunderstorms here 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.349
 something jams and during the day because 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.359
 the whole thing merged into one line 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.430
 here in the repetition of the old traffic jam 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.680
 here the individual areas and in the course 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 of the day to the solid line 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.040
 heavy precipitation is here too 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.200
 expect 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.760
 the weather accordingly loosens it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.500
 every now and then but there are also 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.620
 thunderstorm down here we have the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.519
 Constant rain and north and west exist 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.840
 occasionally showers 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.540
 but there is also the sun 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.959
 To look often it is best here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.209
 where the thunderstorms and showers occur in the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.340
 west we reach only 14 degrees and in 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.670
 south in the constant rain when wonder 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.720
 only 12 13 degrees 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.040
 accordingly the bet went 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.319
 I have the thick signs there 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.910
 put down where it is extreme weather 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.220
 there is, it can be a day well 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.010
 100 liters of precipitation fall here 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.609
 in the area we have 60 70 liters too 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.379
 expect 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.579
 and up here the precipitate will be fine 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.410
 mainly from thunderstorms 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.790
 come 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.440
 the other prospects look there who 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.989
 quite stupid from the laundry at once where 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.489
 he is quite rainy now 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.750
 sunday we still see some in the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.790
 southeast that takes a bit longer 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.660
 so far as goes away here too loud 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.609
 is still affected 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.160
 and otherwise sun clouds and no 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.169
 rain that we are amazed but who 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.549
 has paid attention to the hab 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.139
 I explained that 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.629
 high pressure area slowly after 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.549
 Unfortunately, Germany purely works 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.919
 the air coming from the north, the 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.030
 means the temperatures do not rise 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.040
 too clearly 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.010
 maybe on tuesday only wants to create 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.530
 in the middle the 1 20 degrees 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.599
 but note the uv radiation 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.669
 It does not really care how warm 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.169
 it is on the ground you have to get one 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.849
 crow when they go in the sun 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.030
 we finally have the time shortly before 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.329
 the solstice that was that 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.799
 weather forecast from the 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.430
 forecasting center of the German 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.270
 weather service 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.669
 and bye german weather service 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.669
 weather and climate from a single source
