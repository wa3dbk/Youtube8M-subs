00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Testament which we really ought now to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.750 
Testament which we really ought now to
be<00:01:19.290> able<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.620> say<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.010> time<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.460> lot

back together again and when you do that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
back together again and when you do that
it's<00:01:22.740> explosive<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.630> lot<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.780> Jesus<00:01:24.960> parables

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it's explosive a lot of Jesus parables

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's explosive a lot of Jesus parables
are<00:01:25.799> told<00:01:26.100> precisely<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.090> order<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> say<00:01:27.750> no

the<00:01:28.590> kingdom<00:01:28.950> isn't<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.939> thought<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the kingdom isn't what you thought it

was<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.170> story<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.799> Gospels<00:01:32.219> tell<00:01:32.549> which<00:01:33.240> is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
was the story the Gospels tell which is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
was the story the Gospels tell which is
how<00:01:33.930> God<00:01:34.229> became<00:01:34.409> King<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.939> think

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
how God became King is one that I think

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.539 
how God became King is one that I think
the<00:01:36.210> whole<00:01:36.450> Western<00:01:36.899> world<00:01:36.930> has<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:38.009> only<00:01:38.280> not
