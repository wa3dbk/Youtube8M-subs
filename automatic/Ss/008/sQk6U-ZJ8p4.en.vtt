00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.770
 friends, hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.259
 channel digital game my name is Andrei 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.019
 as promised I want to share with you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.880
 review mini reviews more precisely microphone 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.720
 who bought for commenting games 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 here is this marshal electronics firm 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.699
 model mxl 990 hut 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 There is no such thing yet with my xlr 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 connector we need an amplifier for it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 phantom power there is a mixer and so 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.960
 then this one just connects like this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.770
 here we are drawn to a laptop or 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 computer and immediately gives a wonderful sound 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.340
 charge what it took let's from the microphone 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.620
 let's start here to be honest i just have to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.800
 mail came ie it is not even his 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.859
 I tried immediately took and took to do 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.750
 shoot this review as the yard is already 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.799
 dark I would like to catch a microphone 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.229
 metal is probably aluminum 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.000
 the mesh is also metallic, even the cap 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.810
 shining if well 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.130
 take a closer look weighs 400 grams think 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.170
 no less here so it looks like it is not here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.920
 no indicator adjustments 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 I do not know the switches for such a price 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 I think 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 at least some kind of light indicator 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:44.520
 put it so easy not clear 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:48.270
 whether it is connected or not so it looks like 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 these look at the kit this part 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.240
 mounts well collect in this video I'm him 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.409
 I will not because with one hand I hold the camera 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 in the second I showed you the kit 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 I don't have a tripod, so excuse usb 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.129
 cable cable to cable here and usb 2 0 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.099
 here is such a thing 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.710
 I've already seen this somewhere on the printer 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.500
 or at 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:21.520
 All this is probably a kind and usb or 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.060
 beat someone as it is more convenient to say this 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.270
 tripod 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.880
 such are these legs 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.880
 completely metal here such here 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.930
 chromed 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.110
 Well, there is such a gum 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.080
 nozzle so as not to slide on the surface 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.080
 on which we stand and reveal 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.890
 open yourself you are like this 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:59.200
 Here is such a plastic plastic here 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:05.980
 his model is written m xl 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.720
 but rather a series of such a pen for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.930
 carrying 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.070
 Well, a bunch of waste paper did not even read 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:23.590
 read something at least how to collect 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:30.010
 I think I'll figure it out okay no one 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:33.750
 interesting warning some free 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.160
 soft for download it probably 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.370
 software which 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.800
 offered to him for setting okay 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 here that it is not written marshal 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.170
 where is it only in such small letters 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.170
 there is minimal technical 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.170
 specifications 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:05.730
 6 micron gold is written on the diaphragm 22 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.730
 millimeter diaphragm itself 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.150
 still need to be such a pop filter 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:19.070
 buy but it's not now the other day 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.550
 I think I'll take 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.750
 choose between him between blue yeti 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:30.960
 the price is basically the same I bought it 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.360
 for 210 dollars that's where I bought talk 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.850
 I will not and they will say ads dizlike here 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.669
 such a microphone I hope to work 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:49.010
 okay, well, thank you all for 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.010
