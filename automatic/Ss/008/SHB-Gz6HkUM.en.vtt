00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.690
 I want to devote short video lessons 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.219
 newcomers buildings slideshow 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 if you have never had anything like it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 didn't create or maybe 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.300
 well, you all got this course 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 The daguer with the heads of this will suit you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
 Xenia look like this I unfortunately 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.869
 you can not see can not wave leave 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 I will look at the comment 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 we will use you program 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.420
 passed the producer ate very often mention 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 I have a lesson on my website about how 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.540
 correctly install this program on 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.579
 your computer and for certify 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 so it’s not difficult for years 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.510
 it's all just out of it to be engaged with 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.000
 I guess I'll let you leave this 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.739
 link in the description of this video something 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 no problem or installed and transferred 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.340
 Immediately practice, see me at work 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 the desktop has a created folder with 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 files, I recommend you to create 30 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.000
 slide show and also for your file to put 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
 passive folder is better of course they are on me 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.629
 I have a desktop here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 photos I will use them in 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.380
 slides 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.689
 Based on these sites, how do you study 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.540
 the basic functions of the program that you 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 then come in handy in the slideshow and here 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.259
 I also have music by the way 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.150
 free license is distributed and we 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.060
 to you any copyright not 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.200
 Fortunately, I still have a video 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.900
 I will use it as 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.909
 footage and if you don't know such footage 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.090
 you will soon learn working with such 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.470
 pieces this is a background video for under 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 photo for slideshow 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.549
 let's see what it looks like 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.549
 interface of our program 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 Now we have the wizard window opened immediately 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.900
 creating presentations let's close this 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.930
 surely a cool thing to find 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.580
 some tell about it another time 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.159
 at the top we go to the navigation 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 ruler just below are located 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.170
 presentation slideshow tools here 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.180
 we have guides you can 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.920
 find the folder you created and where 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.409
 put photos for slideshow 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.509
 I will immediately open my folder here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.380
 the desktop icon is called here 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.560
 actually she 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.540
 here are 2 photos here is music on the right 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.239
 This is the usual preview window. 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.700
 buttons here you want in full screen pride 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.209
 you want to watch not in full screen 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.300
 what do you want below our panel 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.980
 peshkova slides I use slides and us 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.440
 this window will come in handy 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.970
 for then we will put I will not go 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.769
 you immediately show how to add 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 photos of music in the presentation because 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.510
 that I generally think that the presentation 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.220
 should start title slide 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.959
 no, of course you can add 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.549
 any picture or anything else come 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.900
 weakness then the first slide which 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 will include exclusively 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.950
 inscriptions that are somehow stylized 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.299
 appears and disappears 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.250
 I suggest first creating a blank layer 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.829
 for this we press plus slide and we 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.659
 slide bars get this 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.180
 slide but look what we did 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.129
 This is a black background and I like dogs in 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.620
 little fingers road black background car no me 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.599
 Of course I like to add better after all 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.720
 We change it to something more light 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.340
 so choose presentations 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.840
 presentation fund and I will tell you right away 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.790
 introduce you to this window 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.430
 here you can set the settings by 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.670
 default for your presentation and i tell you 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.889
 show on the example of the background you want to put 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.799
 yourself with modulations you want to speckled up 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.909
 you like it so much and choose i press ok and 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.670
 now everything suits me much 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.250
 more war the key to the slide I opened 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.109
 parameters window toledo here is something 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.030
 it is immediately incomprehensible but you do not need 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.190
 understand like this only find this one 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.530
 block where inscriptions are written click on the plus sign 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.750
 immediately we have an empty form 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.660
 lettering but we are not here lettering is not here 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.190

 we can enter your inscription come on 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.629
 write something to the premiere 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.330
 here we write a 1. 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.849
 I see good, darling we can 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.400
 move around the preview screen here 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.130
 that's what you like 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.050
 You can immediately change its size I turn 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 she will be called by me 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.740
 I did it for a reason 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.629

 and you there will be a little less because 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.220
