00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.300
 if you evoke the island of fussy you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.320
 dream of sublime plant pamiers 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.770
 in dream scenery 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 in short an island paradise certainly the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 dream could quickly break and if one 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590
 you say fussy in the cotentin and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.080
 yet it is a paradise that we 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.519
 let's go talk and everything starts with a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.740
 ship straight out of a band 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.790
 drawn to the Rheims are in charge of the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.170
 Botanical Garden of Tatihou Island 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 so tatihou island being a small 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.149
 island located east of Cotentin so the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.550
 tatihou garden has two themes 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.469
 essential 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.430
 a theme that represents the flora 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 maritime issues and a theme 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.820
 acclimation garden formerly called 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 also exotic garden 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.229
 the two parts being separated by lazard 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.119
 and no speakers that date back to vauban 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.220
 and each part does so about 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.220
 equal area ie 3 hectares 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 three and a half hectares there is little 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.950
 around 1000 tac are different over 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 300 attacks are indigenous that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 represents all the plants that can be 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.180
 find by the sea essentially 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 on normandy brittany too 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.659
 also some plants to the south 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 from France and then the famous garden 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.049
 acclimatization so it was found 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.759
 essentially plant 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.770
 the southern hemisphere as well as plants 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.119
 Mediterranean 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.380
 so the idea of ​​these gardens was to 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.740
 already promote the horticultural quality 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.680
 cotentin which is a small territory 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 but extremely privileged 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.770
 on average over the year we can have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.149
 some very sweet years a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.549
 amplitude of 10 degrees which is 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.850
 extremely weak 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 it allows us to acclimatize plants 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.390
 from truly cosmopolitan origins 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.680
 as well in south africa new 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.380
 zealand two Mediterranean regions 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.520
 without much difficulty 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.360
 because there is interesting precisely 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.830
 it is able to do in conditions 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.480
 real all these experiences of 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.060
 plants which for the most part 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.190
 regions are are said to be plants 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.020
 of orangery that is to say we are 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.370
 forced to grow them in containers and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.260
 wintering that we can not keep them at 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.470
 outside in our gardens we can 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.710
 see avocados and grow on 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.360
 can see figs and tropical such 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.510
 that the strangler fig tree of the same 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.690
 fructify there are rate plans that are 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.600
 downright remarkable which are followed 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.340
 by the antennas of the museum of stories 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.910
 natural such as acacia tile 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.730
 as has regained it such as some 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.940
 ficus that literally proliferate without 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.550
 no protection 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.730
 we can also see a collection of 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.300
 Canarian plants relatively 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 interesting what are the niyum heroes 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.620
 who looks like big bard cheeks 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.920
 but which forms small shrubs with 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.850
 different and lush foliage 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.830
 so this passion for plants 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.380
 succulent I have since since my 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.090
 childhood actually I had the opportunity to 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.710
 recover an agave the exercise being 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.290
 and when I finally could acquire a 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.790
 small plot to create a garden 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.260
 a character the plants is in and 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.270
 Moreover, they are always there 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.700
 and I have other satisfaction also 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.510
 because of my management for the moment 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.370
 always without any chemicals 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.470
 to say that the aisles are made without 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:54.820
 manually treat the beds are 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.930
 circled by hand without any artifice 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:03.980
 chemically and selectively 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.720
 so since we could see appear or 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.850
 explode orchid populations that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.690
 of 6 me even laziness about 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.310
 walls and a very funny side 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.480
 observe is the adaptation of 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.850
 goldfinches 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.660
 at the flagship plant of the site that clubs 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.090
 pinana taking them as support for 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.070
 their edification 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.699
 it's still pretty funny to see this 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.000
 small bird exotic appearance all colorful 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.940
 all adorable leap within this 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.979
 giant flower to go feed his 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.050
 just hang on among the hundreds 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.729
 thousands of flowers 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.710
 the notion of the garden is closer rather 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.229
 from the garden of Eden you seem to me 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.780
 really indispensable and this has for 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.090
 purpose of accentuating biodiversity and more 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.430
 we are increasing biodiversity and we are 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.710
 realizes that in a garden goes life 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.820
 explodes the beautiful things always have 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.900
 an end 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.940
 in this place where even the lights 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.410
 brings magic it's under the screams 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.389
 and the gulls master parades 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.830
 places you will return to the mainland 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.830
 images full eyes
