quad exhaust from here down is all

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530 
quad exhaust from here down is all
carbon<00:01:27.900> fiber<00:01:28.670> not<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.210> makes

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
carbon fiber not that that really makes

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.190 
carbon fiber not that that really makes
it<00:01:30.689> lighter<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:31.229> anything<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.890> cool
