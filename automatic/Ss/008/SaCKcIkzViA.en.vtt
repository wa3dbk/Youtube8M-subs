can find out if there's a new release of
mesh<00:00:59.550> mixer<00:00:59.699> every<00:01:00.059> time<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> start<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.570> up

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
mesh mixer every time you start it up

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.039 
mesh mixer every time you start it up
just<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> glance<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:03.930> thing

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
just have a glance so the first thing

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.509 
just have a glance so the first thing
you<00:01:04.140> obviously<00:01:04.979> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> start

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
you obviously want to do when you start

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
you obviously want to do when you start
mesh<00:01:05.820> mixer<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.810> files<00:01:07.170> in

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
mesh mixer is you want to get files in

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.980 
mesh mixer is you want to get files in
here<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> work<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> mesh<00:01:09.150> mixer<00:01:09.299> you're

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
here to work on so in mesh mixer you're

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
here to work on so in mesh mixer you're
always<00:01:10.229> importing<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> scene<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.670> then

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
always importing into the scene and then

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.250 
always importing into the scene and then
you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> save<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.420> load<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.750> mesh<00:01:12.930> mixers

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you can save and load in mesh mixers

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
you can save and load in mesh mixers
custom<00:01:13.680> format<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> import<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> can

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
custom format so the import you can

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
custom format so the import you can
import<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.930> ways<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.009> import<00:01:17.310> using

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
import in two ways you can import using

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
import in two ways you can import using
these<00:01:18.540> buttons<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> scene<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
these buttons up here when the scene is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
these buttons up here when the scene is
empty<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> action<00:01:21.060> bar<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> these

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.410 
action bar button first and I've just
got<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> bunch<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> objects<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.270> are

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
got a bunch of objects here that are

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.569 
got a bunch of objects here that are
sort<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> useful<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> start<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
sort of useful to start from the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.030 
sort of useful to start from the
starting<00:01:44.909> point<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.240> here's<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:45.750> example<00:01:46.040> I'll

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
starting point so here's an example I'll

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
starting point so here's an example I'll
just<00:01:47.100> show<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.060> replace<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
just show you if want to replace this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
just show you if want to replace this
we'd<00:01:48.840> go<00:01:48.960> file<00:01:49.259> import<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.070> when<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
we'd go file import and when you do that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.980 
we'd go file import and when you do that
it's<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.000> ask<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it's gonna ask you if you want to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's gonna ask you if you want to
replace<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.649> object<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.250> add<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
replace this object or add to it so you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
replace this object or add to it so you
probably<00:01:54.509> want<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> replace<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.470> unless<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
probably want to replace it unless you

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
probably want to replace it unless you
know<00:01:56.549> why<00:01:56.820> you'd<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> add<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
know why you'd want to add to it so

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
know why you'd want to add to it so
let's<00:01:59.070> say<00:01:59.250> let's<00:01:59.490> take<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.790> diamond<00:02:00.090> object

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
let's say let's take this diamond object

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.899 
let's say let's take this diamond object
and<00:02:01.170> it'll<00:02:01.710> change<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.340> object<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and it'll change the object that's in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.249 
and it'll change the object that's in
there

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
there

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.959 
there
now<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.860> moving<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> camera<00:02:05.430> around<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
now I'm moving the camera around and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
now I'm moving the camera around and
looking<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.450> different<00:02:06.540> angles<00:02:07.140> I'm

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
looking at it from different angles I'm

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.780 
looking at it from different angles I'm
using<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.680> hotkeys<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.550> right<00:02:08.729> now

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
using some hotkeys to do that right now

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.760 
using some hotkeys to do that right now
the<00:02:10.150> hotkeys<00:02:10.630> I'm<00:02:11.050> using<00:02:11.290> I'm<00:02:11.500> holding<00:02:11.740> down

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the hotkeys I'm using I'm holding down

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.130 
the hotkeys I'm using I'm holding down
the<00:02:11.980> Alt<00:02:12.130> key<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.430> using<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.000> left<00:02:13.210> right<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
the Alt key and using the left right and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.940 
the Alt key and using the left right and
middle<00:02:14.950> mouse<00:02:15.280> buttons<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:17.170> those<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.830> might

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
middle mouse buttons but those you might

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.350 
middle mouse buttons but those you might
not<00:02:18.100> have<00:02:18.280> those<00:02:18.460> mouse<00:02:18.670> buttons<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.240> might

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
not have those mouse buttons it might

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.940 
not have those mouse buttons it might
not<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.630> convenient<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
not be that convenient really the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.920 
not be that convenient really the
easiest<00:02:21.370> way<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:22.060> camera<00:02:22.390> controls<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
easiest way to do camera controls is to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.230 
easiest way to do camera controls is to
hold<00:02:23.140> down<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.320> spacebar<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.760> pops<00:02:25.060> up

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
hold down the spacebar and that pops up

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.900 
hold down the spacebar and that pops up
something<00:02:25.690> called<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.260> hot<00:02:26.470> box<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.790> hot

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
something called the hot box and the hot

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.610 
something called the hot box and the hot
box<00:02:28.180> has<00:02:28.450> these<00:02:28.660> buttons<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.470> do

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
box has these buttons that you can do

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.440 
box has these buttons that you can do
different<00:02:29.740> things<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:31.000> instance<00:02:31.240> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
different things with for instance this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.090 
different things with for instance this
button<00:02:31.840> when<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.620> I'm<00:02:32.740> holding<00:02:32.920> down

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
button when you so I'm holding down

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.860 
button when you so I'm holding down
spacebar<00:02:33.520> I'm<00:02:33.940> clicking<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:34.420> button<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
spacebar I'm clicking on this button and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.780 
spacebar I'm clicking on this button and
dragging<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.560> now<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:35.950> can<00:02:36.160> rotate<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.610> camera

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
dragging and now I can rotate the camera

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.120 
dragging and now I can rotate the camera
now<00:02:37.480> let<00:02:37.630> go<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.900> hotbox<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.620> disappears

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
now let go with the hotbox it disappears

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.220 
now let go with the hotbox it disappears
and<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.550> let<00:02:39.940> go<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.300> still<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.540> rotating

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
and I can let go and still be rotating

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.450 
and I can let go and still be rotating
so<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.130> can<00:02:42.340> pan<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.360> zoom<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.010> get<00:02:45.190> sort

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
so I can pan I can zoom if you get sort

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.430 
so I can pan I can zoom if you get sort
of<00:02:45.550> your<00:02:46.300> view<00:02:46.540> gets<00:02:46.780> broken<00:02:47.050> you'll<00:02:47.320> hold

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
of your view gets broken you'll hold

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.950 
of your view gets broken you'll hold
down<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> hotbox<00:02:48.420> spacebar<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.570> click<00:02:49.810> this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
down the hotbox spacebar and click this

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.290 
down the hotbox spacebar and click this
button<00:02:50.170> little<00:02:50.560> recenter<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> refocus<00:02:52.180> on

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
button little recenter and refocus on

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.240 
button little recenter and refocus on
the<00:02:52.420> object<00:02:52.890> there's<00:02:53.890> some<00:02:53.980> other<00:02:54.100> useful

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the object there's some other useful

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.280 
the object there's some other useful
things<00:02:54.490> in<00:02:54.580> here<00:02:54.790> if<00:02:55.210> you<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.810> know<00:02:55.930> if<00:02:55.960> you

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
things in here if you you know if you

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.710 
things in here if you you know if you
notice<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.160> can't<00:02:57.400> rotate<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:58.360> not<00:02:58.540> art

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
notice you can't rotate it's not art

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.630 
notice you can't rotate it's not art
ball<00:02:58.900> rotation<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.500> turntable<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.400> called

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
ball rotation it's turntable it's called

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.060 
ball rotation it's turntable it's called
so<00:03:01.330> there's<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:02.020> can't<00:03:02.230> sort<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.650> spin<00:03:02.950> this

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
so there's you can't sort of spin this

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.040 
so there's you can't sort of spin this
object<00:03:03.280> around<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:03.970> click<00:03:04.210> free<00:03:04.630> rotate

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
object around if you click free rotate

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.920 
object around if you click free rotate
then<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.510> more<00:03:07.780> traditional

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
then you can go to a more traditional

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.570 
then you can go to a more traditional
kind<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.620> rotation<00:03:09.070> where<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.520> all

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
kind of rotation where you can get all

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.710 
kind of rotation where you can get all
sorts<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.970> crazy<00:03:10.180> views<00:03:12.450> let's<00:03:13.450> turn<00:03:13.630> that

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
sorts of crazy views let's turn that

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.340 
sorts of crazy views let's turn that
back<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:14.080> though<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.760> also<00:03:15.760> if<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.990> want<00:03:17.230> to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
back off though and also if you want to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.950 
back off though and also if you want to
snap<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.190> fixed<00:03:18.550> camera<00:03:18.940> angles<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.780> can

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
snap to fixed camera angles you can

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.380 
snap to fixed camera angles you can
check<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.650> snap<00:03:20.940> option<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.090> now<00:03:22.150> you'll<00:03:22.330> see

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
check the snap option and now you'll see

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.460 
check the snap option and now you'll see
that<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.680> view<00:03:23.950> snaps<00:03:24.520> as<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:24.850> get<00:03:25.060> close<00:03:25.360> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that the view snaps as I get close to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.290 
that the view snaps as I get close to
sort<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.560> looking<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.610> side<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.120> is

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
sort of looking on the side so this is

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.040 
sort of looking on the side so this is
snapping<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.930> x<00:03:29.140> y&amp;z<00:03:29.770> axes<00:03:30.570> okay<00:03:31.570> so<00:03:34.050> now

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
snapping to the x y&amp;z axes okay so now

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.230 
snapping to the x y&amp;z axes okay so now
let's<00:03:35.860> assume<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.310> did<00:03:36.370> some<00:03:36.700> stuff<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.120> this

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
let's assume I did some stuff to this

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.970 
let's assume I did some stuff to this
model<00:03:37.780> like<00:03:37.900> I'm<00:03:38.050> going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> going<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.680> in

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
model like I'm going to going to in

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
model like I'm going to going to in
later<00:03:39.100> tutorials<00:03:41.100> now<00:03:42.100> we<00:03:42.160> want<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.880> know

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
later tutorials now we want to you know

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.630 
later tutorials now we want to you know
do<00:03:43.270> something<00:03:43.300> you<00:03:44.140> know<00:03:44.230> save<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.650> out<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:45.010> if

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
do something you know save it out so if

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.000 
do something you know save it out so if
two<00:03:45.790> options<00:03:46.120> one<00:03:46.240> you<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.540> save<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.770> if<00:03:47.890> you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
two options one you can save and if you

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.640 
two options one you can save and if you
go<00:03:48.160> save<00:03:48.520> then<00:03:49.300> you'll<00:03:50.080> get<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.350> option<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
go save then you'll get the option to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.070 
go save then you'll get the option to
save<00:03:50.890> as<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.100> dot<00:03:51.250> mix<00:03:51.520> file<00:03:51.850> that's<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.690> binary

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
save as a dot mix file that's a binary

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.930 
save as a dot mix file that's a binary
format<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.590> can<00:03:53.710> save<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.100> load<00:03:54.220> dot<00:03:54.520> mixes

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
format you can save and load dot mixes

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.840 
format you can save and load dot mixes
they're<00:03:55.720> more<00:03:55.960> compact<00:03:56.590> they<00:03:57.340> save<00:03:57.640> more

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
they're more compact they save more

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.480 
they're more compact they save more
information<00:03:58.390> than<00:03:58.570> just<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.930> mesh<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.400> if

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
information than just the mesh so if

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.130 
information than just the mesh so if
you're<00:04:00.640> working<00:04:00.910> strictly<00:04:01.420> inside<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> mesh

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
you're working strictly inside a mesh

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.980 
you're working strictly inside a mesh
mixer<00:04:02.320> you<00:04:02.710> need<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:03.220> should<00:04:03.250> use<00:04:03.520> dot<00:04:03.760> mix

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
mixer you need you should use dot mix

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.830 
mixer you need you should use dot mix
but<00:04:04.990> you<00:04:05.110> can<00:04:05.260> also<00:04:05.910> export<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.360> can<00:04:07.510> export

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
but you can also export you can export

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.830 
but you can also export you can export
as<00:04:07.990> different<00:04:08.350> formats<00:04:08.770> for<00:04:09.040> instance<00:04:09.840> let's

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
as different formats for instance let's

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.270 
as different formats for instance let's
resize<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.260> window<00:04:11.500> here<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.680> can<00:04:11.860> export<00:04:12.130> as

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
resize the window here you can export as

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.250 
resize the window here you can export as
obj<00:04:13.320> colada<00:04:14.320> PL<00:04:15.100> y<00:04:15.420> STL<00:04:16.420> ASCII<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.020> SDL<00:04:17.380> binary

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
obj colada PL y STL ASCII and SDL binary

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.020 
obj colada PL y STL ASCII and SDL binary
and<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.980> if<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> wanted<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.460> send<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.820> file<00:04:21.000> to

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
and so if you wanted to send a file to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.670 
and so if you wanted to send a file to
3d<00:04:21.540> printer<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.930> might<00:04:22.080> want<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.290> export<00:04:22.500> as

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
3d printer you might want to export as

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.940 
3d printer you might want to export as
STL<00:04:23.100> for<00:04:23.310> example<00:04:24.470> obj<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.650> sort<00:04:25.890> of

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
STL for example obj is a sort of

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.820 
STL for example obj is a sort of
universal<00:04:26.550> everyone<00:04:27.150> can<00:04:27.330> use<00:04:27.420> Dae<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.080> also

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
universal everyone can use Dae is also

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.710 
universal everyone can use Dae is also
some<00:04:29.040> printing<00:04:29.730> services<00:04:30.090> like<00:04:30.270> Shapeways

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
some printing services like Shapeways

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.110 
some printing services like Shapeways
take<00:04:31.050> those<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:33.260> that's<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.760> that's<00:04:35.880> our

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
take those and that's so that's our

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.630 
take those and that's so that's our
first<00:04:36.390> five<00:04:36.600> minutes<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.470> that's<00:04:37.830> basic<00:04:38.340> mesh

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
first five minutes so that's basic mesh

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.830 
first five minutes so that's basic mesh
