00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.069
 and hello everyone already knows 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.830
 what she leaves so I'm doing a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.800
 new video on hd assassin's 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 creed so in fact it's not the screed 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.500
 loose 2 0 doing in factories already 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.140
 all done so that's the age that I do not 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 I built in two three four 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.060
 hours 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.800
 so in fact here I am going to you the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.320
 present so that's actually I 'm going 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.109
 do a little trick then in fact if 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.099
 you want to make one 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.190
 I'll expect you to present 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.750
 show it like that if you want to do it 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.320
 so I'm going to advise you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 stuff 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.750
 so I'll tell you if you want 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 to make a nation creed in wooden paper 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 then you count then do take 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.790
 like that to warm the dimension to 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 dimension then 1,2 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.130
 these two enemies as you take a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.360
 stick not too small because if you 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.760
 do you take too small sailboats 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.680
 will do that if you take too big 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.770
 you will not have fun maneuverability 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 for loose so you take a boat 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 like that yes I think I do it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 as it goes so as soon as you have a 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.650
 boat like that although you see 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 that he is well manageable everything and that's 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.040
 you then after you of course you 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.020
 attack up then up 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.390
 it's more difficult for me 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.060
 it was more difficult in fact if you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.369
 go on the internet average winds on 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 know what I did I had trouble 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.690
 of me actually what I'm doing at 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 inside it's kind of nothing 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.040
 kind of circle to serks like that he 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.920
 sagged that's it and so in fact you 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.649
 try to redo the same production of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 figure you put is actually you 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 make the outline all around m the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.640
 contour does in turn and then you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.360
 return your coach is actually there 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 must the ax 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.709
 she finally looked at me I do not have 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.150
 right you know me I'm eating hot with some 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.709
 Scotch 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.540
 if you why it does it a 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.019
 thickness could therefore sit but 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.930
 of hell stx and cutting so in fact 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.840
 So after that I know them as 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.310
 it's like that all as soon as you 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.799
 all stuck after investigation the pic 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.660
 as you want so here is in fact 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.400
 it's done that after you've booked 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.920
 your h 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.430
 but if you have kind of material 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.520
 materials a little better kind the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.290
 glue the super glue machine taker 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.709
 will be much better I took some 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.510
 scotch I do not have I do not have a lot of 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.830
 materials that day so see me I 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.670
 more scot I did all the round for 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.470
 approach we go on if you have that in 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.390
 paper and then that you type on 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.870
 a few things quietly at all 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.140
 right away you do not need how more what 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.810
 so here yes yes me inside I did 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.340
 site rows camouflage a little after 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.560
 all I had a bit their gun all 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.769
 to do yes so I took a bit of 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.019
 wood 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.850
 normal this country was already a little 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.720
 will find then I will break on 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.260
 saw a little crack already has it 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.720
 you see blood hair for me 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.620
 do resume and omar kerman see tak 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.810
 tak up 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.370
 tell me I have already eaten good ripening 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.400
 if I put the elastics so for that 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.260
 how much did I want to be because 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.650
 than 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.930
 for me that's it it was a little 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 indian h 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.000
 so if you want to make an ax 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.129
 like that tells you you do not take 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.739
 neither too big nor too small you take 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.629
 normal it's not okay it depends on you and 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.170
 of your if you find that he is well 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.170
 handy 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.900
 that's who you start 7 the outline 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.480
 all outlines here after you you 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.790
 go back do the thicknesses of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.090
 as this and this but it may be 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.370
 like that they are there and then after my 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.709
 you end up then you use spam no 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.750
 you do any case ready to you have 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.410
 your h 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.440
 after if you put a little 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.570
 I like it if you like it and then I 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.750
 you will do other videos later on 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.750
