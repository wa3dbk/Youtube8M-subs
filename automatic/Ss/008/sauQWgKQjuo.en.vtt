know is actually made it work
I've<00:00:14.129> tried<00:00:14.459> it<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.820> I'm<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.270> to<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.480> try<00:00:15.779> for

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
I've tried it so I'm going to a try for

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.230 
I've tried it so I'm going to a try for
it<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.980> today<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:17.940> if<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.090> works

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
it you know today and see if it works

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.390 
it you know today and see if it works
obviously<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.930> see<00:00:19.140> there's<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.920> clear<00:00:20.100> some

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
red light comes up straight away so he

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.760 
red light comes up straight away so he

very nice pursue that box is pretty much
overheated<00:01:13.900> let's<00:01:14.710> just<00:01:14.890> turn<00:01:15.370> off<00:01:15.550> this<00:01:15.790> very

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
overheated let's just turn off this very

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.740 
overheated let's just turn off this very
second<00:01:16.480> so<00:01:16.660> partly<00:01:16.990> now<00:01:17.260> we<00:01:17.590> have<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
second so partly now we have to do this

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:57.560 
second so partly now we have to do this
is<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.080> reserved<00:01:24.930> strat<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.360> blocking

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.260 

only<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.780> should<00:01:59.050> work<00:01:59.260> but<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.250> don't<00:02:00.940> think

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
only this should work but I don't think

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.870 
only this should work but I don't think
you're<00:02:01.450> technically<00:02:01.780> will

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.350 

actually<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.780> does<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.469> see<00:02:08.360> then

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
actually it does as you can see then

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.699 
actually it does as you can see then
this<00:02:10.130> does<00:02:11.130> actually<00:02:11.340> work<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.959> playing<00:02:13.470> my

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
this does actually work but playing my

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.690 
this does actually work but playing my
xbox<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.390> roasting<00:02:15.390> my<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.550> I'm<00:02:17.550> in
