this video I'm just going to share a
couple<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.420> quick<00:00:33.480> tips<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:35.160> might<00:00:35.340> want

couple of quick tips that you might want

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.240 
couple of quick tips that you might want
to<00:00:36.090> consider<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> sunroof<00:00:38.100> that's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
to consider if you have a sunroof that's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.510 
to consider if you have a sunroof that's
not<00:00:38.520> working<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.320> 87<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.559> 93<00:00:40.920> models<00:00:41.430> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
not working on the 87 to 93 models this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.080 
not working on the 87 to 93 models this
is<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:42.110> 1992<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.530> ninety<00:00:43.800> two<00:00:44.040> point<00:00:44.219> six

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is a 1992 one ninety two point six

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750 
is a 1992 one ninety two point six
the<00:00:45.809> roofs<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.649> moving<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the roofs not moving and you can see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639 
the roofs not moving and you can see
right<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> back

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right here that it's down in the back

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.660 
right here that it's down in the back
which<00:00:50.370> means<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:51.239> probably<00:00:51.570> something

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
which means there's probably something

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
which means there's probably something
really<00:00:53.670> wrong<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.690> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
really wrong with it it's just not just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.350 
really wrong with it it's just not just
the<00:00:55.590> fact<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.250> moving<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.090> first

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the fact that it's not moving the first

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.060 
the fact that it's not moving the first
thing<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> course<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.590> check

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
thing you want to do of course is check

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.090 
thing you want to do of course is check
the<00:00:59.309> fuse<00:01:00.079> maybe<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.289> fuse<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> blown<00:01:01.800> we've

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the fuse maybe the fuse is blown we've

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
the fuse maybe the fuse is blown we've
checked<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> fuse<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> fuse<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> fine

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
checked the fuse here the fuse is fine

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.440 
checked the fuse here the fuse is fine
and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.610> beginning<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.299> your

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and so the beginning of your

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 
and so the beginning of your
troubleshooting<00:01:06.900> process<00:01:07.380> should<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
troubleshooting process should be to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.350 
troubleshooting process should be to
determine<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.530> motor<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.159> working<00:01:11.549> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
determine if the motor is working you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
determine if the motor is working you
won't<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> motor<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.740> working<00:01:14.220> at

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
won't you if the motor is not working at

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.030 
won't you if the motor is not working at
all<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.689> first<00:01:16.110> challenge<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.710> try<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
all then the first challenge is try to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
all then the first challenge is try to
get<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> motor<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> work<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.390> really

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
get the motor to work because you really

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.830 
get the motor to work because you really
need<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.320> able<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.939> open<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> sunroof<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
need to be able to open the sunroof you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
need to be able to open the sunroof you
got<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> able<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.280> open<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
got that you need to be able to open the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.450 
got that you need to be able to open the
sunroof<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.420> order<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> disconnect<00:01:25.619> things<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
sunroof in order to disconnect things to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
sunroof in order to disconnect things to
get<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.810> parts<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.229> might<00:01:28.470> need<00:01:28.740> repair

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
get to the parts that might need repair

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
get to the parts that might need repair
now<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> motor<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.390> access<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> trunk

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
now the motor can be access to the trunk

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
now the motor can be access to the trunk
let's<00:01:31.860> take<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> look<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
let's take a look now and see if that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
let's take a look now and see if that
motor<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> running<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.670> I've<00:01:35.670> removed

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
motor is running or not I've removed

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
transmission gear drive shaft we're
going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> rotates<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> does

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
going to see if that rotates if it does

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280 
going to see if that rotates if it does
not<00:01:56.579> rotate<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.600> means<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.020> gears

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
not rotate it probably means the gears

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.870 
not rotate it probably means the gears
are<00:01:58.530> stripped<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.950> even<00:01:59.340> though<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
are stripped out even though you can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
are stripped out even though you can
hear<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> motor<00:02:00.390> running<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.380> let's<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:01.799> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
hear the motor running so let's try that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.699 
hear the motor running so let's try that
now

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.869 

okay<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:11.090> can<00:02:11.300> see<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.720> turning<00:02:12.640> now<00:02:13.640> that

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
okay you can see it turning now that

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.699 
okay you can see it turning now that
doesn't<00:02:14.239> guarantee<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.840> everything<00:02:15.530> is

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
doesn't guarantee that everything is

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.339 
doesn't guarantee that everything is
good<00:02:15.980> inside<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:17.060> motor<00:02:17.510> assembly<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.230> at

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
good inside that motor assembly but at

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.500 
good inside that motor assembly but at
least<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.709> know<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.790> moving<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:20.480> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
least you know that's moving but I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.509 
least you know that's moving but I
noticed<00:02:20.959> something<00:02:21.019> else<00:02:21.470> real<00:02:21.860> strange<00:02:22.250> here

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
noticed something else real strange here

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.910 
noticed something else real strange here
when<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> pulled<00:02:22.970> off<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.450> inner<00:02:24.170> fender<00:02:24.560> panel

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
when I pulled off the inner fender panel

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.979 
when I pulled off the inner fender panel
there<00:02:25.580> supposed<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.030> be<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.209> tube<00:02:26.569> running

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
there supposed to be a tube running

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.050 
there supposed to be a tube running
right<00:02:27.260> down<00:02:27.470> here<00:02:27.709> where<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.069> cable<00:02:28.580> exits

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
right down here where the cable exits

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.410 
right down here where the cable exits
and<00:02:29.300> goes<00:02:30.140> back<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.500> forth<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.910> drive<00:02:32.209> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
and goes back and forth to drive the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.170 
and goes back and forth to drive the
sunroof<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.989> that's<00:02:33.110> missing<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.610> now<00:02:34.910> it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
sunroof and that's missing so now it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.850 
sunroof and that's missing so now it's
going<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> take<00:02:35.690> some<00:02:35.959> more<00:02:36.110> detective<00:02:36.680> work

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
going to take some more detective work

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.009 
going to take some more detective work
to<00:02:36.890> find<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.370> where<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> world<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.660> cable

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
to find out where in the world the cable

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.250 
to find out where in the world the cable
go<00:02:39.910> okay<00:02:40.910> what's<00:02:41.150> next<00:02:41.569> well<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> next

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
go okay what's next well the next

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.850 
go okay what's next well the next
challenge<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.640> see<00:02:44.090> what's<00:02:44.299> going<00:02:44.690> on<00:02:44.900> in

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
challenge is to see what's going on in

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.339 
challenge is to see what's going on in
here<00:02:46.370> underneath<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:47.120> sunroof<00:02:47.630> panel<00:02:48.049> this

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
here underneath this sunroof panel this

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.170 
here underneath this sunroof panel this
is<00:02:48.530> where<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.829> cable<00:02:49.280> comes<00:02:49.519> up<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.849> connects

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
is where the cable comes up and connects

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.809 
is where the cable comes up and connects
to<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.360> sunroof<00:02:50.840> right<00:02:51.049> back<00:02:51.260> here<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.640> guess

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
to the sunroof right back here but guess

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.370 
to the sunroof right back here but guess
what<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.650> can't<00:02:54.650> get<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.049> factory

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
what I can't get to that the the factory

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.500 
what I can't get to that the the factory
manual<00:02:57.739> says<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.160> order<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.489> remove<00:02:58.940> the

there's a procedure where you you know

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.949 
there's a procedure where you you know
unclip<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.459> pull<00:03:07.760> it<00:03:07.790> out<00:03:08.000> from

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
you get the panel out how am I going to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.379 
you get the panel out how am I going to
inspect<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.829> cable<00:03:16.040> or<00:03:16.370> even<00:03:16.639> know<00:03:17.180> what's

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
inspect the cable or even know what's

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.569 
inspect the cable or even know what's
going<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:17.780> there<00:03:18.200> let<00:03:18.829> alone<00:03:18.859> there's

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
going on there let alone there's

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.979 
going on there let alone there's
probably<00:03:19.940> something<00:03:20.389> wrong<00:03:20.569> with<00:03:20.810> these

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
probably something wrong with these

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.559 
probably something wrong with these

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
angular tilting arms and I'm sure the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.890 
angular tilting arms and I'm sure the
whole<00:03:23.690> system<00:03:24.200> needs<00:03:24.680> lubrication<00:03:24.889> because
