00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
morning when you woke up what was the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.069 
morning when you woke up what was the
most<00:01:30.570> vivid<00:01:31.079> memory<00:01:31.500> from<00:01:32.130> yesterday<00:01:33.079> for

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
most vivid memory from yesterday for

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.800 
most vivid memory from yesterday for
it's<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.740> tough<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.400> were<00:01:35.939> so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's a tough one because there were so

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's a tough one because there were so
many<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.229> probably<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.829> seeing<00:01:38.369> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
many but probably I think seeing that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
many but probably I think seeing that
image<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> big

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
image of when I want on the on the big

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670 
image of when I want on the on the big
screen<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> first<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:43.020> TV<00:01:43.320> last

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.310 
screen for the first time or on TV last
night<00:01:43.829> actually<00:01:44.130> almost<00:01:45.020> looking<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
night actually almost looking at it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.780 
night actually almost looking at it
rather<00:01:46.530> than<00:01:46.740> being<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.070> part<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.549> was

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
rather than being a part of it was

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
rather than being a part of it was
probably<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> first<00:01:49.409> things<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
probably one of the first things that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.120 
probably one of the first things that
popped<00:01:49.979> into<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.310> mind<00:01:50.720> what<00:01:51.720> now
