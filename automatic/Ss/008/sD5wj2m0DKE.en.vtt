00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:12.840
 of the year now we go to part 2 and the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.049
 The first game I'm going to talk about today is 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.890
 That beautiful girl from the games world. 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.060
 full of cool games like 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.359
 very accurate gameplay and graphics 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.219
 until now never seen and lots of fun 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.219
 in a half-open world 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.940
 taking you to look at that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.800
 protagonist for about 12 hours of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 campaign is not boring either, right? 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 It's very hot from the carton and the next one. 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050

 open world one of the first of the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 that for me would be the best game of the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 year 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 Unfortunately, I'm the one in the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.199
 things then sometimes it's not what I 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.460
 For me it's the best game of the year. 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.020
