00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.800

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.219
 infinite twilight by stephanie meyer 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 it was very very very important in a time 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.640
 of my life and what remains is still 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.690
 being from my favorite books and if I 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.710
 I liked it very much but good if I have to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.750

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.060
 I stay with twilight though here 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.049
 enter the 4 in the favorites I want 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.090
 say that I 'm not following any 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.950
 Order from best to worst others favorite 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.270
 less favorites just like I've 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.190
 I put them in the tower 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 between shades of gray of secret routes 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.570
 It was the first book I read from the author 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.100
 and I really did not expect what I 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.080
 I found in him it would be that he lives to find 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.780
 a very hard story to a character 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.210
 feminine and it surprised me so much 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.759
 the story like how it was written 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.770
 as route 6 as author and if you have not 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.170
 read I do not know if you recommend between tones 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.550
 of gray or the color of dreams your 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.020
 second novel that is also from my 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.539
 preferred but I will not teach it in 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.610
 this video that if you have not tried a 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.649
 route novel you ask I do not know what 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.840
 you are waiting there is someone out there 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.310
 of bad in kiss is the fourth part of 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.869
 the sisters world and whenever I speak 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.490
 of this saga or of this book in 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.899
 I always say that it is the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.820
 first I read I did not know it was a 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.440
 saga and I learned perfectly about the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.539
 story of the characters only that is 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.890
 better read them in order because between one 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.240
 and another one is passing the time and in the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.800
 first of all for example best and 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.509
 awards that is the protagonist of this 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.069
 much younger book and you're going 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.690
 watching you evolve until you get to your 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.080
 novel each novel is from a sister and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.480
 is 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.810
 walsh with her gay husband they give in new 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.450
 york a very very very sad story very 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.940
 pretty real very funny very 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.940
 Wonderful wonderful I do not know what you decide 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.170
 the circle of fire by marion corley 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.360
 whenever I talk about this author I say what 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.580
 same what for you is jk rowling 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.440
 for me it's marian corley I love 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.150
 so much this book that is autoconclusivo 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.379
 as the saga of the guardians of the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.269
 time have always been of my 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.950
 preferred I spent hours and hours and 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.530
 rereading this particular book 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.420
 because it started and ended and I flirt with 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.140
 very much tells us the story of Kate 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.450
 a girl who has powers and jarrod a 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.849
 his school friend who looks at her 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.940
 as if it were weird because it is 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.560
 but they discover that jug also hides 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.349
 something special that not even himself 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.060
 you know and you have to travel to the past to 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.220
 meet the ancestors of jarrod and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.140
 change something that has to do with a 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.450
 curse or something like that because really not 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.010
 I remember this book very well, I only know that 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.380
 I love come on I'll have it reale was 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.140
 one day 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.420
 where the monsters of maurice sendak or 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.130
 sendak or as it is said also I have 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.640
 talked a lot about reading my book 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.410
 childhood 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.570
 I read it without stopping without stopping without stopping 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.400
 Then I spent a few years 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.260
 very much about him because he was like I am 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.420
 older and I can read things about children 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 reading it now with 23 years I can 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.620
 ensure that it's still wonderful it 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.570
 read in 5 minutes is a story and the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.220
 need is the story has nothing 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.110
 special but all that is behind 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.460
 the story for me is so special that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.070
 it has to be one of my favorites 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.740
 always when the trees speak or 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.570
 speak of the shore or sanderson really 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.790
 I do not know what to say about this book is a 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.220
 very very hard story explained from a 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.750
 simple way if you want him brother like that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.160
 are these editions of which are read 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.350
 in the institute and can pass 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.880
 unnoticed as one more book of these 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.860
 that make you read in the institute of 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.080
 girls with problems of these things is 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.120
 much more the story of melinda like 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 the hardness of the words is explained 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.350
 and all the truths he says is 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.000
 amazing and I think that even if you have not 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.070
 gone through nothing like it although you do not 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.960
 you have felt as bad as melinda 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.980
 you get to connect in such a way with her 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.780
 I do not know 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.699
 a book I will not say nice because I do not 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.440
 celebrated nice is a very hard book but 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.360
 it's wonderful and without everything in the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.729
 Youth literature is the best that I have 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.560
 read you will not be gossip 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.790
 ambrosetti I read it this year for the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.590
 university and it has simply been 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.510
 become my favorite classic or the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.680
 narrative structure that has both 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.220
 narrators that newspaper put on the letter 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.010
 very cool there is a drama 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.660
 and you have to give credit soon 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.490
 he deserves that his two sisters were 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.350
 great and wonderful too but 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.630
 traveling and he also wrote very well and 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.910
 this novel is proof of that 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.230
 I chatted the chocolate factory I'm not going to 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.760
 say nothing more about this book 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.020
 Roldan stole my heart where I had 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.690
 eight years and still will not have returned 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.210
 something for elephants' of sara gruen is 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.040
 wonderful is such a cool book is so 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.350
 I have no words 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.140
 the characters ni jay with marlene to 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.840
 rossi rossi is an elephant and is a 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.880
 great character and it's the beginning of the 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.350
 novel that deceives you during all the 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.600
 story and you get to the end and you say 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.550
 because I have not noticed and that it's worth 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.130
 a lot of really worth it is called 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.200
 for elephants look at the ladies bar 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.870
 locks is a book written in 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.640
 Catalan but you have it in Spanish 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.160
 flame broken mirror I will leave you here the 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.419
 cover of the translation into Spanish and 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.310
 please have to read marx 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.730
 Latches writes these 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.200
 characters that narration is wonderful 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.940
 really me when I discovered it in the 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.590
 institute was like I have not read 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.790
 before this woman and it's over now I'm 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.020
 thinking because I have not read anything else 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.270
 yours in just read 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.919
 and we're going to criticize a few 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.639
 words of sanz del barça so that no 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.639
 I felt it without him 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.819
 default in our stores 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.520
 al in rampart and funk both rowing 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.409
 rowell I think both are my 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.639
 preferred by the author herself is like 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.009
 write in goal or flight 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.990
 she is wonderful as a writer and 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.729
 like everything and although he in a shelter was 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.349
 a little more special in the sense of 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.509
 that I felt a lot more identified 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.520
 with the minor that with here with fang he 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.080
 I had a great time and I was surprised 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.449
 very much everything I had hidden 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.620
 behind the story at the beginning 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.300
 when you read it it seems that it has not been 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.409
 as much as ellen or lampard but at 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.050
 better what happens is that in the book 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.330
 much is more palpable all that 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.219
 happens and muddy is a bit more 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.080
 hidden but both are worth a lot 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.389
 pity and that if I have not read rimbaud robbery 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.889
 doing this is ugly but if you can 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.050
 do it in English do it in English 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.669
 because he and my favorite traits of 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.190
 him in oran park in spanish and although you 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.259
 count the same we will give you rowell in 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.770
 English and you can I just say it and what 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.569
 I leave there now and you do what 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.460
 you wish I were here from
