00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
right here without the top string so

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.280 
right here without the top string so
it's<00:00:52.150> like<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.390> bottom<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:52.809> G<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.960> pinky

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
it's like the bottom of the G your pinky

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.500 
it's like the bottom of the G your pinky
right<00:00:56.379> there<00:00:56.650> but<00:00:56.860> out<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.190> top<00:00:57.400> string<00:00:57.670> so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
right there but out the top string so

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.100 
right there but out the top string so
how<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:58.780> do<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.080> like<00:00:59.199> this<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:01.839> hit<00:01:01.960> the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
how you do is you like this to hit the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.500 
how you do is you like this to hit the
top<00:01:02.290> string<00:01:02.589> 0<00:01:03.839> then<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.960> hit<00:01:05.080> four<00:01:06.210> zero<00:01:07.210> four

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
top string 0 then you hit four zero four

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:17.010 
top string 0 then you hit four zero four
zero<00:01:08.409> zero<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.810> B<00:01:13.960> string<00:01:14.070> three<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:16.390> says

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
zero zero on the B string three one says

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:27.600 
zero zero on the B string three one says
enter<00:01:17.229> F<00:01:21.780> zero<00:01:22.780> four<00:01:23.530> zero<00:01:23.950> four<00:01:24.909> zero<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
enter F zero four zero four zero and

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.060 
enter F zero four zero four zero and
then<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.850> B<00:01:28.000> string<00:01:28.360> zero<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.890> make

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
then the B string zero three one so make

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.679 
then the B string zero three one so make
sure<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.310> first<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.880> it's<00:01:34.270> gone<00:01:34.420> between<00:01:34.570> E

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
sure the first just it's gone between E

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.200 
sure the first just it's gone between E
and<00:01:34.840> D<00:01:35.110> sharp

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.109 

nigga<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.360> minor

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:02:02.450 

today<00:01:48.119> minor<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:50.450> 0<00:01:51.450> 4<00:01:51.869> 0<00:01:51.899> 0<00:01:55.759> 3<00:01:56.759> 1<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:58.369> minor

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.350 

II

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.010 

then<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.050> go<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.230> this<00:02:07.940> B<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.050> B<00:02:10.080> string

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
then you go like this B so the B string

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.670 
then you go like this B so the B string
0<00:02:13.020> 1<00:02:15.710> C<00:02:16.710> major

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
0 1 C major

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:33.809 
0 1 C major
and<00:02:19.579> you<00:02:19.730> go<00:02:19.879> 1<00:02:20.560> 0<00:02:21.560> 3<00:02:24.670> 0<00:02:25.670> 3<00:02:26.030> 1<00:02:26.840> 3<00:02:28.569> 1<00:02:29.569> e<00:02:30.530> major

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:44.349 

then<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.969> go<00:02:40.780> use<00:02:41.780> then<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.379> loop<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:44.269> let

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
then you go use then you loop it so let

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.429 
then you go use then you loop it so let
me<00:02:44.420> go<00:02:44.569> back<00:02:44.749> to<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.139> part<00:02:47.079> so<00:02:48.079> starting<00:02:48.379> with

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
me go back to this part so starting with

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.039 
me go back to this part so starting with
the<00:02:48.560> C<00:02:48.739> major<00:02:50.530> our<00:02:51.530> form<00:02:51.920> right<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.400> 0

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
the C major our form right here so 0

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.170 
the C major our form right here so 0
leaving<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.469> beginning<00:02:55.129> part<00:02:55.519> uses<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
leaving so the beginning part uses a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.229 
leaving so the beginning part uses a
minor<00:02:56.450> e<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.739> next<00:02:57.769> part<00:02:58.189> leads<00:02:58.609> into<00:02:58.790> C<00:02:59.060> major

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
minor e the next part leads into C major

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:07.500 
minor e the next part leads into C major
so<00:02:59.689> 0<00:03:00.219> 1<00:03:01.749> 3<00:03:03.370> C<00:03:04.370> major

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.319 

1:03<00:03:10.000> industry<00:03:11.000> code<00:03:12.730> zero<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.150> top

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
1:03 industry code zero on the top

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:32.770 
1:03 industry code zero on the top
string<00:03:15.430> 3-1<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.700> need<00:03:19.909> 3<00:03:20.870> 1<00:03:21.739> e<00:03:22.400> major

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.150 

so<00:03:33.780> I'll<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:33.989> play<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.290> now<00:03:34.440> it's<00:03:34.709> sort<00:03:35.099> of

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
so I'll just play it now it's sort of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:04:35.480 
so I'll just play it now it's sort of
slow

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.370 

it's<00:04:36.000> kind<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.360> cool<00:04:36.540> way<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:37.020> easy<00:04:37.229> to

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
it's kind of a cool way it's easy to

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.020 
it's kind of a cool way it's easy to
remember<00:04:37.620> too<00:04:38.010> because<00:04:38.550> basically<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:38.970> just

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
remember too because basically you just

00:04:39.030 --> 00:05:04.900 
remember too because basically you just
think<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.540> minor<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:45.620> minor<00:04:49.639> C<00:04:51.020> G<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.830> minor<00:04:59.090> a

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:22.550 

minor<00:05:20.389> so<00:05:21.389> you<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.780> make<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.020> kind<00:05:22.139> of<00:05:22.320> sound

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
minor so you can make it kind of sound

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:46.039 
minor so you can make it kind of sound
like<00:05:22.620> more<00:05:22.889> gypsy<00:05:23.310> style

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:46.049 

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:48.239 

you<00:05:47.049> can<00:05:47.139> mess<00:05:47.289> around<00:05:47.409> with<00:05:47.709> it<00:05:47.829> because<00:05:48.039> it's

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 
you can mess around with it because it's

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.789 
you can mess around with it because it's
so<00:05:48.399> easy<00:05:48.899> so<00:05:49.899> if<00:05:49.989> there<00:05:50.109> has<00:05:50.259> any<00:05:50.379> questions
