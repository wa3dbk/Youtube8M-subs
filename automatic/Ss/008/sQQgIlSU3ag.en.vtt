00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
sure that's going to give it a nice

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.710 
sure that's going to give it a nice
support<00:00:57.860> so<00:00:58.860> I<00:00:59.280> don't<00:01:00.210> think<00:01:00.420> we're<00:01:00.600> gonna

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
support so I don't think we're gonna

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.080 
support so I don't think we're gonna
have<00:01:00.870> any<00:01:00.930> problem<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.410> no<00:01:01.879> valcon<00:01:02.879> place
