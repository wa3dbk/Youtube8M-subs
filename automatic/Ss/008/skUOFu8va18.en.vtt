00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
so have a look at that this is a very

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.330 
so have a look at that this is a very

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
aggressive bet and it's gonna hit mess

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.849 
aggressive bet and it's gonna hit mess
up<00:03:45.549> mess<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.329> sixes<00:03:46.750> if<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.410> don't<00:03:47.620> know<00:03:47.739> the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
up mess of sixes if you don't know the

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.560 
up mess of sixes if you don't know the
theory<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.340> your<00:03:48.400> have<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.700> twenty20<00:03:49.239> bets

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
theory of your have the twenty20 bets

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.050 
theory of your have the twenty20 bets
it's<00:03:50.350> basically<00:03:50.859> you've<00:03:50.980> got<00:03:51.010> your<00:03:51.370> center<00:03:52.030> of

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
it's basically you've got your center of

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.000 
it's basically you've got your center of
gravity<00:03:52.150> lowered<00:03:52.870> down<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:53.560> your<00:03:53.709> swing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
gravity lowered down so your swing

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.370 
gravity lowered down so your swing
weight<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:55.359> get<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.540> lot<00:03:55.720> more<00:03:55.750> swing<00:03:56.170> weight

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
weight and get a lot more swing weight

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.819 
weight and get a lot more swing weight
and<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:57.400> know<00:03:57.519> your<00:03:57.780> power<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:59.019> ball<00:03:59.230> transfer

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
and you know your power to ball transfer

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.380 
and you know your power to ball transfer
is<00:04:00.010> just<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.280> lot<00:04:00.430> bigger<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:01.090> hit<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
is just a lot bigger and you can hit the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.960 
is just a lot bigger and you can hit the
