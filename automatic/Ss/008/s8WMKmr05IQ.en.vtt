00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi, in this tutorial I will show you how to create a new animation for Metin2 

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:12.001
 We will use a preview program for models and animations, and 3D Max version 7 

00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:26.002
 I've already unpacked * The * PC file and placed it on the D drive to see the textures for the model. 

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:37.003
 Let's move to the model, for example, Warrior I, open it by dragging the file to the interface of the program used to preview the models. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 As we can see, this is the Warrior's model, now let's find an animation. I've already chosen animation, 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:59.001
 which is played during character selection. "We do" just dragging animations onto the interface. 

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:05.002
 Click on the "Animation List" tab and select the animation. 

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.023
 And our model will start to move. 

00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:17.014
 Let's now move to 3D max when we have the selected animation. 

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:28.015
 Click "File" -&gt; "Import" and * search * any model of our warrior, for example this one. 

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:34.016
 We also mark here the option "NWN2 MDB Importer" 

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:39.017
 We will simply use these "plugins" 

00:01:39.018 --> 00:01:46.018
 If you took "IT" we will not see files with the extension .gr2 

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:55.149
 We choose the model. And we saw the bones of the model that we will animate the entire model. 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:13.150
 The bones are incorrectly set, so let's click the PPM on the sliding tool and in the Z vertical axis, move our bones up to 100 

00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:23.151
 Let's turn 90 °, turn on the snapshot * to rotate * for full values. 

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:31.152
 ie by 5, click the rotation and * turn * 90 ° 

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:46.503
 Now we can start the animation of our skeleton (bone, model). I will not * speak *, I'm not an expert 

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:51.504
 So only this simple animation will do. 

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:55.505
 First frame 

00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:59.505
 Now the last, somehow yes :). 

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:08.506
 We will move it sideways, maybe I will make a slope 

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:12.506
 Noooo something like this ...:&gt; 24 00: 03: 19,537 -&gt; 00: 03: 18,507 Still straighten ... 

00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:23.508
 Ok, we click Play 

00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:27.508
 We'll see how our animation will look like. 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.509
 Okay, our model is moving by hand. 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.510
 We now click "File" -&gt; "Export". Choose where * to save * our animation. 

00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:39.511
 Save 

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:51.512
 He asks if we want to replace, Yes. 

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:58.512
 And we deselect Export Textures, Model etc ... 

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:07.513
 We simply leave the animation itself with the "this" option selected. 

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.514
 We click "Export" 

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.515
 "Close" 

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:13.516
 Zminimalizujmy. 

00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:21.516
 Now we copy the exported * animation * and paste it into the converter. 

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:29.516
 Drag to it, click any key 

00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:36.517
 And we have created a converted animation that the client reads 

00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:43.518
 * Nonsensical pie **** ces * 

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.519
 Cutting!! : D 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:08.520
 * I do not know what I said: P something happened * 

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:14.522
 Click "Start Game!", Do not know how you are there. 

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.523
 And as we can see, our character moves with his hand. 

00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:25.524
 Thank you and good night because it's already 21:00: P.
