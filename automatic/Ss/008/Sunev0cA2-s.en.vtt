00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 with this we choose the fat and then with 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.250
 the fine with a manual sandpaper 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.680
 it has a bit of brightness that brightness and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.570
 limit only that it has features 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.570
 because if he does not achieve painting he does not eat 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.020
 the strips can have hits we're going to 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.020
 make a few hits 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.860
 sister 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.750
 with a barbed brush whether it's this 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.850
 west west or if not with a piece of 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.910
 wood and they claim several barbs that 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.150
 we're also going to start making you some 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.150
 scratches 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.410
 3 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.370
 inclined to see if the camera looks better 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.340
 that we 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.789
 go 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.789
 on this side of this start 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.270
 we already spent a little bit the old one already 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.640
 sandpaper 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 of the lands 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.160
 as we said last week 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.960
 we have linked all this we see with a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.080
 I spike with the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.800
 with the daughters lime 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.170
 they already have a base of plastic paint and 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.020
 it has remained the most rasposo 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.750
 paint has already hardened 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.130
 let's scratch a little before 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.130
 get him to apply the culture 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.540
 to throw 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.849
 the black lands you have to put a 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.849
 little brown too 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.400
 and good and soulful 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 what is red 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.690
 and I think you have to put too much 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.130
 2 try drugs 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.319
 i 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 Y 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.449
 and now a brush with water 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.310
 you can apply 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.790
 how 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.770
 a technique a little heavy but good 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.270
 the ideal is to have that I do not have it now 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:30.760
 there are some brushes that have the 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:34.680
 so long bristles then do so 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.680
 the folders are left 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.030
 and a lot 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.030
 as we have previously scratched 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.289
 and 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.050
 Y 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.050
 an African panel appears 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.910
 yes 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.860
 the four colors 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.230
 depending if we load more than one 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.280
 other color will come out more reddish black 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.280
 more brown 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:38.800
 now we are going to apply the before for 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.800
 that is fixed and does not fall then 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.650
 You fill with water a part of the 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.500
 water exterior 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.420
 latex is like varnish 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.930
 is the equivalent to barry in shape for 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.440
 these whites but when dry is 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.440
 transparent 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:04.090
 and it 's more than gun and tomato engineers 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:06.980
 to the child and put it with the roller and that 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.100
 put it with the diet 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.420
 It is convenient to do it with a brush to be 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.420
 long as said but 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.030
 and to apply in latex nobody to leave it 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.440
 let it dry and when I know it is now 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.440
 with brightness but when it goes 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.770
 usually 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.650
 here is not appreciated much but the 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.669
 brush her hair and often fall 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.669
 then they stay stuck 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.430
 if you can
