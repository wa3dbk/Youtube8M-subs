00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all you guys re 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome back the brand new video of the septum 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.120
 race on the nurburgring track gp 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.650
 throat mclaren f1 gtr of 300 gearbox e 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 pedals you can't see 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.060
 thrustmaster then as already announced 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.050
 that I show you the new cars of 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.449
 course reorganization to this is one of the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.580
 new and has been released wants dlc 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 trimbach anyway I'm sure 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.599
 you already know everyone, maybe not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 by name however it is a legendary car 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.000
 so I'm sure on the internet in 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.530
 photograph something but you've already seen it 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.880
 then as always beautiful turns there 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.070
 let's enjoy how we see a little bit 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 the car behaves and I decided to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.730
 leave the indicator permanently 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.980
 of pedals to give Russian waxing 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 clutch brake because maybe it can be 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 not of votes which however interesting for 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 someone see when and how much you are 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.039
 accelerating braking and seeing when 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.289
 gear change right for fun 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.289
 without friction then let's start 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.190
 perfect first round finished sorry if 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.170
 he did n't pay but I wanted to go for a ride 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.000
 decent in Sumerian and then now go a 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.510
 a little slower and talking about the album is ok 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.370
 then I don't know if I did it right 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.170
 almost all changed uphill without 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.990
 I do not know without using the clutch 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.670
 maybe you noticed something different 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.260
 compared for example with the last f40 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.580
 video made on how to change not 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.430
 on how he put it up to show 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.610
 change them without friction now 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.100
 in the morning 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.960
 bettin and i show you what that 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.660
 what I mean then first 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.640
 let's talk a bit about their car anyway 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.180
 spectacular as you can excellent 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.819
 estate 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.750
 street tends to drift a little though 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.060
 I'm the one who believes the taps 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.760
 on the accelerator when cornering to do it 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.989
 of the valley a little then look how much 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.879
 you have to change quickly because if 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.959
 change more slowly now I have to brake 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.760
 a moment otherwise we go to 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.799
 artichokes if you change more slowly 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.689
 such as the f40 where you need to 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.159
 go of course you have to go through 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.689
 crazy 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.510
 you have to wait a little while you need to 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.219
 lower the engine speed more 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.849
 instead look if I wait if I do 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.849
 like the f40 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.170
 you see it hurts the exchange nothing was 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.600
 just so still a curiosity not 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.690
 there is one interesting thing though this 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.150
 so a little a little curiosity and 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.280
 nothing we talk about again has found so 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.700
 I stop and also show up too 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.700
 the car 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.060
 the sound obviously exceptional 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.060
 genta 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.259
 now of course we give in and reggio 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.060
 ok it's the guys sound again 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.970
 spectacular interior but warmth 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.970
 the framing 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.780
 guys that say a show one 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.419
 incredible show 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.280
 so I hope guys that the video will 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.590
 you liked I hope the car pd like it 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.210
 I hope nothing these have changed 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.080
 practically except in climbing because i 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.939
 boys climbing 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.310
 I said it already in the previous video not 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.020
 it is just like the reality here is the 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.199
 mechanism is the same for the different 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.030
 the feeling under the hand so nothing 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.629
 then maybe he'll make us a video 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.190
 here is nothing if he had more sto 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.770
 almost all changed however in 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.169
 climb here were all questions 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:37.120
 without friction and nothing we liked 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.129
 next video or tangling e 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.370
 as for the initial emotion before 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:44.370
 a car like that goes down is buy back man
