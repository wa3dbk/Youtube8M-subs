00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.390
 welcome to the new kervezee types that 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
 does i have my life 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.320
 Dutch people like to go on holiday 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 then would like to be comfortable 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
 compact caravan that is this sprite 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 cruzer 460 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.260
 sr look the front 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.750
 typical characteristic of those in our knowledge 3 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 nice for windows and 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.500
 in the latest models combined with 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 a sky you so optimal light 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.580
 in your beautiful caravan 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 Another important point is the beautiful 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 smooth plate 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.860
 Englishmen are there artist see here 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.840
 the production method in which they vacuum 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.829
 concerns during the production process and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 have thereby 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 very tight processing of the side walls 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.410
 much nicer than many other producers 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 I would take a compact look at the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 total length 6 meters 6 long and then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.390
 you get for that if you just come to the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.629
 inside a very comfortable 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 normal caravan look at it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 beautiful couches that are here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.910
 that can be used as two single 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.070
 beds you can of course also a lot 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.470
 make work important feature of one 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.659
 our caravan is the innerspring 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.479
 I'm sitting on it now and I feel it 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.770
 it is extremely comfortable 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 you can do it from the movie of me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 but it is better to be in ours 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.990
 showroom to come check it out 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.360
 really is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.790
 this is also nice to see as working 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 with more efficient space in that means 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.330
 when you are on vacation with two people 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.130
 has a sufficient gas table here 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.689
 space and therefore a lot remains 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.040
 free space available 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.740
 of course there is included on it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 larger table that may be on between 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
 some beds can be put another 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.650
 feature of that as a caravan is the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 luxury kitchen vending machines 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.509
 maarten tromp oven grill 4-burner gas 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 there are actually 3 gas rings and one 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.189
 electric neighborhood so you always 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.869
 are independent during travels throughout 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.130
 europe through 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.630
 another important point if you would 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.950

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.120
 plenty of hot water for the shower and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.060
 roast I see point is of course the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.010
 beautiful atmosphere in this English caravan 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.190

 of this top caravan from england 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.440
 important is to say that 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.700
 english the caravans of course often with 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.080

 other competing English brands 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 the door is therefore not on the
