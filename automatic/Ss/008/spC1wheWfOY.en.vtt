00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
only decision that could make but was

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.090 
only decision that could make but was
put<00:00:50.090> in<00:00:50.210> my<00:00:50.300> body<00:00:50.450> did<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.350> taste<00:00:51.559> good<00:00:51.829> you

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
put in my body did it taste good you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.799 
put in my body did it taste good you
know<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.420> I<00:00:53.809> really<00:00:54.530> must<00:00:54.559> tell<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.100> that

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
know but I really must tell you that

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.440 
know but I really must tell you that
this<00:00:56.809> green<00:00:57.110> drink<00:00:57.500> right<00:00:57.739> here<00:00:58.090> that<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.239> just

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
this green drink right here that we just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.650 
this green drink right here that we just
got<00:00:59.629> from<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.840> blossoming<00:01:00.530> Lotus<00:01:01.480> here<00:01:02.480> in

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
got from the blossoming Lotus here in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.859 
got from the blossoming Lotus here in
Portland<00:01:03.699> just<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.759> little<00:01:04.879> green<00:01:05.210> drink<00:01:05.630> right

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
Portland just a little green drink right

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.680 
Portland just a little green drink right
here<00:01:06.399> probably<00:01:07.399> it's<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.670> little<00:01:07.910> diluted<00:01:08.509> down

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
here probably it's a little diluted down

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.930 
here probably it's a little diluted down
but<00:01:09.110> I<00:01:09.440> don't<00:01:10.340> know<00:01:10.399> if<00:01:10.490> you're<00:01:10.610> aware<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.820> this

but I don't know if you're aware of this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.109 
but I don't know if you're aware of this
enough<00:01:11.360> but<00:01:11.390> there<00:01:11.750> is<00:01:11.899> as<00:01:12.680> much<00:01:13.119> digestible
