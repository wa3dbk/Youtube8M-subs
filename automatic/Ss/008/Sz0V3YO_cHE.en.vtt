00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.569
 year of ordeals and historical 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.370
 accomplishments calls the outgoing 2014 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.650
 head of the occupying parliament of Crimea 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.570
 Vladimir Constantine this year he 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.219
 congratulates Crimeans from Moscow on 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.589
 press conference annexation of the peninsula 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.040
 he predictably calls the chief 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.640
 the achievement of the year of course we lived for 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.410
 this short period is probably a lifetime 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.010
 one era for our republic 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.560
 ended the era of 23 years in 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.990
 part of the state of Ukraine 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.300
 and now nine months past nine 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.550
 months we are in the composition 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.530
 Russian Federation so-called 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.630
 transitional period that gave birth to Crimeans 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.820
 a whole range of problems of the Constantines 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.680
 calls unique and also serves as 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.590
 merit of the occupying power 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
 summing it up of course now resin 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.280
 common human format can be said 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.770
 that we don't go or quick idiot and 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 just run really on this one 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.960
 ration and forward as a contour forward 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.270
 seemed to many you absolutely 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.519
 unique thing no one in the world like this 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.859
 did almost identical words about 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.020
 the main events of the year in the Crimea repeat 

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.359
 after Konstantinov and Crimeans on 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.840
 the streets of simferopol in your opinion 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.729
 It was the best in the Crimea this year 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.890
 quiet life without war without anything 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.400
 Crimea joining Russia by the most 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.220
 Good is what we went to Russia 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.210
 pension increased 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:34.960
 Here it became much better to live a referendum 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.500
 not necessary but I still do not know everything is good 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.610
 grapes mind not around the house good horror 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.229
 raspberry strawberry son came before the principle 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.920
 everything is fine ok I don't know from people 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.440
 after a festive mood but you are not 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.390
 shoot even speaking of cons of the past 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.640
 year Crimeans do not mention is not a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.770
 endless lines at the authorities and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.930
 the banks did not take off on the peninsula 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.820
 prices are not even about turning off the light 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.740
 who recently added 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.780
 inconvenience as if the residents did not notice 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 peninsulas and tens of thousands of Crimean 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.060
 families of torn annexations in negative 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.489
 no one felt the worst this 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.709
 that people suffer war goes shoot 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.720
 kill people die but nothing bad 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.120
 did not happen as i usually say here 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.190
 the main thing is not hurt everything else we 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.959
 translate in a fight with the rest 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.820
 the occupying authorities in the New Year 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.640

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.290

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.079
