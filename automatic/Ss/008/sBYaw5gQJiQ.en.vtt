anything<00:02:06.000> wrong<00:02:09.080> we<00:02:10.080> very<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.739> see

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
anything wrong we very much like to see

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.550 
anything wrong we very much like to see
in<00:02:11.190> our<00:02:11.340> girls<00:02:11.610> individual<00:02:12.300> personality<00:02:13.020> we

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
in our girls individual personality we

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050 
in our girls individual personality we
don't<00:02:13.739> want<00:02:13.980> them<00:02:14.069> all<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> end<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.030> same

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
don't want them all to end up the same

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.330 
don't want them all to end up the same
and<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:16.110> think<00:02:16.319> them<00:02:16.470> having<00:02:16.500> their<00:02:17.310> own

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and I think them having their own

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
and I think them having their own
confidence<00:02:18.060> means<00:02:18.360> they<00:02:18.630> should<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
confidence means they should have the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.500 
confidence means they should have the
confidence<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.950> themselves<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.360> know

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
confidence to be themselves and to know

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.570 
confidence to be themselves and to know
who<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.350> don't<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.040> believed<00:02:23.400> in

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
who they are I don't think I believed in

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220 
who they are I don't think I believed in
myself<00:02:23.610> before<00:02:24.060> as<00:02:24.330> much<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:24.630> i<00:02:24.690> did<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.050> my
