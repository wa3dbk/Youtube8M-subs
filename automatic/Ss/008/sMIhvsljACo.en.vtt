38 tons engine which is the 330 liter

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.999 
38 tons engine which is the 330 liter
engine<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.990> we<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.140> start<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.650> every<00:01:16.860> day

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
engine and we will start it every day

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.020 
engine and we will start it every day
which<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.380> quite<00:01:19.380> noisy<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
which going to be quite noisy but this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
which going to be quite noisy but this
is<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.409> removal

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
is what you can see in right removal

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.039

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
inside which is of course different from

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.850 
inside which is of course different from
the<00:06:06.340> cars<00:06:06.640> in<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:06.970> same<00:06:07.180> time<00:06:07.470> in<00:06:08.470> those<00:06:08.620> days

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
the cars in the same time in those days

to do to yourself

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.640 
to do to yourself
and<00:06:15.919> this<00:06:16.580> car<00:06:17.110> it's<00:06:18.110> known<00:06:18.470> to<00:06:18.860> be

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
and this car it's known to be

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.030 
and this car it's known to be
first<00:06:20.009> models<00:06:20.600> which<00:06:21.600> has<00:06:21.949> transmission<00:06:22.949> of

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
first models which has transmission of

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.310 
first models which has transmission of
the<00:06:23.070> power<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:23.729> it's<00:06:23.910> not<00:06:24.120> with<00:06:24.389> a<00:06:24.419> chain<00:06:24.780> ok

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
the power so it's not with a chain ok

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.520 
the power so it's not with a chain ok
but<00:06:25.889> it's<00:06:26.100> already<00:06:26.729> with<00:06:29.330> universal<00:06:30.330> a

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
but it's already with universal a

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.680 
but it's already with universal a
differential<00:06:31.530> exactly<00:06:32.400> exactly<00:06:32.759> how<00:06:33.630> many

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
differential exactly exactly how many

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.170 
differential exactly exactly how many
speeds<00:06:34.139> I<00:06:35.130> think<00:06:35.820> it<00:06:36.000> runs<00:06:36.570> up<00:06:36.870> till<00:06:37.110> 35

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
speeds I think it runs up till 35

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.469 
speeds I think it runs up till 35
kilometers<00:06:39.180> not<00:06:39.389> one<00:06:39.660> gear<00:06:39.960> one

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
kilometers not one gear one

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.070 
kilometers not one gear one
cost<00:06:43.479> the<00:06:43.899> cost<00:06:44.139> when<00:06:44.589> it<00:06:44.769> was<00:06:44.949> built<00:06:45.179> was<00:06:46.179> 160

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
cost the cost when it was built was 160

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.129 
cost the cost when it was built was 160
pounds<00:06:47.499> so<00:06:47.789> aromatic<00:06:48.789> that's<00:06:49.569> a<00:06:49.689> lot<00:06:49.839> of<00:06:49.869> money

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
pounds so aromatic that's a lot of money

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.619 
pounds so aromatic that's a lot of money
in<00:06:50.289> those<00:06:50.409> days
