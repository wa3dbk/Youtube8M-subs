and the cool thing about this mascara I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
and the cool thing about this mascara I
never<00:01:15.960> had<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> mascara<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.619> did<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> was

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
never had a mascara that did this was

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.660 
never had a mascara that did this was
the<00:01:17.490> wand<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.270> actually<00:01:19.080> rotates<00:01:19.490> 360<00:01:20.490> degrees

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the wand it actually rotates 360 degrees

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.399 
the wand it actually rotates 360 degrees
i<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.330> how<00:01:21.479> effective<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.200> going

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
i don't know how effective that's going

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.649 
i don't know how effective that's going
to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.939> apply<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to be just because i don't apply that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.420 
to be just because i don't apply that
much<00:01:24.840> pressure<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.799> i'm<00:01:25.890> applying<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
much pressure when i'm applying the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
much pressure when i'm applying the
mascara<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.540> seems<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> cool<00:01:28.350> concept

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
mascara so it seems like a cool concept

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
mascara so it seems like a cool concept
I<00:01:29.189> hope<00:01:29.700> he<00:01:29.820> doesn't<00:01:30.090> break<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.450> me<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.750> day

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I hope he doesn't break on me one day

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.380 
I hope he doesn't break on me one day
but<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.460> far<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.909> let's<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.360> how

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
but I think it so far so let's see how

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.200 
but I think it so far so let's see how
well<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.049> mascara<00:01:34.470> works<00:01:34.920> okay<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:35.909> right

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
well this mascara works okay so right

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.719 
well this mascara works okay so right
off<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> bat<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.659> love<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.950> feeling<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
off the bat I love the feeling of the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.450 
off the bat I love the feeling of the
wet<00:01:38.939> mascara<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.750> definitely<00:01:40.680> seems<00:01:41.250> like

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
wet mascara it definitely seems like

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.609 
wet mascara it definitely seems like
it's<00:01:41.700> coating<00:01:42.299> every<00:01:42.689> single<00:01:42.990> lash<00:01:43.200> that's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
it's coating every single lash that's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's coating every single lash that's
just<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.920> coat<00:01:44.149> not<00:01:45.149> bad<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.020> think

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
just one coat not bad what do you think

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.010

lashes<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:53.520> mean<00:01:53.760> hello<00:01:54.300> compared<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.050> this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
lashes I mean hello compared to this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
side and I definitely love the fact that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410 
side and I definitely love the fact that
it<00:01:58.380> separates<00:01:58.920> my<00:01:59.130> lashes<00:01:59.370> and<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> definitely

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
it separates my lashes and it definitely

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.380 
it separates my lashes and it definitely
doesn't<00:02:01.020> appear<00:02:01.560> clumpy<00:02:02.130> at<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.520> let's<00:02:03.030> see

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
doesn't appear clumpy at all let's see

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
doesn't appear clumpy at all let's see
what<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.690> second<00:02:04.110> coat<00:02:04.290> looks<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:10.430> second

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
what a second coat looks like second

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880 
what a second coat looks like second
coat<00:02:11.610> even<00:02:12.000> better<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.990> lashes<00:02:13.260> look<00:02:13.680> thicker

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
coat even better my lashes look thicker

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.520 
coat even better my lashes look thicker
than<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.550> first<00:02:14.910> coat<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.600> definitely<00:02:16.140> gave

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
than the first coat it definitely gave

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.910 
than the first coat it definitely gave
me<00:02:16.860> length<00:02:17.370> which<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.940> love<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.810> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.530> wished

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
me length which I love I kind of wished

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.600 
me length which I love I kind of wished
that<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> little<00:02:21.540> bit<00:02:21.720> more<00:02:21.930> clumpy

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
that it was a little bit more clumpy

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.670 
that it was a little bit more clumpy
surprisingly<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.020> does<00:02:25.260> still

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
surprisingly just because it does still

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.650 
surprisingly just because it does still
seem<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.370> bit<00:02:26.490> sparse<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.510> inner

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
seem a little bit sparse on the inner

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.240 
seem a little bit sparse on the inner
corner<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.080> my<00:02:28.170> eyes<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.070> probably

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
corner of my eyes and that's probably

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.550 
corner of my eyes and that's probably
because<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.240> close<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.780> Mara<00:02:31.080> doing

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
because I'm not up close to a Mara doing

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680 
because I'm not up close to a Mara doing
this<00:02:31.709> i'm<00:02:31.980> using<00:02:32.280> my<00:02:32.310> viewfinder<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:33.060> isn't

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
this i'm using my viewfinder which isn't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.320 
this i'm using my viewfinder which isn't
probably<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> best<00:02:34.350> thing<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:36.120> bad

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
probably the best thing but it's not bad

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.470 
probably the best thing but it's not bad
for<00:02:36.630> 599<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.770> think<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.490> worth<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.120> don't

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
for 599 I think it's worth it I don't

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.330 
for 599 I think it's worth it I don't
think<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.930> bad<00:02:40.260> drug<00:02:40.650> store<00:02:40.890> mascara<00:02:41.280> at

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
think it's a bad drug store mascara at
