00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.499 
oval shape kind of like a football and
then<00:00:13.110> stitch<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.710> long<00:00:14.219> straight<00:00:14.940> line<00:00:15.150> down

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
then stitch a long straight line down

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
then stitch a long straight line down
the<00:00:15.660> center<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.770> wanted<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the center of it if you wanted to you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.179 
the center of it if you wanted to you
could<00:00:17.550> also<00:00:17.760> fill<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.390> with<00:00:19.199> veins

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
could also fill that with veins

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.790 
could also fill that with veins
similar<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> regular<00:00:21.539> leaf<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
similar to a regular leaf but in this

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
similar to a regular leaf but in this
situation<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.400> was<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.449> split

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
situation I was really going for a split

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
situation I was really going for a split
petal<00:00:25.350> leaf<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.060> liked<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
petal leaf and I really liked that the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.839 
petal leaf and I really liked that the
way<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.750> came<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.369> something<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.490> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
way this came out something that you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.890 
way this came out something that you
know<00:00:29.910> there's<00:00:30.119> always<00:00:30.269> something<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> play

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
know there's always something to play

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.930 
know there's always something to play
with<00:00:30.929> always<00:00:31.320> something<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> try<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.730> every

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
with always something to try with every

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.410 
with always something to try with every
variation<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> started

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
variation that you do and so I started

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.780 
variation that you do and so I started
with<00:00:36.600> four<00:00:37.079> leaves<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.250> football

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
with four leaves for these football

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.660 
with four leaves for these football
shaped<00:00:39.120> leaves<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> center<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.640> then<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
shaped leaves in the center and then I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.900 
shaped leaves in the center and then I
started<00:00:42.210> working<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.920> Leafs<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.399> between

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
started working on the Leafs in between

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.750 
started working on the Leafs in between
these<00:00:45.329> four<00:00:45.719> leaves<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:47.280> made<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
these four leaves and I made them a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
these four leaves and I made them a
little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.300> bigger<00:00:48.719> than<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> initial<00:00:49.710> Leafs

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
little bit bigger than the initial Leafs

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.979 
little bit bigger than the initial Leafs
and<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.719> came

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and I really like the way that this came

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.279 
and I really like the way that this came
out<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.340> started<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.140> created<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
out I just started and created a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.439 
out I just started and created a
slightly<00:00:55.739> ever<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.190> slightly<00:00:56.550> bigger<00:00:56.879> made<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
slightly ever so slightly bigger made it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
slightly ever so slightly bigger made it
I<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.570> recite<00:00:58.020> ly<00:00:58.230> longer<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> ever<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I was recite ly longer and ever so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
I was recite ly longer and ever so
slightly<00:00:59.520> fatter<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> leaves<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> had

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
slightly fatter then the leaves that had

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
slightly fatter then the leaves that had
come<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> fore<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:03.030> liked<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> way

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
come to fore and I really liked the way

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
come to fore and I really liked the way
that<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.780> turned<00:01:04.110> out<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> center

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
that that turned out this is a center

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.300 
that that turned out this is a center
fill<00:01:06.240> design<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.799> work<00:01:07.950> best

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
fill design so it's going to work best

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.240 
fill design so it's going to work best
and<00:01:08.670> open<00:01:09.330> uncomplicated<00:01:10.229> areas<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.100> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and open uncomplicated areas of your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
and open uncomplicated areas of your
quilt<00:01:11.659> but<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.500> would

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
quilt but I really think that this would

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
quilt but I really think that this would
look<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:14.310> neat<00:01:14.520> stitched<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> center

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
look really neat stitched in the center

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
look really neat stitched in the center
of<00:01:15.689> an<00:01:16.020> applique<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.490> an

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
of an applique so if you had an

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.719 
of an applique so if you had an
applicator<00:01:18.210> hour<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.710> stitch<00:01:20.280> in

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
applicator hour you could stitch in

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.050 
applicator hour you could stitch in
quilting<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.869> flower<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> top<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
quilting a flower on top of it and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.230 
quilting a flower on top of it and
wouldn't<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.720> neat<00:01:24.900> looking<00:01:26.240> whenever

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
wouldn't that be neat looking whenever

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
wouldn't that be neat looking whenever
you<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.689> use<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.229> design<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:29.130> careful<00:01:29.579> about

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you do use this design be careful about

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.749 
you do use this design be careful about
your<00:01:30.509> stitches<00:01:31.290> building<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.890> especially<00:01:32.340> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
your stitches building up especially in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.240 
your stitches building up especially in
the<00:01:32.939> center<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> design<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.799> find

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the center of the design if you find

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
the center of the design if you find
that<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.729> difficult<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.270> stitch<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.960> that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that it's difficult to stitch in that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.039 
that it's difficult to stitch in that
area<00:01:37.619> try<00:01:38.130> slowing<00:01:38.490> down<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.479> approach<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
area try slowing down as you approach it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.530 
area try slowing down as you approach it
and<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.520> easier

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.720 

and<00:01:47.500> here's<00:01:47.860> what<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.130> looks<00:01:48.280> like<00:01:48.400> when<00:01:48.640> you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730
