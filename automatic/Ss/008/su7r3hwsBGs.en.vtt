00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
there that's the to be one pretty much

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.840 
there that's the to be one pretty much
because<00:03:19.990> it's<00:03:20.140> had<00:03:20.260> some<00:03:20.290> guy<00:03:20.650> behind<00:03:21.070> him<00:03:21.280> or

hopefully spawned right there in front
of<00:03:42.700> mel's<00:03:42.940> kind<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.390> bad<00:03:43.570> spawn<00:03:43.900> but

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
of mel's kind of a bad spawn but

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.000 
of mel's kind of a bad spawn but
whatever<00:03:44.500> i'll<00:03:44.770> take<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:46.740> but<00:03:47.740> stuff<00:03:47.950> like

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
whatever i'll take it but stuff like

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.480 
whatever i'll take it but stuff like
that<00:03:48.100> like<00:03:48.220> i<00:03:48.430> said<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:49.209> she<00:03:49.270> owned<00:03:49.480> GM<00:03:50.490> most

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
that like i said so she owned GM most

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.560 
that like i said so she owned GM most
the<00:03:51.580> time<00:03:51.700> you're<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.120> out<00:03:52.150> number

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
the time you're going to be out number

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.180 
the time you're going to be out number
and<00:03:52.660> that's<00:03:52.750> pretty<00:03:53.080> much<00:03:53.200> suggested<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.040> just

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
and that's pretty much suggested it just

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.800 
and that's pretty much suggested it just
trying<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.459> find<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.670> match<00:03:54.820> that's<00:03:55.060> fair<00:03:55.330> or<00:03:55.750> a

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
like all those were one view ones so

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.000 
like all those were one view ones so
that<00:04:05.500> was<00:04:05.770> beneficial<00:04:06.130> for<00:04:06.459> me<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.650> those<00:04:08.800> one
