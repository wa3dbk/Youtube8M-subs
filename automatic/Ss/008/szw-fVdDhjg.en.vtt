00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.019
 show how to make watercolors 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 very pretty with only markers 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.710
 let's go so I think everyone has 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
 felt in the water at home 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.590
 so I 'm using and destabilizing kind 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 68 because I find that there is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.270
 a lot of different colors for 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.580
 to make pretty degraded but wanted 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.780
 take any window then 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.329
 I will show you that we can also 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.510
 color as with real bags or 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.700
 queen of small drawings 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 so I use and stabilo kain 68 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.750
 so I ordered them on amazon 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.149
 jean cabot choice of 24 hours we cost 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.890
 16 euros pretty much but if you have 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.110
 felts with water used one 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 works very well too 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.059
 I also use watercolor paper 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 that I cut out in card format a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.329
 brush a water tank but a big 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.300
 simple jump with water enough 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.410
 widely and plastics you can 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.450
 also use pouches 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 plastics of your workbook there you 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.010
 must also in waterfall 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.620
 and that's all I protect my plan from 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.630
 Working with paper towels then I pose 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.760
 suma cardboard watercolor paper 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.680
 here are the colors that I choose so 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 as his name was so I 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.470
 decided to put neon colors in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.750
 my colors 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.570
 I put my plastic over the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.760
 card and I come have laid my color of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.729
 random way a little bit everywhere 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.500
 on the plastic no I try to do 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.770
 tasks in fact with the colors that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770
 I selected 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.010
 then I come small to my colors 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.189
 with water you can also 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.659
 use a water fogger and I 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.270
 delicately takes your classics that I 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.560
 go back I access position and there I 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 will mix the colors by pressing 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 so then the waltz to you from you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.720
 have fun with you to move the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.040
 colors and then when you like it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.040
 you remove the plastic 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.980
 I also show how reality a 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
 second map in bluish tones 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.520
 so again I put a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.520
 neon colors in the chosen colors 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.380
 to give a little pep to our 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.330
 cards 1 so plane was so I had 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.209
 wine colors and I'm doing exactly 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.020
 like just now then okay you 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.810
 to say that I was inspired by the chain 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.220
 of laetitia for this technique as well 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.780
 than that of stÃ©phanie so I you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.010
 put the link in info bar go them 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.739
 see because it's learning a lot of 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.090
 things about the chords she is we're going 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.780
 it is thanks to her that I discovered 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.720
 this technique 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.950
 these two techniques so the plastic and 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.950
 water markers in watercolor 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.080
 to color way to caurel so I 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.290
 put on felt or surely plastic 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.700
 then I take my brush that I 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.840
 wet with a little bit of water and I 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.610
 come to apply as a real 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.060
 watercolors often simple or any 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.190
 simply 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.380
 so again I use paper 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.120
 to corey underneath so make me some 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.849
 degraded one can even mix two 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.120
 colors like here with this blue and this 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.430
 rape is so I apply the colors I 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.220
 take them with my brush I place the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 clearer down and then you go 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.040
 see the colors blend together 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.040
 exactly like kul 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.840
 when we finish it we just have 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.550
 clean his plastic pallet so in 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.170
 China with water and we knew with a 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.910
 paper is not more complicated than that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.099
 and we have a clean plastic and 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.920
 that's it for this video so I hope that 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.239
 to say to himself hey you liked it I hope that it 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.739
 made you want to reproduce it 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.280
 do not hesitate to show me your little ones 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.840
 cards and you watercolors think about 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.330
 take a ride on the chains of 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.400
 the ethicist and stephanie you go 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.319
 to learn full of things full of 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.180
 different techniques and then they 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.799
 are super nice and so that's it 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.640
 go for a ride I put the links 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.680
 in info bar 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.670
 I make you big kisses and I 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.120
