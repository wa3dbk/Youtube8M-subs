00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
on the market there were no good looking

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.760 
on the market there were no good looking
affordable<00:00:36.090> fashionable<00:00:37.090> helmets<00:00:38.080> there<00:00:38.590> was

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
affordable fashionable helmets there was

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.390 
affordable fashionable helmets there was
a<00:00:38.800> gap<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.700> market<00:00:40.090> between<00:00:40.570> 90<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.500> 100

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
a gap on the market between 90 and 100

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.860 
a gap on the market between 90 and 100
years<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.970> helmets<00:00:43.330> were<00:00:43.390> not<00:00:43.660> so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
years the helmets were not so

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.340 
years the helmets were not so
good-looking<00:00:44.170> poor<00:00:44.920> quality<00:00:45.430> so<00:00:46.120> we<00:00:46.930> decide

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
good-looking poor quality so we decide

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.860 
good-looking poor quality so we decide
okay<00:00:47.830> maybe<00:00:48.040> we<00:00:48.640> have<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:49.090> good<00:00:49.510> opportunity

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
okay maybe we have a good opportunity

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.770 
need to have cover after the cover we
also<00:02:03.350> became<00:02:03.770> conscious<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:05.510> cover

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
also became conscious that the cover

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.200 
also became conscious that the cover
should<00:02:06.110> rotate<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:07.280> cover<00:02:07.670> should<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.179> a

realize that should be a kind of a wheel
not<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> sphere<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.700> wheel<00:02:14.170> after<00:02:15.170> these<00:02:15.410> ok

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
not a sphere but a wheel after these ok

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.950 
not a sphere but a wheel after these ok
we<00:02:16.010> need<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> center<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.910> common<00:02:17.390> center<00:02:17.780> after

we need a center a common center after

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.170 
we need a center a common center after
the<00:02:18.230> common<00:02:18.590> center<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.160> realize<00:02:19.610> ok<00:02:19.940> with<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the common center we realize ok with a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.090 
the common center we realize ok with a
common<00:02:20.600> set<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.140> put<00:02:21.380> asunder<00:02:21.800> visor

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
common set we can put asunder visor

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.380

this first model to switch ten which we

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.410 
this first model to switch ten which we
generally<00:03:03.980> gave<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.490> code<00:03:04.700> name<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.210> the
