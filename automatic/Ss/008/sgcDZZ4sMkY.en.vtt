 rotten infinite fire brown infinity 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.550
 this is not just just a trick of 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.110
 computer 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.460
 is on ps3 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.079
 in control 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.799
 I think we're saying it 's a product 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.590
 ps3 if you want this we can 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.850
 find us for cross and jairo 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.850
 john andrés 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.150
 or else andré jhon jairo in any 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.580
 of the two we are going to learn 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.870
 strong 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.980
 it's true you're going to throw the grenade 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.400
 infinite senator 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.440
 throw and throw and throw and go that never 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.440
 you just also follow genetics 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.570
 the people in this part I imagine that if 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.260
 they know him and this is where they will find 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:43.460
 his death are will come out a guy with one with 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.110
 a dynamite with that dynamite already when 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.160
 you kill that kind of exam the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.390
 half and they will meet their luck 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.760
 to see when doing it 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.520
 afterwards since we're going to be all 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.100
 bugs 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.100
 let's keep walking we're not leaving 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.230
 we keep walking 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.860
 Y 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.500
 we have arrived 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
 here will be your first single is called 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.440
 marquis trapeze 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.380
 this is achieving by killing all 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.480
 bugs but here and you have to be careful 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.750
 when they kill him because many times 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.240
 what happens is that they kill you 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.640
 it is out of area 9 the treasure appears 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.430
 that's why you have to be careful with the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.770
 treasure and with the subject that is some 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.770
 dynamite luck when it comes to feeling
