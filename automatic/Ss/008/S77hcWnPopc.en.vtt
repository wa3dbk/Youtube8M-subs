00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.900 
against Oklahoma and against Iowa State
the<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.980> think<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.340> might<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.490> hurting

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the thing I think that might be hurting

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.250 
the thing I think that might be hurting
their<00:00:30.029> national<00:00:30.420> perception<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.140> bit

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
their national perception a little bit

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.650 
their national perception a little bit
was<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> loss<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> TCU<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.239> bad<00:00:33.390> loss

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
was that loss to TCU that's a bad loss

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
was that loss to TCU that's a bad loss
in<00:00:33.870> big<00:00:34.050> 12<00:00:34.170> play<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.250> look

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
in big 12 play but I think if you look

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
in big 12 play but I think if you look
at<00:00:35.579> their<00:00:35.790> entire<00:00:36.059> resume<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> team

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
at their entire resume this is a team

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.170 
at their entire resume this is a team
that's<00:00:37.500> right<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> fringe<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:39.059> they

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that's right on the fringe and if they

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.340 
that's right on the fringe and if they
have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> good<00:00:39.480> week<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.690> week<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.170> think

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
have a good week this week I think

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
have a good week this week I think
they'll<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> national<00:00:41.129> rankings<00:00:41.160> well

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
they'll be in the national rankings well

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930 
they'll be in the national rankings well
for<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> team<00:00:42.780> 24th<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.770> RPI<00:00:44.190> who's<00:00:44.579> played

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
for a team 24th in the RPI who's played

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.340 
for a team 24th in the RPI who's played
the<00:00:45.149> 10th<00:00:45.390> toughest<00:00:45.780> schedule<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the 10th toughest schedule in the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
the 10th toughest schedule in the
country<00:00:46.739> why<00:00:47.489> aren't<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.969> ray<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.450> take

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
country why aren't they ray do you take

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.319 
country why aren't they ray do you take
it<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:48.899> back<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.379> TCU<00:00:49.829> game<00:00:50.039> well<00:00:50.910> III

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it all back to that TCU game well III

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
it all back to that TCU game well III
definitely<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> TCU<00:00:52.710> game<00:00:52.980> hurt<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
definitely think the TCU game hurt and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
definitely think the TCU game hurt and
you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:54.899> deserve<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> be

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you know I think they deserve to be

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
you know I think they deserve to be
ranked<00:00:55.739> personally<00:00:56.160> I'm<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.489> voter<00:00:56.789> I'm

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
ranked personally I'm not a voter I'm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.029 
ranked personally I'm not a voter I'm
not<00:00:57.180> someone<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.539> ranks<00:00:58.320> teams<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.800> think

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
not someone that ranks teams but I think

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520 
not someone that ranks teams but I think
the<00:00:59.160> consistency<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> they've<00:01:00.270> shown<00:01:00.570> in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the consistency that they've shown in

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170 
the consistency that they've shown in
big<00:01:01.770> 12<00:01:02.039> play<00:01:02.309> they're<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> team<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.850> has

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
big 12 play they're a team that has

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.899 
big 12 play they're a team that has
three<00:01:03.570> RPI<00:01:03.930> top<00:01:04.260> 50<00:01:04.619> wins<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.549> but

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
three RPI top 50 wins they have that but

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
three RPI top 50 wins they have that but
that<00:01:06.090> win<00:01:06.270> against<00:01:06.630> Texas<00:01:06.960> A&amp;M<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.530> was<00:01:07.799> early

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that win against Texas A&amp;M it was early

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
that win against Texas A&amp;M it was early
in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> season<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.780> Texas

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
in the season but you look at what Texas

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.859 
in the season but you look at what Texas
A&amp;M<00:01:10.500> has<00:01:10.530> done<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> SEC<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
A&amp;M has done in the SEC I think this is

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
A&amp;M has done in the SEC I think this is
a<00:01:12.900> team<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> struggled<00:01:14.340> with

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
a team that they have struggled with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
a team that they have struggled with
turnovers<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.630> struggled<00:01:16.080> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turnovers they have struggled with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
turnovers they have struggled with
making<00:01:16.320> free<00:01:16.740> throws<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.820> pretty

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
making free throws but they have pretty

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
making free throws but they have pretty
nice<00:01:18.330> balance<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.680> Karen

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
nice balance and you look at what Karen

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
nice balance and you look at what Karen
Aston<00:01:20.340> has<00:01:20.430> done<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.790> terms<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.150> building<00:01:21.509> her

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Aston has done in terms of building her

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
Aston has done in terms of building her
depth<00:01:21.900> she's<00:01:22.140> had<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> change<00:01:22.619> her<00:01:22.740> line<00:01:22.920> up

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
depth she's had to change her line up

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
depth she's had to change her line up
around<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> ton<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.689> they're<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> team

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
around the ton I think they're a team

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
around the ton I think they're a team
that's<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> the
