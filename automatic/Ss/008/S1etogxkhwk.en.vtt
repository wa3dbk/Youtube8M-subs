 I read the description of his ability 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.280
 I will use either in my speech 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.320

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.500

 numbering in order playing for rengar 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.770
 on the first level I pump our 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170
 first ability to be 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 more convenient to finish the monster on the second level 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 and pump our third ability 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.049
 what could have begun to be applied 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.939
 Opponent damage on me at the third level 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 I pump our second ability for 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.650
 order to stop health and with 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 level four and then I pump 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.070
 to the maximum of our 3d capable not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.320
 I forget to pump at the same time the ultimate 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 After our 3 abilities, I pump up to 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.170
 maximum our first ability 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.880
 and then the second instead of manna ringer 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 uses ferocity this resource 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.990
 replenished through use 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.700
 abilities here is a simple combination 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.310
 for dealing damage to an enemy character 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.810
 on line having four units of ferocity 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.420
 you use your first ability 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.190
 on the enemy causing damage getting 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.810
 enhanced ability to use your 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.240
 third ability to tie 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.950
 opponent and reuse third 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.869
 ability to do damage again 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.180
 while the enemy is tied it is also possible 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.380
 beat him auto attack 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.450
 playing on the line try constantly 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 have almost the maximum margin 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.810
 ferocity 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 it can help you in many situations 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.039
 In this example situation I needed 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.390
 stop the enemy in order to 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.220
 wait for your forester 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.410
 I used the third ability first 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.300
 in order to slow it down with me 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.070
 activated my enhanced third 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.489
 ability i tied my opponent 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.810
 waited for his ally and we took 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.250
 I use this combination for 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.769
 killing opponents with a small margin 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.840
 health having full ferocity i enter 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.489
 I jump into invisibility with my ultimate 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.769
 on the opponent use their first 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.420
 damage ability to preview 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.100
 in order to slow it down second for 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.830
 to fill the point of ferocity 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.880
 using our insatiable hydra artifact 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.320
 and finish off the enemy first ability 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.880
 if your ultimate on reloading you 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.130
 can use alternative 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.510

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.790
 ferocity first third ability 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.890
 what to tie the enemy then the first 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.340
 for dealing second and insatiable damage 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.010

 buy yourself an elixir of anger 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.599
 I set myself additional topics 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.250
 hidden totem che 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.050
 seeing totem and bottles of negar perfectly 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.300
 plays with characters like 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.370
 like loop if hayden plays for you 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.620
 ask her to put a trap near 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.870
 from some bushes and stuff yourself 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.729
 strip the rage to the end and tighten 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.770
 bushes waiting for any character 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.390
 which will enter into a trap 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.370
 the main task ren city batch yes and 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.410
 the whole game is the destruction of all 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.570
 most damaging opponents 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.890
 due to the huge damage and mobility 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.680
 renderer you can easily 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.660
 track down these opponents and quickly them 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.660
 kill while not getting much damage 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.770
 for example, I took quite a long and 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.510
 interesting game here you can see 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.700
 order of purchase items 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.500
 You may notice that I did not buy 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.170
 latest perfume vestment artifact 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.180
 either the guardian angel did it all 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.650
 because 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.760
 adakeri opponent collected himself 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.730
 studded armor 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.440
 this armor gives you enough armor and 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.900
 so I just simply could not 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.700
 kill him quickly so I collected two 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.200
 Artifact on armor penetration that is 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.930
 youmuu ghost blade 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.110
 and last breath it all depends on 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.730
 situations are also in order of purchase 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.770
 items you can look at 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.160
 time what minute what items am i 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.160

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.380
 with this character is quite simple 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.210
 to cope the main thing is not to die from the ring 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.979
 in the initial game and often warn 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.320
 your allies if you don't see him on 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.900
 lines or if you have a guess 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.130
 about where to go my rengar 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.350
 main characters who are easy 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.840
 coping with the render are ajax and 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.590
