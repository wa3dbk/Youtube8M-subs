to max go to town all that stats is to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
to max go to town all that stats is to
start<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> second<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.520> born<00:01:35.820> now

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

so<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.180> max<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.720> last<00:01:39.979> when<00:01:40.979> you're

this<00:01:58.259> fits<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.590> little<00:01:58.649> confusing<00:01:59.219> so<00:02:00.060> we'll

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
this fits a little confusing so we'll

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
this fits a little confusing so we'll

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
start working on the channel to align it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
during this process it's better to just

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.569

waste more time than moving far away the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.170 
waste more time than moving far away the
easiest<00:04:19.859> we're<00:04:20.039> gonna<00:04:20.130> max<00:04:20.430> out<00:04:20.609> powers<00:04:21.000> to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
easiest we're gonna max out powers to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.600 
easiest we're gonna max out powers to

grab ten girls from their game well the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.310 
grab ten girls from their game well the
Tigers<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> fairies<00:04:24.509> are<00:04:24.539> easier<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.139> get

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
Tigers and the fairies are easier to get

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.020 
Tigers and the fairies are easier to get
okay<00:04:25.680> give<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.949> little<00:04:26.160> less<00:04:26.340> power<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.729> time

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
okay give it a little less power to time

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.150 
okay give it a little less power to time
you<00:04:27.150> can<00:04:27.180> always<00:04:27.479> do<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.530> it's<00:04:28.650> faster<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.039> use

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
you can always do so it's faster to use

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.279 
you can always do so it's faster to use
them<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.580> long<00:04:29.789> run<00:04:30.090> even<00:04:30.720> if<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.110> takes

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
them in the long run even if it takes

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.460 
them in the long run even if it takes
longer<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.710> get<00:04:31.830> them<00:04:32.009> on<00:04:32.449> for<00:04:33.449> fly<00:04:33.690> condors

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
longer to get them on for fly condors

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.439 
longer to get them on for fly condors
are<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.740> easiest<00:04:35.070> they<00:04:35.759> give<00:04:35.940> an<00:04:36.060> insane

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
are the easiest they give an insane

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.969 
are the easiest they give an insane
amount<00:04:36.599> of<00:04:36.870> stats<00:04:37.110> in<00:04:37.320> multiple<00:04:37.800> categories

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
amount of stats in multiple categories

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.310 
amount of stats in multiple categories
so<00:04:38.699> really<00:04:38.970> they're<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> most<00:04:39.479> useful<00:04:39.780> animal

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
so really they're the most useful animal

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.560 
so really they're the most useful animal
there<00:04:40.470> is<00:04:40.610> but<00:04:41.610> smart<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.120> can<00:04:42.240> get<00:04:42.419> them

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
there is but smart you can get them

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.450 
there is but smart you can get them
super<00:04:42.900> quickly<00:04:43.139> in<00:04:43.440> two<00:04:43.620> at<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.800> time<00:04:43.830> from<00:04:44.220> loud

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460

and<00:04:48.090> while<00:04:48.240> they're<00:04:48.419> not<00:04:48.539> as<00:04:48.690> easy<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.990> get<00:04:49.169> in

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
and while they're not as easy to get in

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.740 
and while they're not as easy to get in
seals<00:04:49.590> they<00:04:49.949> give<00:04:50.130> more<00:04:50.310> stats<00:04:50.669> there<00:04:51.510> are<00:04:51.599> two
