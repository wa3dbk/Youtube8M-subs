 easy and fast 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.490
 state-of-the-art filter systems from home 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.410
 should be mounted 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 an example is our filter 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.869
 Complete set E10 for garden ponds up to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.820
 eight cubic meters suitable and like all

 are also available separately 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 the assembly is carried out on all models 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 after the same steps first

 filter sponge in all should 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.670
 filter systems mount them first 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 the rheinwasser omit the

 connection on shore enklÃ¤rer the uv 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.320
 becomes clearer then with the filter housing 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.320
 connected 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.609
 For this you need the included

 thanks to the automatic day night 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.300
 circuit but dj tonic energy saving 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.910
 now connect day tronic with the 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.800
