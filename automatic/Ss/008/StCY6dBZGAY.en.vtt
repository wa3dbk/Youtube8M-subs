 what will no longer be the headquarters of unasur 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.540
 because now it will have a wider headquarters 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.880
 and bigger and can become a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.140
 cultural space as it will be the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.080

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.410
 visas for the entry of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 Ecuadorian citizens who travel

 temporarily the North American country 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.710
 both for reasons of tourism and 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.820
 studies although there is still no 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.979
 agreement on this 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.450

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.060
 to sign a free trade agreement 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.770

 South American will seek the expansion of a 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.550

 Ecuador as flowers and tuna do not 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.259
 I think we could spoil the day was not 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.880
 neither is it a complex process 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.800
 I remind you that Mexico is a country that 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.240
 sign free trade agreements on 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.440
 Ecuador does not want a treaty of free 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.740
 Mexico trade wants an agreement 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.209
 comprehensive preferential type based 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.860
 in complementarity but 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.720
 safeguarding interests and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.790
 sensibilities and that's complex of 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.860
 achieve if you want it to be 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.930
 TLC removal would be extremely easy 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.580
 but if we want to have an agreement that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.920
 really represent and defend the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.750
 national interests that delay with
