these 3 Galaxy phones we've got the
Galaxy<00:00:08.010> j5<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.820> then<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.599> also<00:00:09.719> go<00:00:09.900> out<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
Galaxy j5 and then we also go out the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.480 
Galaxy j5 and then we also go out the
LXE<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:11.010> 5<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.179> galaxy<00:00:12.210> a5<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:14.280> just

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
LXE a 5 and the galaxy a5 so I'm just

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.390 
LXE a 5 and the galaxy a5 so I'm just
gonna<00:00:14.580> quickly<00:00:14.820> far<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> Geekbench

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
gonna quickly far up the Geekbench

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.790 
gonna quickly far up the Geekbench
benchmark<00:00:17.400> application<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.560> three

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
benchmark application so all these three

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.710 
benchmark application so all these three
phones<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.400> running<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> same<00:00:21.090> processor

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
phones are running the same processor

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.679 
phones are running the same processor
which<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> Qualcomm<00:00:22.740> Snapdragon<00:00:22.769> 410<00:00:23.699> but

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 but

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 but
it's<00:00:24.930> gonna<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.109> fun<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.590> check<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's gonna be fun to check out the the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.939 
it's gonna be fun to check out the the
actual<00:00:27.449> speed<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> cool<00:00:28.590> stuff<00:00:28.650> so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
actual speed and all that cool stuff so

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.890 
actual speed and all that cool stuff so
I'm<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.490> quickly<00:00:30.000> run<00:00:30.240> benchmark

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I'm just gonna quickly run benchmark

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
I'm just gonna quickly run benchmark
here<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.470> both<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.880> these<00:00:33.090> three<00:00:33.300> phones

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
here on both on all these three phones

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
here on both on all these three phones
so<00:00:34.190> let's<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:36.440> very<00:00:37.440> equal<00:00:40.760> really<00:00:41.760> really

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
so let's see very equal really really

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.420 
so let's see very equal really really
equal<00:00:42.329> speed<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.260> having<00:00:43.500> do

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
equal speed so this one is having do

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.369 
equal speed so this one is having do
gigabyte<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> RAM<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.480> having<00:00:45.600> 1.5

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
gigabyte of RAM this one is having 1.5

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.880 
gigabyte of RAM this one is having 1.5
and<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.760> having<00:00:48.059> also<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.899> 1<00:00:49.440> point<00:00:49.620> 5

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and this one is having also a 1 point 5

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
and this one is having also a 1 point 5
gigabyte<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.460> RAM<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.940> I'm<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.570> gonna<00:00:51.719> move

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
gigabyte of RAM so I'm just gonna move

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
gigabyte of RAM so I'm just gonna move
this<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> middle<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.670> one

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this one in the middle because this one

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
this one in the middle because this one
has<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> best<00:00:54.270> RAM<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.510> wow<00:01:01.430> they

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
has the best RAM so you can see wow they

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.630 
has the best RAM so you can see wow they
are<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.899> equal<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.140> mean<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> no

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
are really equal I mean there is no

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.429 
are really equal I mean there is no
difference<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.360> terms<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> benchmark

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
difference in terms of the benchmark

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.250 
difference in terms of the benchmark
speed<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.210> percentage<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.049> it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
speed you can see the percentage so it's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:24.420 
speed you can see the percentage so it's
gonna<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.530> fun<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> check<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> test<00:01:11.960> score

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430
