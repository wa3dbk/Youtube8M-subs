piece of French I think called so be
family<00:01:26.390> what<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.689> looks<00:01:27.049> like<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.200> group<00:01:27.619> of

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
family what it looks like a group of

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.889 
family what it looks like a group of
furniture<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.729> know<00:01:28.820> close<00:01:29.509> together

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
furniture you know close together

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.420

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
getting the picture taken so all these

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.389 
getting the picture taken so all these
pieces<00:01:31.640> all<00:01:31.880> fit<00:01:31.909> tightly<00:01:33.280> usually<00:01:34.280> you'd

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
pieces all fit tightly usually you'd

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.800 
pieces all fit tightly usually you'd
make<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.700> model<00:01:35.000> first<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.570> then<00:01:35.659> you'd

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
make the model first and then you'd

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.569 
make the model first and then you'd
build<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.140> piece<00:01:36.350> but<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.979> did<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.429> piece

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
build the piece but I did this piece

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.090 
build the piece but I did this piece
quite<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.789> few<00:01:37.969> years<00:01:38.119> ago<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.719> a<00:01:39.140> friend<00:01:40.039> of

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
quite a few years ago and a friend of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.529 
quite a few years ago and a friend of
mine<00:01:40.189> has<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.310> 3d<00:01:40.700> printer<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.240> thought<00:01:41.479> it

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
mine has a 3d printer so I thought it

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.599 
mine has a 3d printer so I thought it
would<00:01:41.689> be<00:01:41.750> fun<00:01:41.929> to<00:01:42.049> get<00:01:42.170> they<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:43.399> actual

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
would be fun to get they the actual

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.880 
would be fun to get they the actual
pieces<00:01:44.090> shrunk<00:01:44.539> down<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:44.990> smaller<00:01:45.259> size<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
pieces shrunk down to a smaller size and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.590 
pieces shrunk down to a smaller size and
you<00:01:46.490> know<00:01:46.579> there's<00:01:46.759> talk<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:46.939> me<00:01:47.090> making<00:01:47.299> toys
