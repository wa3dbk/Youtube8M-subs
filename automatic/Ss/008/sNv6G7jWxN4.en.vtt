behind you with your leg this is very
hard<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.149> need<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> practice<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> lot<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
hard you need to practice this a lot I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
hard you need to practice this a lot I
would<00:00:58.680> recommend<00:00:59.250> by<00:00:59.370> starting<00:00:59.820> by<00:00:59.940> putting

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
would recommend by starting by putting

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.540 
would recommend by starting by putting
the<00:01:00.300> ball<00:01:00.480> behind<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.370> doing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the ball behind you and then doing

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.700 
the ball behind you and then doing
circles<00:01:03.059> around<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> ball<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.590 

make<00:01:10.370> sure<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.700> make<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> slight<00:01:11.060> touch<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.510> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
make sure you make a slight touch to the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.820 
make sure you make a slight touch to the
ground<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.350> will<00:01:12.530> make<00:01:12.650> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
ground because this will make the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.320 
ground because this will make the
trigger<00:01:13.010> look<00:01:13.160> much<00:01:13.340> more<00:01:13.490> authentic<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:14.120> lot

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
trigger look much more authentic a lot

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.690 
trigger look much more authentic a lot
of<00:01:14.420> people<00:01:14.630> do<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.780> mistake<00:01:15.080> of<00:01:15.110> just

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
of people do the mistake of just

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.770 
of people do the mistake of just
shifting<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.730> little<00:01:16.820> ink<00:01:17.030> back<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.390> forth<00:01:17.600> in

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
shifting a little ink back and forth in

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.720 
shifting a little ink back and forth in
the<00:01:17.900> air<00:01:18.050> behind<00:01:18.380> them<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.710> I<00:01:19.070> would<00:01:19.580> not

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
the air behind them and I would not

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.710 
the air behind them and I would not
recommend<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.150> because<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.540> looks<00:01:20.570> really

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
recommend that because it looks really

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:37.359 
recommend that because it looks really
bad<00:01:34.690> this<00:01:35.690> full<00:01:35.900> circle<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:37.010> have<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.250> go

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
bad this full circle you have to go

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.730 
bad this full circle you have to go
around<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.940> ball<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:38.690> you're<00:01:39.200> like<00:01:39.500> is

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
around the ball so you're like is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.500 
around the ball so you're like is
further<00:01:39.979> than<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.280> ball<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.270> touch

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
further than the ball and then you touch

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.730 
further than the ball and then you touch
the<00:01:41.720> ground<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.920> front<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.340> pole<00:01:44.500> as<00:01:45.500> soon

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
the ground in front of the pole as soon

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.380 
the ground in front of the pole as soon
as<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.920> touch<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.130> ground<00:01:46.250> your<00:01:46.910> opponent<00:01:47.240> is

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
as you touch the ground your opponent is

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.060 
as you touch the ground your opponent is
gonna<00:01:47.509> think<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:47.990> you've<00:01:48.110> lost<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.440> ball<00:01:48.560> so

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
gonna think that you've lost the ball so

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.139 
gonna think that you've lost the ball so
you<00:01:49.130> let<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.369> ball<00:01:49.580> roll<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.820> little<00:01:50.000> bit

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
you let the ball roll a little bit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.240 
you let the ball roll a little bit
further<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.630> just<00:01:51.440> before<00:01:51.590> your<00:01:51.920> opponent

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
further and just before your opponent

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.950 
further and just before your opponent
grabs<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.520> ball<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.420> stick<00:01:53.660> your<00:01:53.780> leg<00:01:53.930> a

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
grabs the ball you stick your leg a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:05.649 
grabs the ball you stick your leg a
little<00:01:54.050> bit<00:01:54.170> further<00:01:54.440> out<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.649> grab<00:01:55.009> it

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.849 

now<00:02:06.659> there's<00:02:06.899> two<00:02:07.079> ways<00:02:07.109> to<00:02:07.289> continue<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
now there's two ways to continue this

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.609 
now there's two ways to continue this
move<00:02:08.069> some<00:02:09.060> people<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.140> drag<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
move some people like to just drag it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.210 
move some people like to just drag it
straight<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> other<00:02:11.069> way<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:13.220> while

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
straight the other way like this while

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.369 
straight the other way like this while
other<00:02:14.430> people<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.330> make<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.780> quick<00:02:16.080> step

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
other people like to make a quick step

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.020 
other people like to make a quick step
over<00:02:16.650> around<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.580> ensure<00:02:17.849> that

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
over around it because it's ensure that

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.309 
over around it because it's ensure that
you<00:02:18.120> have<00:02:18.239> your<00:02:18.360> body<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.870> your<00:02:18.959> opponent

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
you have your body of your opponent

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.780 
you have your body of your opponent
there's<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.769> bigger<00:02:20.010> chance<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.519> keep<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
there's a bigger chance you can keep the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:39.589 
there's a bigger chance you can keep the
ball<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.330> what<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.629> recommend<00:02:38.599> this

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
ball this is what I would recommend this

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.809 
ball this is what I would recommend this
move<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> reverse<00:02:40.650> step<00:02:40.860> over<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.519> makes

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
move with a reverse step over it makes

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.420 
move with a reverse step over it makes
the<00:02:42.000> move<00:02:42.120> look<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:43.290> lot<00:02:43.739> better<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> do

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the move look a lot better when you do

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.190 
the move look a lot better when you do
the<00:02:44.579> reverse<00:02:44.970> step<00:02:45.239> over<00:02:45.510> you're<00:02:45.870> actually

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the reverse step over you're actually

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600 
the reverse step over you're actually
gonna<00:02:46.380> have<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.860> drag<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.190> ball<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.579> other

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
gonna have to drag the ball on the other

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.949 
gonna have to drag the ball on the other
side<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.390> when<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.569> do<00:02:48.720> when<00:02:48.870> you

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
side of you that when you do when you

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
side of you that when you do when you
normally<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> last<00:02:49.650> wrap<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.099> that's

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
normally do the last wrap and that's

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.309 
normally do the last wrap and that's
because<00:02:50.819> if<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.360> do<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.599> reverse<00:02:51.750> step<00:02:52.079> over

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
because if you do the reverse step over

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.170 
because if you do the reverse step over
and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> ball<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.040> shifted<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
and then the ball is shifted to the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.220 
and then the ball is shifted to the
other<00:02:54.269> side<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.840> then<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.019> do<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
other side of you and then you do the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:05.470 
other side of you and then you do the
math<00:02:55.380> track

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.260 

the<00:03:05.900> reason<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.709> because<00:03:07.270> instead

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
the reason I do this is because instead

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.520 
the reason I do this is because instead
of<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.450> bulb<00:03:08.690> being<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.230> front<00:03:09.319> of<00:03:09.440> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
of the bulb being in front of the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:28.809 
of the bulb being in front of the
opponent<00:03:27.160> make<00:03:28.160> sure<00:03:28.340> when<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.580> do<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
opponent make sure when you do the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.940 
opponent make sure when you do the
mousetrap<00:03:29.239> really<00:03:30.020> act<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.530> you're<00:03:30.800> losing

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
mousetrap really act like you're losing

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.320 
mousetrap really act like you're losing
the<00:03:31.220> ball<00:03:31.400> because<00:03:31.730> that's<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.970> whole<00:03:32.060> point

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
the ball because that's the whole point

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.910 
the ball because that's the whole point
of<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.450> trick<00:03:32.660> do<00:03:33.140> we<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.319> that<00:03:33.440> my<00:03:33.680> body

of the trick do we do that my body

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
more you can even do the circling times

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.630 
more you can even do the circling times
