00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890

comfortable doing that type of medium

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.529 
comfortable doing that type of medium
and<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.810> then<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.410> went<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.910> local<00:04:29.280> media

for my painting I do think that's where
it<00:05:50.800> comes<00:05:50.979> from<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.550> really<00:05:51.849> feel<00:05:52.300> like<00:05:52.330> you

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
know I was think of myself as an

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.749 
know I was think of myself as an
instructor<00:05:56.289> first<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.190> watercolor<00:05:57.669> a
