00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.999 

a<00:00:00.079> few<00:00:01.079> weeks<00:00:01.199> ago<00:00:01.410> I'd<00:00:01.680> let<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.449> turnigy<00:00:03.449> 9x

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
a few weeks ago I'd let my turnigy 9x

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.430 
a few weeks ago I'd let my turnigy 9x
drain<00:00:05.009> all<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.370> way<00:00:05.490> down<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.440> life

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
drain all the way down with this life

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.490 
drain all the way down with this life
battery<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.309> can<00:00:08.460> see<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:08.820> actually

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
battery and you can see it's actually

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.990 
battery and you can see it's actually
puffed<00:00:10.500> up<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.980> looks<00:00:11.370> like<00:00:11.519> it's<00:00:11.700> ready<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
puffed up and looks like it's ready to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.140 
puffed up and looks like it's ready to
explode<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:13.019> at<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.950> point<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.460> time<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.940> was

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
explode but at that point in time I was

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.630 
explode but at that point in time I was
questioning<00:00:16.039> whether<00:00:17.039> or<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.550> was

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
questioning whether or not there was

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.340 
questioning whether or not there was
some<00:00:17.880> sort<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> alarm<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.869> would<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.140> known

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
some sort of alarm so I would have known

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.070 
some sort of alarm so I would have known
and<00:00:19.619> could<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.859> prevented<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:21.570> complete

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and could have prevented the complete

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.769 
and could have prevented the complete
discharge<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.949> my<00:00:23.100> life<00:00:23.400> battery<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.180> just

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
discharge of my life battery and just

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.650 
discharge of my life battery and just
last<00:00:24.990> night<00:00:25.260> after<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.369> couple<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.760> weeks<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
last night after a couple of weeks the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.839 
last night after a couple of weeks the
buzzer<00:00:27.900> started<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:29.699> there

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
buzzer started going off so right there

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.130 
buzzer started going off so right there
it's<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.330> eight<00:00:30.539> point<00:00:30.779> eight<00:00:30.869> volts

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's at about eight point eight volts

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.860 
it's at about eight point eight volts
and<00:00:31.700> what<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> wanted<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.660> show

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and what I wanted to do was just show

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.410 
and what I wanted to do was just show
you<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.130> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> these<00:00:35.940> zippy

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
you that you can get one of these zippy

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.819 
you that you can get one of these zippy
batteries<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> zippy<00:00:39.500> 1809<00:00:40.500> point

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
batteries this is a zippy 1809 point

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.060 
batteries this is a zippy 1809 point
nine<00:00:41.040> volt<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:42.660> works<00:00:42.899> great<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
nine volt that works great with the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.160 
nine volt that works great with the
turnigy<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.860> as<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.219> always<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
turnigy but there is as there always is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
turnigy but there is as there always is
one<00:00:49.170> little<00:00:49.770> problem<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.270> my<00:00:53.719> bat

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
one little problem so this is my bat

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.650 
one little problem so this is my bat
temporary<00:00:55.410> battery<00:00:55.800> solution<00:00:56.420> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> look

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
temporary battery solution if you look

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.490 
temporary battery solution if you look
at<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.930> connector<00:00:58.500> which<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.500> took

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
at this connector which is what I took

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
at this connector which is what I took
off<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.120> life<00:01:03.120> battery<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.820> soldered<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.060> my

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
off the life battery and soldered to my

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.070 
off the life battery and soldered to my
battery<00:01:08.520> pack<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.890> connector<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> different

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
battery pack that connector is different

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.800 
battery pack that connector is different
then<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> zippy<00:01:13.830> comes<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
then what the zippy comes with so this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
then what the zippy comes with so this
is<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.020> he's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.590> smaller<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> all

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is if he's a little bit smaller so all

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.780 
is if he's a little bit smaller so all
I'm<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.610> splice<00:01:20.610> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
I'm going to do is just splice this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.140 
I'm going to do is just splice this
connector<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:22.040> solder<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.790> leads

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
connector off solder this to these leads

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
connector off solder this to these leads
so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> zippy<00:01:25.439> soldered<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.369> ready

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so I have the zippy soldered and ready

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.020 
so I have the zippy soldered and ready
to<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:28.380> connector<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:29.790> life

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to go this connector from my life

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.810 
to go this connector from my life
battery<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.630> use<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.990> liquid<00:01:34.320> liquid

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
battery and I use this liquid liquid

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
battery and I use this liquid liquid
electrical<00:01:35.820> tape<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.360> secure<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.259> solder

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
electrical tape to secure the solder

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
electrical tape to secure the solder
connection<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.780> case<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> aren't<00:01:40.350> aware<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
connection in case you aren't aware of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.460 
connection in case you aren't aware of
this<00:01:40.829> stuff<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:42.030> real<00:01:43.040> kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> gummy<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
this stuff it's real kind of gummy and

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.080 
this stuff it's real kind of gummy and
tough<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> work<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.159> small<00:01:47.520> connections

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
tough to work with on small connections

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
tough to work with on small connections
but<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.259> seems<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> reasonable<00:01:50.820> job<00:01:50.850> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
but it seems to do a reasonable job so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.770 
but it seems to do a reasonable job so
I'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.860> time<00:01:53.070> being

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
I'm going to use it for the time being

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
I'm going to use it for the time being
so<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> original<00:01:55.079> connector<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> left

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
so the original connector on the left

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.389 
so the original connector on the left
and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.110> soldered<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.159> life

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and the one I soldered on from my life

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.660 
and the one I soldered on from my life
battery<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.770> let's<00:02:01.979> plug<00:02:02.460> up
