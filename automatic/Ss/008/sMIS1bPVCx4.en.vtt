taking the glass right to the very

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.610 
taking the glass right to the very
perimeter<00:00:57.340> it's<00:00:58.030> just<00:00:58.360> display<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.110> then<00:00:59.410> no

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
perimeter it's just display and then no

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.890 
perimeter it's just display and then no
display<00:01:00.040> that's<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.700> I<00:01:00.820> mean<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.720> are<00:01:01.870> just

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
display that's it I mean you are just

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.350 
display that's it I mean you are just
completely<00:01:03.390> consumed<00:01:04.390> by<00:01:04.750> by<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.710> image

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.110 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I
love<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> way<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.070> scales<00:03:15.520> from<00:03:15.880> being

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
love the way that it scales from being

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.280 
love the way that it scales from being
something<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.830> apparently<00:03:18.220> simple

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
something that is that apparently simple

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.590 
something that is that apparently simple
to<00:03:20.290> actually<00:03:20.590> being<00:03:21.060> really<00:03:22.060> remarkably

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
to actually being really remarkably

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.440 
to actually being really remarkably
sophisticated<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:23.620> mean<00:03:23.799> we<00:03:24.549> finally<00:03:25.239> figured

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
sophisticated I mean we finally figured

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.259 
sophisticated I mean we finally figured
out<00:03:25.690> how<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.200> take<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.519> multi-touch

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
out how to take the multi-touch

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.400 
out how to take the multi-touch
technology<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:29.610> implement<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.820> mouse

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
technology and implement it on a mouse

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.530 
technology and implement it on a mouse
it's<00:03:32.410> still<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.769> point<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.250> click<00:03:33.370> mouse<00:03:33.730> but

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
it's still a point and click mouse but

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.410 
it's still a point and click mouse but
now<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.290> entire<00:03:35.830> top<00:03:36.459> surface<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.209> mouse

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
now the entire top surface of the mouse

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.110 
now the entire top surface of the mouse
is<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:38.320> basically<00:03:38.620> as<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.130> multi<00:03:39.430> touch<00:03:39.549> sensor

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
is is basically as a multi touch sensor

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.000 
is is basically as a multi touch sensor
this<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.080> smartest<00:03:41.440> Mouse<00:03:41.620> we've<00:03:41.860> ever

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
this is the smartest Mouse we've ever

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.160 
this is the smartest Mouse we've ever
made<00:03:42.220> there's<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.060> chip<00:03:43.390> inside<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.989> acts

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
made there's a chip inside that acts

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.410 
made there's a chip inside that acts
essentially<00:03:44.739> as<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:44.860> brain<00:03:45.160> as<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:46.090> put<00:03:46.299> your

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
essentially as a brain as you put your

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.850 
essentially as a brain as you put your
fingers<00:03:46.750> on<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.989> top<00:03:47.200> shelf<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.650> can

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
fingers on the top shelf it can

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.550 
fingers on the top shelf it can
determine<00:03:48.459> where<00:03:49.090> they're<00:03:49.329> located<00:03:49.510> how<00:03:50.260> many

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
determine where they're located how many

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.069 
determine where they're located how many
you<00:03:50.769> have<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.310> through<00:03:51.940> your<00:03:52.120> gesture<00:03:52.660> your

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
you have and through your gesture your

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.020 
you have and through your gesture your
movement<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.829> can<00:03:54.100> determine<00:03:54.610> what<00:03:54.760> your

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
movement it can determine what your

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.979 
movement it can determine what your
intent<00:03:55.390> is<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:57.100> can<00:03:57.370> scroll<00:03:57.970> anywhere<00:03:58.900> on

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
intent is you can scroll anywhere on

intent is you can scroll anywhere on
that<00:03:59.140> top<00:03:59.350> surface<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.950> can<00:04:00.190> see<00:04:00.459> why<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:00.790> it

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
that top surface you can see why it it

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.530 
that top surface you can see why it it
is<00:04:01.890> incredibly<00:04:02.890> intuitive<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.670> mean<00:04:03.820> you<00:04:04.360> can

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
is incredibly intuitive I mean you can

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.720 
is incredibly intuitive I mean you can
use<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.049> without<00:04:05.590> thought<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.340> know<00:04:06.489> it's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
use it without thought you know it's

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.280 
use it without thought you know it's
just<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.390> way<00:04:07.600> that<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.989> would<00:04:08.110> have

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
expected the mouth should have always

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.440 
expected the mouth should have always
worked

class technologies that are really built

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.520 
class technologies that are really built
in<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.910> consumer<00:04:43.600> computer<00:04:46.320> we're<00:04:47.320> really

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
in a consumer computer we're really

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.770 
in a consumer computer we're really
proud<00:04:47.889> of<00:04:47.950> this<00:04:48.220> imac<00:04:48.669> especially<00:04:49.479> in<00:04:49.600> terms

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
proud of this imac especially in terms

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.960 
proud of this imac especially in terms
of<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.139> environment<00:04:50.710> but<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.520> key<00:04:51.669> with<00:04:51.850> the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
of the environment but the key with the

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.300 
of the environment but the key with the
environmental<00:04:52.660> story<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.350> it's<00:04:53.590> never<00:04:54.040> over

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
environmental story is it's never over

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.000 
environmental story is it's never over
because<00:04:55.270> as<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.660> learn<00:04:55.900> how<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> remove

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
because as you learn how to remove

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.670 
because as you learn how to remove
toxins<00:04:57.880> we<00:04:58.419> change<00:04:58.690> your<00:04:58.750> focus<00:04:59.020> from<00:04:59.350> doing

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
toxins we change your focus from doing

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.980 
toxins we change your focus from doing
that<00:04:59.889> too<00:05:00.610> how<00:05:01.270> do<00:05:01.330> we<00:05:01.479> build<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:01.930> thing

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
that too how do we build this thing

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.800 
that too how do we build this thing
really<00:05:02.700> energy-efficient<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.790> not<00:05:04.419> just<00:05:04.660> to

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
really energy-efficient and not just to

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.260 
really energy-efficient and not just to
meet<00:05:04.960> energy<00:05:05.200> star<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.610> go<00:05:06.729> way<00:05:06.910> beyond

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
meet energy star but to go way beyond

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.520 
meet energy star but to go way beyond
that<00:05:08.639> we<00:05:09.639> take<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.880> life<00:05:10.240> cycle<00:05:10.570> view<00:05:11.020> of<00:05:11.260> the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
that we take a life cycle view of the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.430 
that we take a life cycle view of the
carbon<00:05:11.889> footprint<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:13.419> find<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:13.810> the

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
carbon footprint and you find that the

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.710 
carbon footprint and you find that the
customers<00:05:14.889> use<00:05:15.100> of<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.370> computer<00:05:15.880> has<00:05:16.450> the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
customers use of the computer has the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.110 
customers use of the computer has the
biggest<00:05:16.960> impact<00:05:17.350> on<00:05:18.070> its<00:05:18.250> carbon<00:05:18.520> footprint

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
biggest impact on its carbon footprint

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.020 
biggest impact on its carbon footprint
and<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:20.110> in<00:05:20.380> this<00:05:20.770> product<00:05:21.310> we<00:05:21.490> really<00:05:21.789> drove

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
and so in this product we really drove

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.240 
and so in this product we really drove
at<00:05:22.270> energy<00:05:22.690> efficiency<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.470> that's<00:05:24.010> where<00:05:24.220> we

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
at energy efficiency and that's where we

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.400 
at energy efficiency and that's where we
have<00:05:24.460> a<00:05:24.490> tremendous<00:05:24.820> advantage<00:05:25.510> because<00:05:26.050> we

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
have a tremendous advantage because we

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.860 
have a tremendous advantage because we
not<00:05:26.860> only<00:05:26.919> build<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.880> hardware<00:05:28.060> but<00:05:28.600> we<00:05:28.720> also

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
not only build the hardware but we also

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.740 
not only build the hardware but we also
create<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.590> software<00:05:30.039> so<00:05:30.760> we're<00:05:31.419> able<00:05:31.539> to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
create the software so we're able to

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.659 
create the software so we're able to
really<00:05:32.289> manage<00:05:32.500> power<00:05:32.919> and<00:05:33.160> throughout<00:05:33.460> the

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
really manage power and throughout the

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.420 
really manage power and throughout the
system<00:05:33.930> extensively<00:05:34.930> we<00:05:35.740> even<00:05:35.950> power<00:05:36.160> down

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
system extensively we even power down

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.480 
system extensively we even power down
processors<00:05:37.120> between<00:05:37.539> keystrokes<00:05:38.260> and<00:05:38.500> I

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
processors between keystrokes and I

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.879 
processors between keystrokes and I
think<00:05:39.760> we're<00:05:39.970> really<00:05:40.180> unique<00:05:40.720> in<00:05:41.350> how<00:05:41.560> far

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
think we're really unique in how far

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.920 
think we're really unique in how far
we've<00:05:42.190> pushed<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:43.120> hardware<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:43.780> software

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
we've pushed that hardware and software

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.590 
we've pushed that hardware and software
technology<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.889> do<00:05:45.100> that

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.930 

with<00:05:49.170> this<00:05:49.320> imac<00:05:49.710> we<00:05:50.100> took<00:05:50.250> everything<00:05:50.550> so

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
with this imac we took everything so

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.570 
with this imac we took everything so
much<00:05:51.120> further<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:52.290> displays<00:05:52.620> are<00:05:52.800> bigger<00:05:52.950> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
much further the displays are bigger the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.970 
much further the displays are bigger the
pixel<00:05:53.940> count<00:05:54.150> is<00:05:54.330> higher<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:55.290> comes<00:05:55.530> standard

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
pixel count is higher it comes standard

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.410
