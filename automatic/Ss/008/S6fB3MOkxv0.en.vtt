 Hello everyone, Alyona is good with you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 to my channel today i will show 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.170
 you new design of your eyebrows for 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.599
 everyday makeup 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.230
 if you are interested please stay with 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.420
 enjoy me 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 I draw the corrector line over the eyebrow I 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.100
 peeped such a chip American 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.519
 bloggers they do it with a brush and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.650
 concealer I'm proofreader I'm all this 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.599
 I rub it neatly so that it is not 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.850
 noticeably 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 next I take the usual eyebrow brush and 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.710
 combing the hairs up first and then 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 along the line of growth of these very hairs 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.329
 the main rule filling eyebrows is 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.000
 a sharp pencil a pencil should always 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.520
 be well sharpened my pencil from 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.320
 flormar brown shade that me 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 really like a long time ago in my 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.640
 favorites let's say so I take draw a line 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.010
 under eyebrow line above eyebrow line above 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.310
 eyebrow i draw little corner 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 Or call the house and how you want later I 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.369
 the strokes shade the gap between 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.130
 my top line myself 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.899
 painted and bottom 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.630
 the higher the upper line is drawn the wider 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.930
 there will be an eyebrow of the bottom line too 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.159
 you can make a little retreat brief 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.289
 from the edge of the eyebrows but then the gap between 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.979
 eyelashes and eyebrows were respectively 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.310
 less i raise my eyebrow a little bit 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.710
 cedar brush from the same pencil and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.229
 I soften the lines that I applied 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 a pencil 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.450
 prepare let's say eyebrow to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.030
 applying shadows 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.819
 brush flat from mallow now you 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.009
 see matte brown shadows 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.670
 the same I draw a line above the eyebrow under 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.850
 eyebrow 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.060
 but 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.770
 more graphical business let's say eyebrows 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.200
 more highlighting the corner and the shadows they 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.959
 darker than pencil pencil for me 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.670
 now light watt 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.880
 I need my eyebrows a little bit darker 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.010
 to match my hair 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.750
 that is, I make such a little corner and eyebrow 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.819
 I get more graphical but I 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.270
 again for everyday makeup i 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.670
 don't make me too wide 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.640
 Now I really like this filling and 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.670
 now you can see a comparison of one 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.790
 beautiful eyebrow another 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.650
