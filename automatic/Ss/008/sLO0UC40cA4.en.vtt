00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.900
 the abyss of howls a crack without 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 background surrounded by a fortress 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.789
 thousand-year-old sculptured on a glacier 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.560
 nobody remembers who built this place 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.870
 nobody knows its purpose 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.530
 nobody except me 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.920
 before aje he cheered up before 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.480
 the magic destroyed the broken peaks 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.370
 before the desert will swallow its 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.840
 rhyme 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.220
 It was the time of the three sisters 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 we were so young then 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.100
 a muddy 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.909
 seriousness and I 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.159
 and sandra 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.840
 the vigilant guardians of ice 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.380
 they lived here back then 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.450
 I do not know where they came from 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.450
 but I know they were powerful 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.800
 they gave us gifts 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.300
 they shared their magic they converted us 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.409
 in immortal 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.789
 they called us 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.789
 and jose the ice 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.530
 in return we gave them everything they wanted 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.790
 a powerful fortress a vast empire 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.790
 show loyalty 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.530
 It was a small price to pay 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.850
 I did not see them 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.390
 he cried out freedom like a girl 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 spoiled 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.360
 he demanded to be able to choose 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.690
 He sowed the field of rebellion and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.690
 treason 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.720
 this is where it happened 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.120
 on one side the ice watchers in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.150
 the other 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.150
 to muddy and her horde of children of ice 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.959
 many children of the ice died that day 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.739
 but in the end they were able to 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.739
 vigilantes 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.890
 Avalos threw the abyss 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.890
 crying 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.720
 I will never forgive him 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.330
 I already got revenge 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.569
 but that's another story
