songs got on a record though we should
make<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.229> think<00:04:26.409> they're<00:04:26.530> not<00:04:26.560> good<00:04:26.860> that's

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
make you think they're not good that's

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.310 
make you think they're not good that's
not<00:04:27.250> what<00:04:27.460> it's<00:04:27.580> about

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
not what it's about

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.200 
not what it's about
so<00:04:29.320> then<00:04:29.860> when<00:04:30.010> we<00:04:30.039> got<00:04:30.250> home<00:04:30.340> we<00:04:30.550> decided<00:04:30.760> we

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
so then when we got home we decided we

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.800 
so then when we got home we decided we
would<00:04:31.389> try<00:04:31.720> writing<00:04:32.280> together<00:04:33.280> separately

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
would try writing together separately

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.480 
would try writing together separately
that's<00:04:34.810> not<00:04:34.960> just<00:04:35.139> as<00:04:35.289> weird<00:04:35.560> right<00:04:35.680> now<00:04:35.710> but

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
that's not just as weird right now but

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.360 
that's not just as weird right now but
but<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.180> made<00:04:38.300> sense<00:04:38.330> in<00:04:38.690> our<00:04:38.780> world<00:04:39.050> and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
but it made sense in our world and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.620 
but it made sense in our world and
anyway<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.520> was<00:04:40.639> like<00:04:40.759> a<00:04:40.789> like<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.240> three<00:04:41.509> and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
anyway that was like a like a three and

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.850
