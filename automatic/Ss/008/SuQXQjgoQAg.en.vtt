App Store so I figure I'll do a gameplay
for<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.350> guys<00:00:34.530> cuz<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> little

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
for you guys cuz I was a little

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.830 
for you guys cuz I was a little
skeptical<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.790> purchasing<00:00:36.330> this<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.660> first

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
skeptical at purchasing this at first

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.870 
skeptical at purchasing this at first
just<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.560> price<00:00:37.740> point<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
just because of the price point but it

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.540 
just because of the price point but it
is<00:00:38.910> definitely<00:00:39.570> worth<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.900> so<00:00:40.590> first<00:00:41.370> here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
is definitely worth it so first here

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.770 
is definitely worth it so first here
well<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> guess<00:00:41.880> we'll<00:00:42.030> start<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> menu

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
well I guess we'll start with the menu

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
well I guess we'll start with the menu
you<00:00:43.470> have<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.710> single<00:00:44.160> player<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.820> have

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you have a single player and you do have

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.460 
you have a single player and you do have
multi<00:00:45.360> player<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.630> would<00:00:45.840> recommend<00:00:46.230> doing<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
multi player I would recommend doing a

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.170 
multi player I would recommend doing a
multi<00:00:46.770> player<00:00:46.980> probably<00:00:47.310> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> iPad

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
multi player probably on the iPad

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.960 
multi player probably on the iPad
because<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.290> local<00:00:50.010> multiplayer<00:00:50.250> so

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
because it is a local multiplayer so

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.910 
because it is a local multiplayer so
you'll<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.750> playing<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> same<00:00:52.680> device

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you'll be playing on the same device

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.620 
you'll be playing on the same device
which<00:00:53.400> would<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.820> difficult<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.450> an

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
which would be a little difficult on an

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.460 
which would be a little difficult on an
iPhone<00:00:55.080> or<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.440> iPad<00:00:55.770> iPod<00:00:57.020> but<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.260> cool

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
iPhone or an iPad iPod but it is cool

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.420 
iPhone or an iPad iPod but it is cool
that<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.710> does<00:00:58.830> have<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> multiplayer

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that it does have the multiplayer

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.550 
that it does have the multiplayer
because<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.560> get

have saved 42 clones so far you'll see
that<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> clones<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.359> in<00:01:12.539> a<00:01:12.600> minute<00:01:12.929> I've

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that the clones are in a minute I've

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.739 
that the clones are in a minute I've
completed<00:01:14.100> 15<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> hundred<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.390> 20

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
completed 15 of the hundred and 20

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:19.160 
completed 15 of the hundred and 20
missions<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:18.149> keep<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.539> mind<00:01:18.569> there's<00:01:18.929> three

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

missions<00:01:19.530> per<00:01:19.740> level<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.539> would<00:01:21.630> be

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
missions per level and so that would be

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.309 
missions per level and so that would be
40<00:01:22.380> levels<00:01:22.560> total<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.249> far<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> I've<00:01:24.780> gotten

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
jungle now the thing I like about this

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.710 
jungle now the thing I like about this
game<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.890> much<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.730> foreground<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.540> all

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
game so much is the foreground is all

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
game so much is the foreground is all
blacked<00:02:30.050> out<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.130> kind<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.340> hard<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.610> tell

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
blacked out so it's kind of hard to tell

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.270 
blacked out so it's kind of hard to tell
what<00:02:31.970> obstacles<00:02:32.510> are<00:02:32.630> what<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.190> a

kind<00:02:34.460> of<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.640> cool<00:02:34.880> way<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.120> make<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.420> game<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
kind of a cool way to make a game the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.080 
kind of a cool way to make a game the
background<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.650> obviously<00:02:37.040> like<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.310> kind<00:02:38.030> of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090

throughout<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> game<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:44.900> anyways<00:02:45.200> let's

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
throughout the game but anyways let's

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.020 
throughout the game but anyways let's
just<00:02:45.470> play<00:02:45.770> is<00:02:45.920> not<00:02:46.100> simple<00:02:46.610> controls

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
just play is not simple controls

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.100 
just play is not simple controls
OneTouch<00:02:47.480> controls<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.890> basically<00:02:49.250> are

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
OneTouch controls and you basically are

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.949 
OneTouch controls and you basically are
what<00:02:51.110> looks<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.440> me<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:52.100> be<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.390> fluffy<00:02:53.390> bed<00:02:53.630> but

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
what looks to me to be a fluffy bed but

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.900 
what looks to me to be a fluffy bed but
it<00:02:54.050> does<00:02:54.200> not<00:02:54.320> actually<00:02:54.709> stay<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.070> game<00:02:55.190> so

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
it does not actually stay in the game so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.400 
it does not actually stay in the game so
as<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> see<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:56.600> kind<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.810> touch<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.170> screen

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
as you see just kind of touch the screen

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.260 
as you see just kind of touch the screen
and<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.650> will<00:02:57.770> keep<00:02:58.070> your<00:02:58.310> creature<00:02:58.670> flapping

the object is to at least survive and
get<00:03:15.739> through<00:03:16.040> at<00:03:16.130> least<00:03:16.190> with<00:03:16.519> one<00:03:16.760> clone<00:03:17.060> but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
get through at least with one clone but

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.840 
get through at least with one clone but
I'll<00:03:18.350> see<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.799> right<00:03:19.130> there<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.310> killed<00:03:19.580> all

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
I'll see it right there that killed all

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.460 
I'll see it right there that killed all
my<00:03:20.000> clones<00:03:20.239> cuz<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.600> blasted<00:03:21.049> me<00:03:21.140> off<00:03:21.290> the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
my clones cuz it blasted me off the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.270 
my clones cuz it blasted me off the
screen

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
screen

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.039 
screen
these<00:03:22.730> are<00:03:22.880> mines<00:03:23.209> as<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.600> can<00:03:23.720> see<00:03:23.810> they<00:03:23.900> got

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
these are mines as you can see they got

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.470 
these are mines as you can see they got
like<00:03:24.200> little<00:03:24.519> pointy<00:03:25.519> edges<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:26.090> watch<00:03:26.299> out

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
like little pointy edges so watch out

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.000 
like little pointy edges so watch out
for<00:03:26.600> those<00:03:26.750> because<00:03:26.870> those<00:03:27.380> will<00:03:27.530> blast<00:03:27.799> you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
for those because those will blast you

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.280 
for those because those will blast you
all<00:03:28.100> over<00:03:28.250> hell<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:29.720> like<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.959> was<00:03:30.049> saying

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
all over hell and I like I was saying

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.380 
all over hell and I like I was saying
the<00:03:30.920> main<00:03:31.100> objective<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.760> actually<00:03:32.239> get

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
the main objective is to actually get

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.180 
the main objective is to actually get
through<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.660> level<00:03:32.930> but<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.739> get<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.890> lot<00:03:34.160> more

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
through the level but to get a lot more

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.920 
through the level but to get a lot more
points<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.730> actually<00:03:35.209> are<00:03:35.390> gonna<00:03:35.540> want<00:03:35.780> to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
points you actually are gonna want to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.289 
points you actually are gonna want to
save<00:03:36.830> as<00:03:37.010> many<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.310> these<00:03:37.400> clones<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.060> can

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
save as many of these clones as you can

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.360 
save as many of these clones as you can
as<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:38.989> see<00:03:39.350> right<00:03:39.500> there<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.739> actually<00:03:39.950> had<00:03:40.220> to

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
as you see right there I actually had to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.820 
as you see right there I actually had to
shrink<00:03:40.549> my<00:03:40.820> size<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.420> actually<00:03:41.900> get<00:03:42.590> through

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
shrink my size to actually get through

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.280 
shrink my size to actually get through
this<00:03:42.980> part<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.269> there's<00:03:44.750> lots<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.230> different

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
this part so there's lots of different

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.910 
this part so there's lots of different
little<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.950> know<00:03:46.070> objectives<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.030> kind<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.780> a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
little you know objectives and kind of a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.190 
little you know objectives and kind of a
you<00:03:48.920> know<00:03:49.010> what<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.160> need<00:03:49.310> almost<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:49.850> a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
you know what you need almost like a

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.090 
you know what you need almost like a
strategy<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.320> get<00:03:51.410> through<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.709> game<00:03:51.920> on

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
strategy to get through this game on

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.430 
strategy to get through this game on
some<00:03:52.310> levels<00:03:52.640> this<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.660> beginning<00:03:54.110> level<00:03:54.350> so

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
some levels this is a beginning level so

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.830 
some levels this is a beginning level so
it<00:03:54.530> isn't<00:03:54.769> too<00:03:54.799> bad<00:03:55.150> well<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.180> got<00:03:56.420> most<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.780> my

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
it isn't too bad well I got most of my

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.090 
it isn't too bad well I got most of my
clones<00:03:57.260> turret<00:03:57.680> there<00:03:57.830> that's<00:03:57.980> pretty

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
clones turret there that's pretty

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.810 
clones turret there that's pretty
impressive

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
impressive

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.490 
impressive
let's<00:03:59.690> shrink<00:03:59.930> even<00:04:00.110> smaller<00:04:00.920> oh<00:04:00.950> god<00:04:02.500> kill

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
let's shrink even smaller oh god kill

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.979 
let's shrink even smaller oh god kill
them<00:04:03.620> all<00:04:03.739> again<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:05.269> all<00:04:05.299> my<00:04:05.570> clones<00:04:05.840> got

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
them all again so all my clones got

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.410 
them all again so all my clones got
killed<00:04:06.760> alright<00:04:07.760> let's<00:04:08.090> see<00:04:08.180> if<00:04:08.239> we<00:04:08.299> get

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
killed alright let's see if we get

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.340 
killed alright let's see if we get
through<00:04:08.630> this<00:04:08.690> without<00:04:08.959> dying

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
through this without dying

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.979 
through this without dying
oh<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:10.160> made<00:04:10.549> it<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:11.209> missed<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.540> client<00:04:11.870> up

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
oh I made it and I missed a client up

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.160 
oh I made it and I missed a client up
there<00:04:12.200> we<00:04:12.290> go<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.410> got<00:04:12.560> it

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
there we go I got it

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.870 
there we go I got it
pick<00:04:14.590> up<00:04:14.680> couple<00:04:14.920> more<00:04:15.040> clones<00:04:15.280> it's<00:04:15.610> hoping

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
pick up couple more clones it's hoping

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.539 
pick up couple more clones it's hoping
not<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.000> die<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.799> there's<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.950> end<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.459> the

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
not to die and there's the end of the

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.500 
not to die and there's the end of the
level<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:18.820> go<00:04:18.940> through<00:04:19.120> kind<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.329> like<00:04:19.480> a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
level you go through kind of like a

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.780 
level you go through kind of like a
portal<00:04:19.959> thing<00:04:20.170> now<00:04:21.040> at<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.250> end<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.609> level

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
portal thing now at the end of the level

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.280 
portal thing now at the end of the level
you<00:04:21.940> do<00:04:22.090> have<00:04:22.240> these<00:04:22.360> kind<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.750> egg<00:04:22.960> looking

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
you do have these kind of egg looking

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.510 
you do have these kind of egg looking
things<00:04:23.500> these<00:04:23.680> are<00:04:23.800> actually<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.160> missions

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
things these are actually the missions

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.420 
things these are actually the missions
each<00:04:25.420> level<00:04:25.750> has<00:04:25.870> its<00:04:25.990> own<00:04:26.290> missions<00:04:26.680> so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
each level has its own missions so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.020 
each level has its own missions so
survive<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:29.650> one<00:04:29.920> try<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.730> them<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:30.970> I

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
survive with one try is one of them so I

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.850 
survive with one try is one of them so I
did<00:04:31.180> not<00:04:31.300> get<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.600> save<00:04:32.350> at<00:04:32.500> least<00:04:32.530> two

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
did not get that save at least two

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.650 
did not get that save at least two
clones<00:04:33.160> got<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.940> then<00:04:33.970> save<00:04:34.300> four

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
clones got that and then save four

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.440 
clones got that and then save four
clones<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.920> like<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.730> you<00:04:36.970> know<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.360> not

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
clones so I like that you know it's not

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.390 
clones so I like that you know it's not
like<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:38.500> have<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.680> get<00:04:38.800> stars<00:04:39.130> or

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
like you you have to get stars or

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.440 
like you you have to get stars or
whatever<00:04:39.610> like<00:04:39.820> some<00:04:40.060> games<00:04:40.210> are<00:04:40.390> you

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
whatever like some games are you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.630 
whatever like some games are you
actually<00:04:40.720> have<00:04:40.840> missions<00:04:41.440> within<00:04:42.040> each<00:04:42.340> level

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
actually have missions within each level

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.160 
actually have missions within each level
what<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.970> which<00:04:43.240> doesn't<00:04:43.570> make<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.750> very<00:04:43.780> fun

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
what the which doesn't make it very fun

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.500 
what the which doesn't make it very fun
so<00:04:44.920> let's<00:04:45.040> go<00:04:45.130> back<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.820> menu<00:04:46.120> here<00:04:46.150> and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
so let's go back to the menu here and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.960 
so let's go back to the menu here and
let's<00:04:46.690> select<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:47.140> harder<00:04:47.590> level<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.730> think

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
let's select a harder level and I think

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.580 
let's select a harder level and I think
that<00:04:49.120> should<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.360> good<00:04:49.480> for<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.080> gameplay<00:04:50.560> I

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
that should be good for this gameplay I

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.990 
that should be good for this gameplay I
think<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:50.890> guys<00:04:51.040> will<00:04:51.190> get<00:04:51.310> an<00:04:51.430> idea<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.790> what

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
think you guys will get an idea of what

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.810 
think you guys will get an idea of what
this<00:04:52.120> game<00:04:52.330> offers<00:04:52.919> so<00:04:53.919> this<00:04:54.130> is<00:04:54.310> called<00:04:54.610> a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
this game offers so this is called a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.970 
this game offers so this is called a
super<00:04:55.150> clone<00:04:55.360> each<00:04:55.660> level<00:04:56.110> has<00:04:56.350> its<00:04:56.500> own<00:04:56.710> name

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
super clone each level has its own name

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.550 
super clone each level has its own name
which<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.310> pretty<00:04:57.490> cool<00:04:57.669> as<00:04:57.820> well<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:59.290> let's

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
which is pretty cool as well and let's

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:18.640 
which is pretty cool as well and let's
start<00:04:59.860> this<00:05:00.010> out<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.400> let's<00:05:00.550> see<00:05:00.700> how<00:05:00.820> we<00:05:00.880> do

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.480 

Wow<00:05:19.250> died<00:05:19.640> right<00:05:19.880> out<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.180> box<00:05:21.250> okay<00:05:22.250> let's

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
Wow died right out of the box okay let's

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.900 
Wow died right out of the box okay let's
try<00:05:22.580> this<00:05:22.670> again<00:05:24.220> try<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.280> do<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.520> bit<00:05:25.550> faster

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
try this again try to do it a bit faster

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.900 
try this again try to do it a bit faster
as<00:05:26.450> you<00:05:26.900> change<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.590> size<00:05:27.890> of<00:05:28.190> your<00:05:28.250> creature

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
as you change the size of your creature

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.380 
as you change the size of your creature
it<00:05:29.920> affects<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.130> physics<00:05:31.550> of<00:05:31.670> it<00:05:31.760> too<00:05:31.970> so<00:05:32.210> as

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
it affects the physics of it too so as

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.510 
it affects the physics of it too so as
it<00:05:32.540> gets<00:05:32.630> bigger<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:33.170> gets<00:05:33.290> harder<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.220> fly<00:05:34.370> it

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
it gets bigger it gets harder to fly it

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.550 
it gets bigger it gets harder to fly it
feels<00:05:35.000> much<00:05:35.270> heavier<00:05:35.660> and<00:05:35.990> there's<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.290> lot<00:05:36.530> of

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
feels much heavier and there's a lot of

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.990 
feels much heavier and there's a lot of
clones<00:05:36.830> holy<00:05:37.130> crap<00:05:37.810> as<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:40.220> get<00:05:40.370> smaller<00:05:40.730> they

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
clones holy crap as you get smaller they

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.940 
clones holy crap as you get smaller they
become<00:05:41.330> easier<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.840> fly<00:05:42.020> easier<00:05:42.560> to<00:05:42.680> maneuver

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
become easier to fly easier to maneuver

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.140 
become easier to fly easier to maneuver
but<00:05:45.950> also<00:05:46.130> as<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.610> can<00:05:46.640> see<00:05:46.760> right<00:05:46.940> there<00:05:47.120> I

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
but also as you can see right there I

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.580 
but also as you can see right there I
had<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.330> use<00:05:47.480> all<00:05:47.720> those<00:05:47.870> different<00:05:48.200> clones<00:05:48.380> to

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
had to use all those different clones to

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.890 
had to use all those different clones to
be<00:05:48.680> able<00:05:48.740> to<00:05:48.980> push<00:05:49.250> my<00:05:49.460> way<00:05:49.490> through<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:50.510> those

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
one is explode all the mines which would

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.440 
one is explode all the mines which would
really<00:06:54.590> suck<00:06:54.920> I<00:06:55.190> think<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:55.700> almost<00:06:55.850> got<00:06:56.000> em<00:06:56.180> all

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
really suck I think I almost got em all

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.440 
really suck I think I almost got em all
and<00:06:57.440> then<00:06:57.560> saved<00:06:57.920> 20<00:06:58.550> clones<00:06:58.820> and<00:06:59.150> only<00:06:59.330> got

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
and then saved 20 clones and only got

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.750 
and then saved 20 clones and only got
two<00:06:59.690> so<00:07:00.050> that<00:07:00.170> wasn't<00:07:00.350> that<00:07:00.470> great<00:07:00.590> so<00:07:00.980> I<00:07:01.670> think
