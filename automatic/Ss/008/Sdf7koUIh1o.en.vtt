00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 let's see how they work now 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.440
 search engines what is 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.570
 principle of issuing sites 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
 because not understanding this principle 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.880
 unable to promote search engine site 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.180
 system for example i'm in the search box 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.750
 index led polling montage led 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.099
 tapes for this request come first 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.640
 site appeared my site and above lenta.ru 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 which gives the answer to this query here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 these sites are higher 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.620
 they are not considered as this paid 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.070
 advertising is not a search engine 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.950
 This is an advertisement which for money 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 the owners of these sites paid therefore 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.649
 the account goes from here to here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 place on this place is my place 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.430
 website how it all happens at first I 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.059
 created a website under and laid it out 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.489
 the internet 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.809
 at first no search engine its 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 sees and gives nothing further I 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.659
 I register the site to a search engine I give 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.479
 her to understand and that a new site has appeared 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.850
 need to notice 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 further the site is visited by a robot which 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 scans the content of my articles this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.229
 content he logs in his database and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.420
 then he begins to find out 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.409
 what is this article about and what requests 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.200
 she gives the answer he sees that the article gives 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.200
 answer to the question 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.930
 mounting led strip on the ceiling 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 after that he begins to compare with 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.610
 other sites and with other articles 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.860
 which give the answer to the same 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.220
 request of everything in its base 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.869
 252 thousand responses to this query carcass I 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.890
 compete with such a huge 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.550
 number of sites 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.180
 comparing my site my answer with others 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.140
 he comes to the conclusion that my answer 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.750
 the best i give the most accurate answer to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.060
 request delivered 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.690
 the definition of the accuracy of the answer is called 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.520
 relevancy you relevance this 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.220
 response to request 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.800
 if we go down with you now 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.890
 here we see that page 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.610
 sorted by relevance by if 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.070
 speak simple language sorted by 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.020
 matching request 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.120
 website traffic to the first position mom 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.110
 there is no search engine immediately 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.730
 very long analyzes both text and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.140
 behavior of visitors on the site and in general 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.770
 cheat count 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.110
 parameters 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.180
 therefore, all this does not happen immediately 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.920
 it happens gradually so that 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.920
 So I created the site an hour later he was on 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.080
 the first place the whole procedure takes 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.720
 sometimes it takes two to three weeks 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.959
 happens as a few months search 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.470
 systems are able to determine the region I already 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.500
 told you previous lessons that here in 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.750
 It is better to promote a certain region 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.820
 your site is not tied to any 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.940
 I have a job for a certain region 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.350
 in general around the world the region can 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.610
 look here it is here region as 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.800
 rule it is determined automatically 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.190
 the system is able to determine 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.709
 your internet provider right here you are 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.340
 connected to the internet and your internet 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.500
 provider 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.989
 it is determined by the search engine and 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.700
 automatically determined region you can 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.709
 put it manually, let's for example 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.870
 let's see the results of the issue in another 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:52.010
 the region is not in Moscow I write places in Moscow 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.010
 Well, for example Tomsk, let's write the city 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.370
 Tomsk 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.900
 save find site in Tomsk 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.360
 also in first place 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.970
 that is, the search engine analyzes 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.900
 In general, all sites that are in 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.879
 all regions 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.569
 and come to the conclusion that my answer is the most 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.060
 best let's see what they think on 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:21.459
 this account other search engines 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.820
 for example google to google and website 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.789
 is in second place 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.880
 let's see what she thinks about 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.539
 my website bin as a search engine 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.699
 here the site comes first here it years 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.580
 lenta.ru 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:42.160
 thus the site ranks first 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.630
 lines that is either the first or second 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.370
 absolutely in all regions of Russia and 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.260
 absolutely in all search engines then 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.380
 have all the search engines come to 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.580
 consensus that my article is posted 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.139
 on my website gives the best answer to 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.820
 request mounting led strip on 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.860
 ceiling the conclusion is the website promotion on 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.610
 the first position comes down to 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.460
 give the most accurate and detailed answer 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.320
 delivered on request Search Engine 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.530
 this is a robot that has no brains and 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.360
 who can't read your meaning 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.169
 articles giving the meaning of what you are there 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.870
 tell me 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.159
 he operates on certain 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.400
 statistical data 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:30.729
 Our task is to learn with you to prove 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.000
 search engine that our answer is the most 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.880
 the best is the ability to give the best 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.979
 answers and the ability to prove search 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.590
 system what is it so your answer itself 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.389
 the best and dedicated to my training course and 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.810
 next we will start learning 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.150
 choose the right requests 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.729
 give answers to them and prove 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.220
 search engine what is your answer the most 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.289
 you can always master the best 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.620
 promote on the first line of the site 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.919
 absolutely any subject without spending on it 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.919
 money
