so<00:00:02.860> we<00:00:03.490> have<00:00:03.669> two<00:00:03.939> bowls<00:00:04.240> in<00:00:04.420> front<00:00:04.630> of<00:00:04.720> us<00:00:04.810> here

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.020 
so we have two bowls in front of us here

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.619 
so we have two bowls in front of us here
one<00:00:05.500> containing<00:00:05.950> brown<00:00:06.549> rice<00:00:06.879> and<00:00:07.180> the<00:00:07.480> other

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:07.629 
one containing brown rice and the other

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.049 
one containing brown rice and the other
containing<00:00:08.049> white<00:00:08.410> rice<00:00:08.680> now<00:00:09.520> which<00:00:09.820> one<00:00:10.030> of

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
containing white rice now which one of

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.060 
containing white rice now which one of
these<00:00:10.270> do<00:00:10.539> you<00:00:10.600> think<00:00:10.690> is<00:00:11.110> better<00:00:11.440> for<00:00:11.740> you<00:00:11.920> to

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
these do you think is better for you to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.119 
these do you think is better for you to
consume<00:00:12.809> you've<00:00:13.809> probably<00:00:14.049> said<00:00:14.529> the<00:00:14.920> brown

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
consume you've probably said the brown

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.140 
consume you've probably said the brown
rice<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:16.570> you<00:00:16.990> correct<00:00:17.350> actually<00:00:17.920> no<00:00:18.580> the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
rice are you correct actually no the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.880 
rice are you correct actually no the
better<00:00:19.390> wise<00:00:19.690> for<00:00:19.870> you<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:20.080> consume<00:00:20.590> is<00:00:20.770> the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
better wise for you to consume is the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.310 
better wise for you to consume is the
white<00:00:21.130> rice<00:00:21.430> we<00:00:22.240> have<00:00:22.420> an<00:00:22.540> enzyme<00:00:23.020> in<00:00:23.230> our

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
white rice we have an enzyme in our

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.410 
white rice we have an enzyme in our
saliva<00:00:23.650> which<00:00:23.950> allows<00:00:24.280> us<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.610> digest<00:00:25.030> starch

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
saliva which allows us to digest starch

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.760 
saliva which allows us to digest starch
and<00:00:25.720> white<00:00:26.050> rice<00:00:26.350> is<00:00:26.680> literally<00:00:27.400> just<00:00:27.430> starch

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
and white rice is literally just starch

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.439 
and white rice is literally just starch
obviously<00:00:29.770> it<00:00:30.039> is<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.340> starch<00:00:30.760> it's<00:00:31.270> going<00:00:31.390> to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
obviously it is a starch it's going to

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:32.970 
obviously it is a starch it's going to
turn<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.720> sugar<00:00:31.960> very<00:00:32.169> quickly<00:00:32.469> in<00:00:32.649> your<00:00:32.770> body

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
turn the sugar very quickly in your body

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.800 
turn the sugar very quickly in your body
we've<00:00:33.430> talked<00:00:33.700> a<00:00:33.850> lot<00:00:33.880> about<00:00:34.030> that<00:00:34.300> and<00:00:34.660> how

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
we've talked a lot about that and how

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.630 
we've talked a lot about that and how
that<00:00:34.989> effectively<00:00:35.620> is<00:00:35.710> just<00:00:36.010> sugar<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.460> isn't

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
that effectively is just sugar and isn't

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.100 
that effectively is just sugar and isn't
going<00:00:36.730> to<00:00:36.820> be<00:00:36.910> too<00:00:36.940> beneficial<00:00:37.570> for<00:00:37.690> body

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110

rice white rice is not going to do you
any<00:00:42.730> harm<00:00:42.820> as<00:00:43.360> long<00:00:43.570> as<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:43.780> keep<00:00:43.930> your

portion sizes down now the brown rice

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.460 
portion sizes down now the brown rice
contains<00:00:47.680> more<00:00:48.190> what<00:00:49.149> we<00:00:49.239> call<00:00:49.360> phytates<00:00:49.989> or

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
contains more what we call phytates or

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.430 
contains more what we call phytates or
the<00:00:50.649> sort<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:50.860> husk<00:00:51.070> part<00:00:51.430> of<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> rice<00:00:52.440> which

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
the sort of husk part of the rice which

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.110 
the sort of husk part of the rice which
you<00:00:53.649> might<00:00:53.920> think<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.370> better<00:00:54.579> for<00:00:54.880> you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you might think is better for you

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.729 
you might think is better for you
because<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.450> adds<00:00:55.570> more<00:00:55.809> fiber<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.500> rice

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
because it adds more fiber to the rice

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.770 
because it adds more fiber to the rice
more<00:00:57.010> roughage<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.700> means<00:00:58.270> that<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.510> release

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
more roughage and means that the release

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.030 
more roughage and means that the release
of<00:00:58.809> its<00:00:59.020> energy<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.469> slower

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
of its energy is slower

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.819 
of its energy is slower
however<00:01:00.790> it's<00:01:01.480> fairly<00:01:01.989> minimal<00:01:02.379> it's<00:01:02.530> still<00:01:02.800> a

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
however it's fairly minimal it's still a

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.369 
however it's fairly minimal it's still a
starch<00:01:03.219> and<00:01:03.610> those<00:01:04.449> phytates

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
starch and those phytates

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.129 
starch and those phytates
are<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:06.039> plants<00:01:06.490> kind<00:01:06.789> of<00:01:07.020> mechanism<00:01:08.020> of

are the plants kind of mechanism of

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:09.359 
are the plants kind of mechanism of
defending<00:01:08.590> itself<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.159> they're<00:01:09.249> actually

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
defending itself and they're actually

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.760 
defending itself and they're actually
not<00:01:09.609> fantastic<00:01:10.509> for<00:01:10.659> human<00:01:10.959> consumption<00:01:11.380> it's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
not fantastic for human consumption it's

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.739 
not fantastic for human consumption it's
very<00:01:12.009> similar<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.639> of<00:01:12.700> wheat<00:01:13.090> okay<00:01:13.689> so

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
very similar to that of wheat okay so

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.779 
very similar to that of wheat okay so
the<00:01:14.079> wheat<00:01:14.649> that<00:01:14.829> makes<00:01:15.069> flour<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.670> makes

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
the wheat that makes flour and makes

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.940 
the wheat that makes flour and makes
bread<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.240> pasta<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.659> things<00:01:16.869> like<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.079> and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
bread and pasta and things like that and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.649 
bread and pasta and things like that and
those<00:01:18.130> phytates<00:01:18.729> are<00:01:18.939> very<00:01:19.090> difficult<00:01:19.299> to

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
those phytates are very difficult to

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.840 
those phytates are very difficult to
digest<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.409> for<00:01:20.770> some<00:01:20.979> people<00:01:21.520> particularly

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
digest and for some people particularly

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.849 
digest and for some people particularly
if<00:01:22.029> you<00:01:22.090> have<00:01:22.149> an<00:01:22.389> irritable<00:01:22.779> stomach<00:01:23.319> they

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
if you have an irritable stomach they

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.889 
if you have an irritable stomach they
can<00:01:24.340> hang<00:01:24.609> around<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.240> gut<00:01:25.450> they<00:01:25.630> litter

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
can hang around in the gut they litter

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.809 
can hang around in the gut they litter
onto<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.380> sides<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:26.950> gut<00:01:27.130> wall<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.729> they

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
onto the sides of the gut wall and they

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.519 
onto the sides of the gut wall and they
can<00:01:27.969> eventually<00:01:28.240> make<00:01:28.600> little<00:01:28.840> holes<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.439> the

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:29.529 
can eventually make little holes in the

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:31.980 
can eventually make little holes in the
gut<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:29.889> then<00:01:30.159> toxins<00:01:30.700> start<00:01:30.999> to<00:01:31.149> leak<00:01:31.299> out<00:01:31.509> so

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
gut and then toxins start to leak out so

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.760 
gut and then toxins start to leak out so
you<00:01:32.619> know<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.920> possible<00:01:33.579> link<00:01:34.179> to<00:01:34.560> leaky<00:01:35.560> gut

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
you know a possible link to leaky gut

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.919 
you know a possible link to leaky gut
syndrome<00:01:36.009> or<00:01:36.399> IBS<00:01:36.639> irritable<00:01:37.149> bowel<00:01:37.689> syndrome

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
syndrome or IBS irritable bowel syndrome

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.289 
syndrome or IBS irritable bowel syndrome
certainly<00:01:38.770> if<00:01:38.829> you've<00:01:38.920> got<00:01:39.189> those<00:01:39.399> you're

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
certainly if you've got those you're

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.179 
certainly if you've got those you're
going<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> be<00:01:40.569> aggravated<00:01:41.170> by<00:01:41.200> eating<00:01:41.920> brown

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
going to be aggravated by eating brown

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.039 
going to be aggravated by eating brown
rice<00:01:42.429> or<00:01:42.639> things<00:01:42.789> that<00:01:42.939> contain<00:01:43.240> phytates

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
rice or things that contain phytates

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.319 
rice or things that contain phytates
so<00:01:44.709> the<00:01:44.829> white<00:01:45.039> rice<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.669> safer<00:01:46.029> one<00:01:46.179> to

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
so the white rice is the safer one to
