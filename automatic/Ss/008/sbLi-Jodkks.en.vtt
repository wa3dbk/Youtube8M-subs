00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990

 lawn quality 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 colorado came up but had 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.739
 difficult to penetrate the defense of the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.030
 bugre 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 tactically, it was then that the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.699
 half ariel tried improvising and did it right 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.210
 the midfielder risked the middleman and the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.260
 Goalkeeper eduardo has accepted 1 to 1 at 20 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.900

 28 minutes into play. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.439
 started with a corner kick that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.270
 finished with renan goal 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.060
 that because of technical problems 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.759
 we were able to register the first half 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.759
 so ended with bug back on the scoreboard 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.460
 in the final stage aesbe came back well and had 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.450
 one of his best performances in this 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.700
 competition 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.100
 at six o'clock juninho costa 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.560
 received a good pass but the goalkeeper keller 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.890
 He got the better avoided and the goal are 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.810
 however, in the play that began with 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.420
 a stolen ball from edson the side 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.590

 two games and the draw remained until the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.570
 complaints had a dubious bid for the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.939
