00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
comparing it to something that a machine

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
comparing it to something that a machine
that<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.790> handle<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.750> those<00:01:16.020> amount<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.460 
that can handle you know those amount of
players<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.979> expect<00:01:17.369> Xbox<00:01:18.360> 360<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
players I don't expect Xbox 360 to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.030 
players I don't expect Xbox 360 to
handle<00:01:19.860> 24<00:01:20.600> 16<00:01:21.600> players<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.409> something<00:01:22.950> like

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
handle 24 16 players or something like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.679 
handle 24 16 players or something like
that<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.430> saying<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.820> possible<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that I'm not saying it's possible but I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.219 
that I'm not saying it's possible but I
really<00:01:25.080> highly<00:01:25.890> doubt<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:28.080> why

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
something like that but I've had to say

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.930 
something like that but I've had to say
we<00:03:30.470> were<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:30.920> get<00:03:31.040> bigger<00:03:31.310> multiplayer

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
we were going to get bigger multiplayer

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.789 
we were going to get bigger multiplayer
I<00:03:32.180> would<00:03:32.599> start<00:03:32.840> off<00:03:32.930> with<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.200> range<00:03:33.470> of

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
I would start off with the range of

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.220 
I would start off with the range of
about<00:03:34.010> twelve<00:03:34.549> players<00:03:34.880> right<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:35.930> have

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
about twelve players right now we have

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.740 
about twelve players right now we have
eight<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:37.130> that's<00:03:37.250> four<00:03:37.579> let's<00:03:38.030> say<00:03:38.239> four<00:03:38.510> four

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
eight so that's four let's say four four

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.680 
eight so that's four let's say four four
so<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.410> would<00:03:39.650> be<00:03:39.799> six<00:03:40.130> six<00:03:40.459> each<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.510> that

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
so that would be six six each so that

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.180 
so that would be six six each so that
that's<00:03:41.900> what<00:03:42.169> out<00:03:42.319> that's<00:03:42.590> what<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:42.769> that's<00:03:42.980> my

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
sometimes wish for more especially when

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.860

I<00:04:10.040> do<00:04:10.160> live<00:04:10.459> streams<00:04:10.880> this<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.150> like<00:04:11.419> probably

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
I do live streams this is like probably

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.479 
I do live streams this is like probably
the<00:04:12.019> number<00:04:12.349> one<00:04:12.470> key<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:12.859> would<00:04:13.069> love<00:04:13.280> to

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
the number one key to I would love to

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.979 
the number one key to I would love to
have<00:04:13.579> bigger<00:04:13.790> multiplayer<00:04:14.329> because<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.810> can

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
have bigger multiplayer because I can

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.599 
have bigger multiplayer because I can
invite<00:04:15.260> more<00:04:15.859> than<00:04:16.099> eight<00:04:16.340> people<00:04:16.729> in

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
invite more than eight people in

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.789 
invite more than eight people in
it<00:04:17.699> would<00:04:17.819> be<00:04:17.939> absolutely<00:04:18.319> amazing<00:04:19.319> on<00:04:19.590> that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
it would be absolutely amazing on that

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.580 
it would be absolutely amazing on that
in<00:04:20.009> but<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.879> just<00:04:21.569> don't<00:04:21.750> see<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.079> coming<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.439> the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
in but I just don't see it coming in the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.129 
in but I just don't see it coming in the
near<00:04:22.830> future<00:04:23.099> but<00:04:23.490> then<00:04:23.610> again<00:04:23.729> we<00:04:23.969> just<00:04:24.330> don't

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
near future but then again we just don't

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.390 
near future but then again we just don't
know<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:25.469> hopefully<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.919> kind<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.159> cleared

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
know so hopefully it's kind of cleared

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.379 
know so hopefully it's kind of cleared
up<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.610> little<00:04:26.759> bit<00:04:26.909> on<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> bigger

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389
