we<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.079> proof<00:01:47.720> finally<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:48.899> people<00:01:49.380> came

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
we have proof finally if people came

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
we have proof finally if people came
from<00:01:49.740> animals<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.119> inherited

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
some of our behavior from them but again
