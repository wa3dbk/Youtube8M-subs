commercial sector and discover that we

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.450 
commercial sector and discover that we
actually<00:00:36.019> have<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.320> very<00:00:36.589> very<00:00:36.800> complicated

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
actually have a very very complicated

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.310 
actually have a very very complicated
regulatory<00:00:37.970> system<00:00:38.360> particularly<00:00:39.079> for

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
recreational fishers and it seemed to me

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.079 
recreational fishers and it seemed to me
that<00:00:42.350> if<00:00:42.589> you've<00:00:42.739> got<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.129> whole<00:00:43.400> heap<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.790> very

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
that if you've got a whole heap of very

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.390 
that if you've got a whole heap of very
complicated<00:00:44.659> regulations<00:00:45.409> it<00:00:45.559> makes<00:00:46.220> it

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
complicated regulations it makes it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.160 
complicated regulations it makes it
difficult<00:00:46.610> for<00:00:47.000> people<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.449> remember<00:00:47.600> them<00:00:48.019> or

red Emperor species like rank and cod

red Emperor species like rank and cod
will<00:05:11.850> go<00:05:12.090> from<00:05:12.420> two<00:05:12.720> to<00:05:13.020> three<00:05:13.070> so<00:05:14.070> there's

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
will go from two to three so there's

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.010 
will go from two to three so there's
some<00:05:14.370> real<00:05:14.580> winners<00:05:14.760> there<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.360> couple<00:05:15.900> of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
some real winners there a couple of

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.170 
some real winners there a couple of
species<00:05:16.440> like<00:05:16.650> pink<00:05:16.890> snapper<00:05:17.160> in<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.610> gas<00:05:17.970> one

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
species like pink snapper in the gas one

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.990 
species like pink snapper in the gas one
will<00:05:18.360> go<00:05:18.510> from<00:05:18.750> four<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.110> three<00:05:19.290> but<00:05:20.250> I<00:05:20.490> think

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
will go from four to three but I think

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000 
will go from four to three but I think
we've<00:05:21.120> got<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.510> right<00:05:21.720> mix<00:05:22.050> we've<00:05:22.710> listened
