very<00:01:57.579> long<00:01:57.819> ones<00:01:58.060> back<00:01:58.299> there<00:01:58.329> and<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.950> the

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
very long ones back there and for the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.679 
very long ones back there and for the
assembly<00:02:00.549> of<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.969> it<00:02:01.179> was<00:02:01.420> definitely

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
assembly of this it was definitely

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.020 
assembly of this it was definitely
assembled<00:02:02.469> with<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.649> top<00:02:02.950> stitch<00:02:03.219> I<00:02:03.460> can<00:02:03.909> see

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
assembled with a top stitch I can see

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.580 
assembled with a top stitch I can see
that<00:02:04.149> it's<00:02:04.299> stitch<00:02:04.479> multiple<00:02:04.960> times<00:02:05.170> two<00:02:05.439> or

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that it's stitch multiple times two or

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.130 
that it's stitch multiple times two or
three<00:02:05.770> times<00:02:06.039> per<00:02:06.340> seen<00:02:06.999> there<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.509> this

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
three times per seen there and this

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.840 
three times per seen there and this
course<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.590> double<00:02:08.890> bone<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.429> has<00:02:09.580> one

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
course it is double bone so it has one

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.490 
course it is double bone so it has one
bone<00:02:10.060> on<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.330> seam<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.780> one<00:02:10.960> bone<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
bone on the seam and one bone in the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.590 
bone on the seam and one bone in the
middle<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> panel<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.520> I<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.330> that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
middle of the panel and I like that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.630 
middle of the panel and I like that
better<00:02:14.020> than<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.319> having<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.280> double

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
better than just having you know double

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.820 
better than just having you know double
boned<00:02:15.850> two<00:02:16.210> bones<00:02:16.450> bondage<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.020> same<00:02:17.230> because

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
boned two bones bondage the same because

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.770 
boned two bones bondage the same because
it<00:02:18.069> seems<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.400> distribute<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.240> attention<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
it seems to distribute the attention a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.059 
it seems to distribute the attention a
little<00:02:19.990> bit<00:02:20.080> better<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.530> make<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> more

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
little bit better and make for a more

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.530
