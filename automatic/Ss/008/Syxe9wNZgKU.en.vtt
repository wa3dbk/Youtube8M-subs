00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
be pulling this part if you don't have
to<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> did<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:48.020> pulled<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> intake

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to so what I did was I pulled the intake

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.290 
to so what I did was I pulled the intake
manifold<00:00:50.160> off<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.700> changed<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> valve

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
manifold off and I changed the valve

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.049 
manifold off and I changed the valve
cover<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.770> side<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.699> access

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
cover on the side there's an access

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.990 
cover on the side there's an access
panel<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.780> are<00:00:54.809> push<00:00:55.110> rods<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> both<00:00:56.820> these

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
panel we are push rods so both these

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.959 
panel we are push rods so both these
have<00:00:57.180> new<00:00:57.449> gaskets<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.640> drove<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> for

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
have new gaskets on them I drove it for

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.840 
have new gaskets on them I drove it for
a<00:01:00.000> while<00:01:00.149> no<00:01:01.050> leaks<00:01:01.289> from<00:01:01.410> there<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.520> leak<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
a while no leaks from there the leak is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.160 
a while no leaks from there the leak is
definitely<00:01:03.239> coming<00:01:03.480> from<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> front<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
definitely coming from the front of the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
definitely coming from the front of the
engine<00:01:04.500> behind<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> water<00:01:05.100> pump

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
engine behind the water pump

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.140 
engine behind the water pump
the<00:01:05.850> timing<00:01:06.240> cover<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:08.090> that's<00:01:09.090> why<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> am<00:01:11.090> or<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the timing cover so that's why I am or I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.350 
the timing cover so that's why I am or I
have<00:01:12.650> pulled<00:01:13.650> us<00:01:13.799> apart<00:01:16.939> these<00:01:17.939> old<00:01:18.119> trucks

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
have pulled us apart these old trucks

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.580 
have pulled us apart these old trucks

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940 
lot of stuff in the way but you got to
pull<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> radiator<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

on the ground you're gonna have to take

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.679 
on the ground you're gonna have to take
the<00:01:27.570> fan<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> instructions<00:01:30.479> say<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
got to pull the water pump which I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
got to pull the water pump which I
already<00:01:46.229> pulled<00:01:46.470> there's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.549> new<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
already pulled there's a new one on the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.219 
already pulled there's a new one on the
ground<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:51.329> come<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> top<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
ground that to come on at the top is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.219 
ground that to come on at the top is
pressed<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> take<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:54.990> old<00:01:55.079> one

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
pressed in so when you take your old one

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
pressed in so when you take your old one
out<00:01:55.259> don't<00:01:55.799> bother<00:01:55.979> trying<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> old

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
out don't bother trying to get the old

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.340 
out don't bother trying to get the old
one<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.899> did

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
one out like I did

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.030 
one out like I did
thinking<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.950> threaded<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.820> not<00:02:01.040> okay

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
thinking it's threaded in it's not okay

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.959 
thinking it's threaded in it's not okay
water<00:02:02.939> pump<00:02:03.270> off<00:02:04.040> then<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> harmonic

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
water pump off then you got the harmonic

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.819 
water pump off then you got the harmonic
balancer<00:02:06.570> which<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.290> over<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
balancer which is over there on the

a polar harmonic balance polar comes off
fairly<00:02:25.910> easy<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:27.800> just<00:02:28.010> got<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.250> keep<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
fairly easy you just got to keep the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.570 
fairly easy you just got to keep the
engine<00:02:28.880> room<00:02:29.030> spinning<00:02:30.160> when<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.310> try<00:02:31.550> to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
engine room spinning when you try to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.880 
engine room spinning when you try to
take<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.060> nut<00:02:32.360> off<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.900> got<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.860> here

turns out on these 87 I love they don't

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.289 
turns out on these 87 I love they don't
know<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.950> oil<00:03:37.370> pan<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.579> actually<00:03:38.060> three

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
know that the oil pan is actually three

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.140 
know that the oil pan is actually three
pieces<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:38.989> can<00:03:39.019> see<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.790> was<00:03:40.940> three

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
pieces and you can see it was three

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.340 
pieces and you can see it was three
pieces<00:03:41.359> here<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.690> don't<00:03:41.810> know<00:03:41.930> anybody<00:03:42.170> drop

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
pieces here I don't know anybody drop

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.460 
pieces here I don't know anybody drop
one<00:03:42.560> oh<00:03:42.799> here<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.639> is<00:03:43.700> three<00:03:44.389> pieces<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:45.319> is

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
one oh here it is three pieces this is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.710 
one oh here it is three pieces this is
the<00:03:45.560> front<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.069> this<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.090> part<00:03:47.420> that's

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the front and this is a part that's

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.180 
the front and this is a part that's
going<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.019> be<00:03:48.079> jiving<00:03:48.530> with<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.739> bottom<00:03:49.040> of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
going to be jiving with the bottom of

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.319 
going to be jiving with the bottom of
your<00:03:50.560> your<00:03:51.560> timing<00:03:51.950> cover<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.940> one<00:03:53.090> that's<00:03:53.239> on

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
your your timing cover the one that's on

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.819 
your your timing cover the one that's on
there<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.540> not<00:03:53.690> too<00:03:53.840> bad<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:54.440> oil<00:03:54.620> pans

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
there is not too bad and the oil pans

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.289 
there is not too bad and the oil pans
not<00:03:55.040> leaking<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:55.579> I'm<00:03:55.730> probably<00:03:55.849> gonna<00:03:56.120> leave

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
not leaking so I'm probably gonna leave

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.720 
not leaking so I'm probably gonna leave
it<00:03:56.450> alone<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:59.750> don't<00:04:00.410> do<00:04:00.859> it<00:04:00.889> like<00:04:01.099> I<00:04:01.250> did<00:04:01.519> and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
it alone but don't do it like I did and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.580 
it alone but don't do it like I did and
buy<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:02.239> separate<00:04:03.250> oil<00:04:04.250> pan<00:04:04.579> gasket<00:04:05.389> because<00:04:05.930> if

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
buy a separate oil pan gasket because if

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.839 
buy a separate oil pan gasket because if
you're<00:04:06.709> not<00:04:06.829> going<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.099> change<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.459> oil<00:04:07.489> pan

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
you're not going to change the oil pan

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.039 
you're not going to change the oil pan
turns<00:04:08.480> out<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.530> timing<00:04:10.010> cover<00:04:10.660> kit<00:04:11.660> comes

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049
