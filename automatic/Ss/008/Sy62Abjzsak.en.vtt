warehouse.com<00:00:09.650> today<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.800> pretty<00:00:11.040> awesome

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
warehouse.com today is a pretty awesome

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.490 
warehouse.com today is a pretty awesome
day<00:00:11.639> we're<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> start<00:00:12.719> reviewing<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
day we're going to start reviewing the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.250 
day we're going to start reviewing the
FCS<00:00:14.160> two<00:00:14.670> fins<00:00:15.269> now<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.929> obviously

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
FCS two fins now these are obviously

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.099 
FCS two fins now these are obviously
made<00:00:16.590> by<00:00:16.770> FCS<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.150> new<00:00:18.390> fin<00:00:18.660> system

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
made by FCS but it's a new fin system

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.590 
made by FCS but it's a new fin system
that<00:00:19.410> screwless<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.520> these<00:00:20.670> fins<00:00:20.939> require<00:00:21.330> no

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
that screwless so these fins require no

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.050 
that screwless so these fins require no
screws<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.410> will<00:00:22.619> only<00:00:22.890> fit<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> new

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
screws and they will only fit in the new

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.019 
screws and they will only fit in the new
FCS<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.990> boxes<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> board<00:00:26.880> with

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
FCS to boxes so if you get a board with

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.570 
FCS to boxes so if you get a board with
the<00:00:27.150> FCS<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.720> boxes<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> run<00:00:28.680> any<00:00:28.920> FCS

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the FCS two boxes you can run any FCS

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.529 
the FCS two boxes you can run any FCS
two<00:00:29.849> fins

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
two fins

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
two fins
also<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.560> retro<00:00:32.009> actively<00:00:32.520> put<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.030> old

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
also you can retro actively put your old

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.490 
also you can retro actively put your old
FCS<00:00:33.840> fins<00:00:34.110> into<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.010> new<00:00:35.219> FCS<00:00:35.880> fin<00:00:36.180> system<00:00:36.899> so

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
FCS fins into the new FCS fin system so

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440 
FCS fins into the new FCS fin system so

from<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.830> fin<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> FCS<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.659> performer

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
from this fin so the FCS to performer

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.219 
from this fin so the FCS to performer
comes<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.520> PC<00:01:18.270> carbon<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.049> that's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
comes in a PC carbon now that's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.320 
comes in a PC carbon now that's
performance<00:01:19.830> core<00:01:20.159> carbon<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
performance core carbon that's what I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
performance core carbon that's what I
have<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.900> hand<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.470> off<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.460> so

now those are sold separately the PC

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190 
now those are sold separately the PC
carbon<00:01:32.430> fins<00:01:32.640> come<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> thruster<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.780> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
carbon fins come as a thruster if you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
carbon fins come as a thruster if you
want<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> turn<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.040> five<00:01:35.369> fin<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
want to turn them into a five fin or a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.300 
want to turn them into a five fin or a
quad<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.390> would<00:01:36.600> buy<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> PC<00:01:37.350> carbon<00:01:37.860> quad<00:01:38.100> or

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
quad you would buy the PC carbon quad or

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.789 
quad you would buy the PC carbon quad or
ears<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.000> closest<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> me<00:01:40.320> off<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
ears right there closest to me off to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.090 
ears right there closest to me off to
the<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:41.970> PC<00:01:42.570> carbon<00:01:43.439> performer

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the right so the PC carbon performer

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
the right so the PC carbon performer
fins<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.610> available<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.390> an<00:01:45.840> extra<00:01:46.350> small

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fins are available in an extra small

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060 
fins are available in an extra small
small<00:01:47.310> medium<00:01:47.549> large<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.780> extra<00:01:49.290> large<00:01:49.320> sizes

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
small medium large and extra large sizes

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.850 
small medium large and extra large sizes
so<00:01:50.520> FCS<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:51.990> dialing<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> their

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so FCS is really now dialing in their

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
so FCS is really now dialing in their
fins<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> variety<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.060> weight<00:01:54.479> range<00:01:54.930> or

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
fins for a variety of weight range or

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.249 
fins for a variety of weight range or
sized<00:01:56.219> surfers<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
sized surfers so you can get the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
sized surfers so you can get the
thruster<00:01:58.799> set<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.159> those<00:01:59.310> sizes<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.030> quad

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
thruster set in those sizes the quad

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
thruster set in those sizes the quad
rears<00:02:00.869> however<00:02:01.350> only<00:02:01.740> come<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.159> small

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
rears however only come in a small

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.789 
rears however only come in a small
medium<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.149> large<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> set<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.530> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
medium and large so you can set up that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.130 
medium and large so you can set up that
however<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.450> surf<00:02:06.869> style

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
however you like for your surf style

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
however you like for your surf style
with<00:02:07.439> those<00:02:07.619> different<00:02:08.039> size<00:02:08.220> fronts<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
with those different size fronts and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.440 
with those different size fronts and
quad<00:02:09.360> rears<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.400> thing<00:02:11.670> about<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
quad rears so the thing about the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.220 
quad rears so the thing about the
perform

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
perform

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.410 
perform
before<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.920> into<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.370> other<00:02:14.610> materials<00:02:15.270> is

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
before I get into the other materials is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.690 
before I get into the other materials is
that<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> thruster<00:02:16.530> set<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.950> an<00:02:17.099> all-around

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that the thruster set is an all-around

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.720 
that the thruster set is an all-around
set<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.269> fins<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.870> inside<00:02:19.560> foil<00:02:20.010> technology

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
set of fins with inside foil technology

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
set of fins with inside foil technology
now<00:02:20.970> these<00:02:21.450> fins<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.930> designed<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.980> great

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
now these fins are designed to be great

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.400 
now these fins are designed to be great
for<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.550> variety<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.330> wave<00:02:24.510> conditions<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
for a variety of a wave conditions and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.320 
for a variety of a wave conditions and
boards<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.519> really<00:02:26.670> want<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.060> go<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
boards so if you really want to go to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
boards so if you really want to go to
fin<00:02:27.989> that's<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.980> performer<00:02:29.519> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
fin that's what the performer is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.020 
fin that's what the performer is
therefore<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.750> performance<00:02:31.430> core<00:02:32.430> carbon

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
therefore the performance core carbon

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.490 
therefore the performance core carbon
material<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.050> be<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.319> most

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
material is going to be the most

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.110 
material is going to be the most
high-end<00:02:34.800> material<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> performer

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
high-end material that the performer

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
high-end material that the performer
comes<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.630> now<00:02:37.110> you're<00:02:37.260> gonna<00:02:37.440> see<00:02:37.739> that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
comes in now you're gonna see that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130 
comes in now you're gonna see that
carbon<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> base<00:02:39.120> as<00:02:39.390> well<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
carbon there at the base as well as the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.740 
carbon there at the base as well as the
strips<00:02:40.709> through<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.459> top<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> fin<00:02:42.239> now

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
strips through to the top of the fin now

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.600 
strips through to the top of the fin now
that's<00:02:43.019> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.260> make<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.830> particular<00:02:44.099> set

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that's going to make this particular set

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.020 
that's going to make this particular set
of<00:02:44.640> fins<00:02:44.940> flex<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.230> most<00:02:46.620> beneficial<00:02:47.610> flex

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
of fins flex in the most beneficial flex

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.050 
of fins flex in the most beneficial flex

no<00:03:11.610> quad<00:03:12.000> rears<00:03:12.390> there<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.170> could<00:03:13.380> turn

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
no quad rears there but you could turn

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.380 
no quad rears there but you could turn
them<00:03:13.799> into<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.099> quarter<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.790> five<00:03:15.000> fin<00:03:15.209> you

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.720 
them into a quarter of five fin you
would<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.079> use<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.470> PC<00:03:16.769> carbon

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
would just have to use the PC carbon

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.000 
would just have to use the PC carbon
rears<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.329> then<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> also<00:03:19.079> have<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.680> glass

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
rears and then you also have the glass

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.460 
rears and then you also have the glass
flex<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> medium<00:03:21.870> quad<00:03:22.170> rear

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
flex and there is a medium quad rear

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.440 
flex and there is a medium quad rear
available<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> glass<00:03:23.609> flex<00:03:23.940> material

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
available in the glass flex material

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.699 
available in the glass flex material
you're<00:03:24.840> not<00:03:25.019> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.260> see<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
you're not going to see that on the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.830 
you're not going to see that on the
table<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.130> front<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.459> me<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:26.910> do<00:03:27.150> have<00:03:27.480> them

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
table in front of me but we do have them

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.800 
table in front of me but we do have them
so<00:03:28.709> that's<00:03:28.889> how<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.220> would<00:03:29.459> run<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.970> glass

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
so that's how you would run the glass

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.500 
so that's how you would run the glass
flex<00:03:31.139> as<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.650> quad<00:03:31.920> or<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.250> five<00:03:32.639> fin<00:03:32.940> now<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
flex as a quad or a five fin now the
