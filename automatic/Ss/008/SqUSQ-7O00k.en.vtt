Springbok<00:01:41.100> attack<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.729> play<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.390> me<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> always

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
Springbok attack a play like me I always

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so make a lot of mistakes but sometimes

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.670 
so make a lot of mistakes but sometimes
it<00:01:47.460> pays<00:01:47.610> off<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.659> small<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
it pays off you small you have to use it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
it pays off you small you have to use it
that<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.189> can't<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.670> can't<00:01:50.909> change

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that so you just have to train order be

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
that so you just have to train order be

smarter than the other guys I would say

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
smarter than the other guys I would say
I've<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.500> bigger<00:01:55.680> guys<00:01:55.890> running<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.340> TGC

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
just try running around and we'll just

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.880 
just try running around and we'll just
chop<00:02:02.189> over<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.790> are<00:02:03.090> there's<00:02:03.299> lots<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> ways<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
chop over so are there's lots of ways to

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.770 
chop over so are there's lots of ways to
lots<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.979> ways<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> kill<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.460> cat

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.210 

growing<00:02:08.780> up<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.020> was<00:02:09.140> never<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.500> fastest<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.070> was

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
growing up I was never the fastest I was

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.890 
growing up I was never the fastest I was
just<00:02:10.460> I<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:10.880> I've<00:02:11.180> always<00:02:11.450> came<00:02:11.660> third

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
just I think I've always came third

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.170 
just I think I've always came third
fourth<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.500> was<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.460> around<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.850> Middle's

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
fourth so I was just around the Middle's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.630 
fourth so I was just around the Middle's
or<00:02:14.360> not<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.050> uh<00:02:15.080> yeah<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.800> don't<00:02:15.980> know<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.430> got

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
or not so but uh yeah I don't know I got

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280 
or not so but uh yeah I don't know I got
a<00:02:16.670> bit<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.940> speed<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.420> got<00:02:17.570> older<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.080> it's

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
a bit of speed when I got older so it's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.110 
a bit of speed when I got older so it's
it's<00:02:18.560> good<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:21.520> every<00:02:22.520> time<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
it's good to have every time I get the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.550 
it's good to have every time I get the
ball<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.300> think<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.720> people<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.200> I'm<00:02:24.380> going

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
ball I think that people think I'm going

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.080 
ball I think that people think I'm going
to<00:02:24.710> do<00:02:24.830> something<00:02:25.100> amazing<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:25.820> in<00:02:26.000> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
to do something amazing but in the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.310 
to do something amazing but in the
national<00:02:26.450> rugby<00:02:26.600> doesn't<00:02:27.020> look<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.290> that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
national rugby doesn't look like that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.000 
national rugby doesn't look like that
anymore

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
anymore

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.190 
anymore
because<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.640> guys<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.390> study<00:02:29.630> either<00:02:29.900> now

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
because the guys can study either now

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.960 
because the guys can study either now
you<00:02:30.260> play<00:02:30.680> they<00:02:30.830> know<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.250> do<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.760> it's

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
you play they know what you do so it's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.030 
you play they know what you do so it's
it's<00:02:32.270> becoming<00:02:33.080> more<00:02:33.260> difficult<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.860> play
