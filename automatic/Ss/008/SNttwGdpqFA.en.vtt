okay big smudge stick you can pull that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.770 
okay big smudge stick you can pull that
apart<00:02:34.750> as<00:02:34.990> well<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.270> why<00:02:37.270> would<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.480> want<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
buy a smudge stick then if it's if it's

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.830 
buy a smudge stick then if it's if it's
handy<00:02:39.520> or<00:02:39.580> by<00:02:39.700> burning<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.240> smaller<00:02:40.510> parts

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
handy or by burning in smaller parts

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.970 
handy or by burning in smaller parts
well<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> little<00:02:41.830> bit<00:02:41.980> more<00:02:42.130> economical

apart here you will get your bit ping

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.290 
apart here you will get your bit ping
off<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:49.960> happen<00:02:50.260> there<00:02:50.520> but<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:52.180> get

off like just happen there but you get
little<00:02:52.510> usable<00:02:53.020> pieces<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:55.660> trim

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
little usable pieces and I I can trim

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.060 
little usable pieces and I I can trim
the<00:02:55.930> last<00:02:56.080> time<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.290> used<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.470> big<00:02:56.590> one<00:02:56.739> but<00:02:56.920> you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
the last time I used a big one but you

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.630 
the last time I used a big one but you
know<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:57.550> kind<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:59.100> you<00:03:00.100> know<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.280> get<00:03:00.520> lots

know it's kind of you know you get lots
of<00:03:00.760> small<00:03:00.970> pieces<00:03:01.120> there<00:03:01.480> then<00:03:02.170> compare<00:03:02.590> this

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
of small pieces there then compare this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.840 
of small pieces there then compare this
to<00:03:03.760> something<00:03:03.790> like<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.660> desert<00:03:05.230> sage<00:03:05.410> here<00:03:05.950> so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
to something like a desert sage here so

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.820 
to something like a desert sage here so
desert<00:03:07.330> sage<00:03:07.480> doesn't<00:03:07.840> catch<00:03:08.200> quite<00:03:08.530> as<00:03:08.650> well

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
desert sage doesn't catch quite as well

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.170 
desert sage doesn't catch quite as well
I'll<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.190> burn<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:09.820> at<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> end<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.600> I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
I'll just burn this at the end here I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.620 
I'll just burn this at the end here I
hope<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.300> can<00:03:13.420> still<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.810> me<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:16.090> if<00:03:16.180> I'm<00:03:16.300> if

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
I'm trying to burn desert sage it does

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.890
