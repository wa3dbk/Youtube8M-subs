 well here at the desk what 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.750
 first thing we have to do is where 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.420
 they get the internet signal 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 then to open center of networks and resources 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.190
 shared 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.190
 we wait for him to load 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.149
 then in setting up a new connection or 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.149
 net 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.380
 we go down and we give 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.900
 and in which he has lied 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.430
 in setting up a wireless network of 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.680
