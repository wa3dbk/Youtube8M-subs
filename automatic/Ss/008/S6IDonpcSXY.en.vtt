of the features that the DC 8 camera
offers<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.689> an<00:00:18.869> 8<00:00:18.989> megapixel<00:00:19.590> camera<00:00:19.730> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
offers it's an 8 megapixel camera it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.030 
offers it's an 8 megapixel camera it
does<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.540> large<00:00:22.250> 2.7<00:00:23.250> LDC<00:00:24.000> screen<00:00:24.329> display

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
does have a large 2.7 LDC screen display

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.389 
does have a large 2.7 LDC screen display
so<00:00:26.040> you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.489> see<00:00:26.880> your<00:00:27.060> pictures<00:00:27.450> clearly

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
so you can see your pictures clearly

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.150 
so you can see your pictures clearly
when<00:00:29.399> you're<00:00:29.520> taking<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.210> underwater<00:00:31.160> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
when you're taking them underwater it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.939 
when you're taking them underwater it
also<00:00:32.340> has<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> built<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.030> wide-angle<00:00:33.660> lens<00:00:33.949> so

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
also has a built in wide-angle lens so

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.029 
also has a built in wide-angle lens so
basically<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:36.379> get<00:00:37.379> closer<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.949> your

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
basically you can get closer to your

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.669 
basically you can get closer to your
subject<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.699> keep<00:00:39.539> more<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.019> subject<00:00:40.559> in

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
subject and keep more of your subject in

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.939 
subject and keep more of your subject in
the<00:00:40.829> frame<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:42.839> has<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.559> fastest

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
the frame it also has one of the fastest

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.910 
the frame it also has one of the fastest
shutter<00:00:44.399> response<00:00:45.000> times<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.589> you<00:00:46.710> take

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
shutter response times so when you take

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.349 
shutter response times so when you take
your<00:00:47.070> picture<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.149> less<00:00:48.539> delay<00:00:48.929> in<00:00:50.359> the

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
your picture you have less delay in the

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.329 
your picture you have less delay in the
when<00:00:52.109> you<00:00:52.199> click<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.589> button<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
when you click the button in when the

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.229 
when you click the button in when the
camera<00:00:54.089> takes<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> picture<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:56.100> also<00:00:56.280> has<00:00:56.609> a<00:00:56.909> C

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
camera takes the picture it also has a C

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
camera takes the picture it also has a C
mode<00:00:57.480> when<00:00:58.079> you're<00:00:58.170> underwater<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.920> helps

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
mode when you're underwater that helps

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.910 
mode when you're underwater that helps
boost<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.640> color<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.409> underwater<00:01:01.409> pictures

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
boost the color of underwater pictures

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.479 
boost the color of underwater pictures
so<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.819> depth<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> lose<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.430> on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so at depth as you know you lose out on

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.289 
so at depth as you know you lose out on
color<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.509> this<00:01:06.720> mode<00:01:07.649> in<00:01:07.950> place<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.149> can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
color with this mode in place you can

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
color with this mode in place you can
dive<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.869> deeper<00:01:10.380> depth<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.950> still<00:01:11.189> keep<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
dive to deeper depth and still keep the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.410 
dive to deeper depth and still keep the
rich<00:01:11.880> richness<00:01:12.720> color<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.119> at

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
rich richness color that you see at

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.130 
rich richness color that you see at
depth<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:17.220> also<00:01:17.399> has<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.119> built<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.630> 32

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
depth it also has a built in 32

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.010 
depth it also has a built in 32
megapixel<00:01:19.799> built<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.490> memory<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
megapixel built in memory but you can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.399 
megapixel built in memory but you can
also<00:01:22.229> upgrade<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.329> up<00:01:24.329> to<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.960> 8<00:01:25.140> gigabyte

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
also upgrade that to up to an 8 gigabyte
