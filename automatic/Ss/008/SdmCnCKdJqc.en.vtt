difficult to move on underperforming
teachers<00:00:35.219> too<00:00:35.670> bureaucratic<00:00:36.140> sometimes<00:00:37.140> too

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
teachers too bureaucratic sometimes too

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
teachers too bureaucratic sometimes too
confrontational<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.879> also<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> case

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
confrontational and it's also the case

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that a majority of teachers have also

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.369 
that a majority of teachers have also
said<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.190> me<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:42.020> just<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.350> two

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
said to me but just one or two

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
said to me but just one or two
underperforming<00:00:44.219> teachers<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:45.180> make<00:00:45.210> life

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
underperforming teachers can make life

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.760 
underperforming teachers can make life
more<00:00:45.690> difficult<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.170> everyone<00:00:46.379> else<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
more difficult for everyone else in the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.950 
more difficult for everyone else in the
staff<00:00:46.980> room<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> thought<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.390> right<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
staff room so I thought it was right to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.930 
staff room so I thought it was right to
shorten<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> procedure<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.489> make<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> less

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
shorten the procedure to make it less

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
shorten the procedure to make it less
confrontational<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:52.199> make<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.530> direct

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
confrontational to make it more direct

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160 
confrontational to make it more direct
so<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.820> those<00:00:53.969> teachers<00:00:54.210> who<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.809> improve

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so that those teachers who can improve

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
so that those teachers who can improve
with<00:00:55.500> support<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.039> help<00:00:56.250> who<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.239> whatever

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
with support and help who for whatever

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
with support and help who for whatever
reason<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.780> been<00:00:57.930> underperforming<00:00:58.219> can<00:00:59.219> be

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
reason have been underperforming can be

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
reason have been underperforming can be
supported<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> improve<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.320> those

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
supported to improve and then those

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
supported to improve and then those
teachers<00:01:01.920> who<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.600> moved<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> they

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
teachers who do need to be moved on they

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.649 
teachers who do need to be moved on they
can<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.769> moved<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> minimum<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.330> fuss

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
can be moved on with a minimum of fuss

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.200 
can be moved on with a minimum of fuss
and<00:01:07.049> bother<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.799> everyone<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.060> then

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.399 
improve the performance of the school
but<00:01:31.350> nothing<00:01:31.860> had<00:01:32.100> been<00:01:32.400> sustainable

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
but nothing had been sustainable

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.270 
but nothing had been sustainable
children<00:01:34.409> were<00:01:34.470> being<00:01:34.650> exposed<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
children were being exposed to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
children were being exposed to
inadequate<00:01:35.610> teaching<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> day<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> day

inadequate teaching on a day to day

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.069 
inadequate teaching on a day to day
basis<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.549> had<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> start<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.420> being<00:01:39.869> able

basis so we had to start off being able

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.889 
basis so we had to start off being able
to<00:01:40.700> for<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.729> head<00:01:41.939> teacher<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.630> able<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.889 
to for the head teacher to be able to
lead<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.590> say<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.670> most<00:01:44.939> important<00:01:45.450> task<00:01:45.689> is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
lead and say my most important task is

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
lead and say my most important task is
to<00:01:46.020> improve<00:01:46.380> teaching<00:01:46.649> I'm<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> show

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to improve teaching I'm going to show

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.170 
to improve teaching I'm going to show
you<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> teach<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.979> lesson<00:01:50.040> every<00:01:51.000> day

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you how to teach a good lesson every day

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690 
you how to teach a good lesson every day
so<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.960> implemented<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.530> teaching<00:01:52.950> rubric<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so we implemented a teaching rubric that

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.440 
so we implemented a teaching rubric that
allows<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.810> enables<00:01:55.229> people<00:01:56.009> who<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:57.149> step

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
allows and enables people who can step

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.270 
allows and enables people who can step
up<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> plate<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.680> able<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.979> deliver

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
up to the plate to be able to deliver

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120 
up to the plate to be able to deliver
effective<00:01:59.939> lessons<00:02:00.500> what<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.740> government

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
effective lessons what the government

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.300 
effective lessons what the government
has<00:02:02.250> done<00:02:02.280> today<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.600> remove<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
has done today is to remove some of the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.969 
has done today is to remove some of the
complexities<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.970> original<00:02:09.509> procedure

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
complexities of the original procedure

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.410 
complexities of the original procedure
so<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> think<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.370> simplification

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
so I think the simplification

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.570 
so I think the simplification
allows<00:02:12.780> people<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.980> their<00:02:14.190> governing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
allows people with their governing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.400 
allows people with their governing
bodies<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.240> with<00:02:15.420> their<00:02:15.630> Human<00:02:15.959> Resources

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
bodies and with their Human Resources

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.660 
bodies and with their Human Resources
advisers<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.459> be<00:02:17.580> able<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.940> structure<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.959> much

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
advisers to be able to structure a much

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.390 
advisers to be able to structure a much
clearer<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.000> quicker<00:02:21.720> process<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:23.069> allows

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
clearer and quicker process that allows

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400 
clearer and quicker process that allows
headteachers<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> believe<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:25.349> can

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
headteachers to believe that they can

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
headteachers to believe that they can
start<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> process<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.239> through<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
start the process and get through to the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.229 
start the process and get through to the
end<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.470> what<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.700> sympathetic

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
end in what is not just a sympathetic

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.530 
end in what is not just a sympathetic
but<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.140> professional<00:02:31.950> management<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.940> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
but a professional management of that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
but a professional management of that
inadequate<00:02:34.140> teaching<00:02:34.590> when<00:02:35.280> Amanda<00:02:35.520> arrived

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
inadequate teaching when Amanda arrived

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.210 
inadequate teaching when Amanda arrived
she<00:02:36.750> made<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.959> very<00:02:36.989> clear<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.440> teaching<00:02:38.069> and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
she made it very clear that teaching and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.770 
she made it very clear that teaching and
learning<00:02:38.610> was<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> priority<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
learning was a priority and that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.440 
learning was a priority and that
standards<00:02:40.739> had<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.069> improved

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
standards had to be improved

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
standards had to be improved
she<00:02:43.050> introduced<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.739> rubric<00:02:44.190> which<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:44.760> had<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
she introduced a rubric which we had to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.750 
she introduced a rubric which we had to
follow<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.530> any<00:02:46.860> previous<00:02:47.370> teaching

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
follow so any previous teaching

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.509 
follow so any previous teaching
strategies<00:02:48.269> were<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.650> used<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.250> we

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
strategies were not to be used and we

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.490 
strategies were not to be used and we
have<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> follow<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.180> clear<00:02:51.720> format<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
have to follow this clear format and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.740 
have to follow this clear format and
based<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.130> less<00:02:53.549> teacher<00:02:53.910> talk<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.569> more

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
based on less teacher talk but more

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.289 
based on less teacher talk but more
child<00:02:55.350> participation<00:02:56.250> where<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.060> teacher

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
child participation where the teacher

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.900 
child participation where the teacher
models<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.230> then<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> child<00:02:59.190> practices<00:02:59.730> and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
models and then the child practices and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.910 
models and then the child practices and
you<00:02:59.970> do<00:03:00.120> repeat<00:03:00.569> that<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.440> make<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
you do repeat that and you make it you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.380 
you do repeat that and you make it you
know<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.400> assessing<00:03:02.790> throughout<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
know and you're assessing throughout the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.350 
know and you're assessing throughout the
whole<00:03:03.540> lesson<00:03:04.549> with<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.700> children<00:03:06.150> being

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
whole lesson with the children being

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.720 
whole lesson with the children being
more<00:03:06.950> active<00:03:07.950> participants<00:03:08.459> they<00:03:08.640> have

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
more active participants they have

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.490 
more active participants they have
become<00:03:09.000> active<00:03:09.209> learners<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.350> what

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
become active learners and that is what

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.150 
become active learners and that is what
we<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:10.709> want

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
we really want

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.340 
we really want
because<00:03:11.549> when<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.790> children<00:03:12.000> are<00:03:12.330> active<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
because when the children are active and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.559 
because when the children are active and
not<00:03:13.470> passive<00:03:13.500> they<00:03:14.130> learn<00:03:14.340> far<00:03:14.640> more<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.150> you

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
not passive they learn far more and you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.940 
not passive they learn far more and you
can<00:03:15.720> actually<00:03:15.840> see<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> progress<00:03:16.470> throughout

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
can actually see the progress throughout

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.800 
can actually see the progress throughout
the<00:03:17.100> whole<00:03:17.250> lesson<00:03:17.450> nothing<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.630> more

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
the whole lesson nothing is more

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.110 
the whole lesson nothing is more
important<00:03:19.350> than<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.190> interaction<00:03:20.940> between

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
important than the interaction between

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.080 
important than the interaction between
students<00:03:22.079> and<00:03:22.200> teachers<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.640> know<00:03:23.850> from

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
students and teachers and we know from

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.599 
students and teachers and we know from
academic<00:03:24.600> studies<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.799> quality<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.549> a

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
academic studies that the quality of a

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.090 
academic studies that the quality of a
teacher<00:03:26.820> can<00:03:27.570> make<00:03:27.930> an<00:03:28.170> enormous<00:03:28.709> amount<00:03:28.950> of

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
teacher can make an enormous amount of

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.550 
teacher can make an enormous amount of
difference<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.030> child's<00:03:30.359> progress<00:03:30.560> nothing

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
difference to a child's progress nothing

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.330 
difference to a child's progress nothing
matters<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.810> but<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.900> also<00:03:34.140> know<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:35.190> there

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
matters more but we also know that there

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.460 
matters more but we also know that there
are<00:03:35.459> some<00:03:35.760> teachers<00:03:36.060> who<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.840> not<00:03:36.870> adding

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
are some teachers who are not adding

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.920 
are some teachers who are not adding
value<00:03:37.500> for<00:03:38.280> not<00:03:38.459> inspiring<00:03:38.910> who<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.750> whatever

value for not inspiring who for whatever

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.860

reason are not in the right profession

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.740 
reason are not in the right profession
and<00:03:43.769> we<00:03:43.890> need<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> tackle<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.730> issue<00:03:44.970> because

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and we need to tackle that issue because
