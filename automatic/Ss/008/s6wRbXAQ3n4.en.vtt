get<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.610> second<00:01:10.540> platform<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:12.369> light<00:01:14.520> two

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
get to the second platform on light two

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.690 
get to the second platform on light two
of<00:01:15.910> six<00:01:16.360> paths<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.050> sir<00:01:17.259> separate<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.460> even

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
of six paths so sir separate and even

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.020 
of six paths so sir separate and even
then<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:19.030> pretty<00:01:19.270> hard<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:21.100> just<00:01:21.520> takes<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
then it's pretty hard so it just takes a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.210 
then it's pretty hard so it just takes a
long<00:01:22.210> time<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.710> up<00:01:23.770> instantly

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
long time to do and it up instantly

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.040 
long time to do and it up instantly
all<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.000> means<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:25.540> have<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.780> do<00:01:25.930> it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
all that means is you have to do it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.719 
all that means is you have to do it
again

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.100 

and<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.900> only<00:01:34.020> enemies<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:36.110> less

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and the only enemies in there are less

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.920 
and the only enemies in there are less
the<00:01:37.350> excel<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.510> it's<00:01:39.510> not<00:01:39.690> dangerous

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the excel is just it's not dangerous

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
the excel is just it's not dangerous
just<00:01:40.409> annoyed<00:01:41.900> now<00:01:42.900> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.220> think

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
just annoyed now this is this is I think

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.390 
just annoyed now this is this is I think
the<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> most<00:01:45.979> Megaman<00:01:46.979> games<00:01:47.220> should

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
the way that most Megaman games should

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.870 
the way that most Megaman games should
be<00:01:47.580> where<00:01:48.530> until<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.800> here<00:01:50.070> down<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
be where until we get here down with the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.600 
be where until we get here down with the
a<00:01:50.910> Mega<00:01:51.270> Man<00:01:51.450> 1<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:52.259> exactly<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.070> mean<00:01:53.280> yeah

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
awesome once you have it the game isn't

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.620 
awesome once you have it the game isn't
i<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> other<00:02:16.680> hand<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:18.120> also<00:02:18.300> makes

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
i but on the other hand that also makes

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.280 
i but on the other hand that also makes
a<00:02:18.870> lot<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.080> level<00:02:19.620> design<00:02:21.260> sort<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.610> disappear

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
a lot of level design sort of disappear

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.390 
a lot of level design sort of disappear
so<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:26.430> sort<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:28.440> its<00:02:28.560> point<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:29.010> actually

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so it's sort of to its point to actually

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.090 
so it's sort of to its point to actually
play

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
play

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
section I i cleared through i really

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.970 
section I i cleared through i really
should<00:04:15.870> have<00:04:15.930> talked<00:04:16.260> about<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.769> because

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
should have talked about that because

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.240 
should have talked about that because
it's<00:04:17.639> what<00:04:17.880> makes<00:04:18.660> me<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.230> two-stage<00:04:19.709> this

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
one's not that bad because the killer

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.510 
one's not that bad because the killer
the<00:04:24.540> rising<00:04:25.020> section<00:04:25.440> would<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.400> been

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the rising section would have been

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.690 
the rising section would have been
really<00:04:26.880> cool<00:04:27.330> if<00:04:27.810> hadn't<00:04:28.470> been<00:04:28.650> for<00:04:29.070> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
really cool if hadn't been for the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.150 
really cool if hadn't been for the
 bombs<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:32.100> fun<00:04:32.370> moments<00:04:32.940> because

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160
