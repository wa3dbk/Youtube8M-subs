that makes arcade machines into the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.860 
that makes arcade machines into the
ground<00:03:37.920> no<00:03:38.310> what's<00:03:38.489> crazy<00:03:38.580> about<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.330> is<00:03:39.750> the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
though we had space in previous homes it

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.330 
though we had space in previous homes it
was<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:37.960> were<00:04:38.080> like<00:04:38.229> motivated<00:04:38.979> for<00:04:39.130> some

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
was we were like motivated for some

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.100 
was we were like motivated for some
reason<00:04:39.639> that<00:04:39.729> was<00:04:39.849> a<00:04:39.880> little<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.330> little<00:04:40.720> weird

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
reason that was a little a little weird

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.499 
reason that was a little a little weird
how<00:04:41.289> motivated<00:04:41.949> we<00:04:42.130> were<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.669> can't<00:04:43.120> help

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
how motivated we were and I can't help

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.050 
how motivated we were and I can't help
but<00:04:43.750> think<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.259> it<00:04:45.099> had<00:04:45.250> something<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.789> do

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
but think that it had something to do

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.600 
but think that it had something to do
with<00:04:46.360> all<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.110> dead<00:04:47.380> arcade<00:04:47.830> machines<00:04:48.340> in

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
with all of the dead arcade machines in

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.779 
with all of the dead arcade machines in
the<00:04:48.880> ground<00:04:49.180> below<00:04:49.750> us<00:04:49.960> telling<00:04:50.410> us<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.800> revive

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
the ground below us telling us to revive

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.629 
the ground below us telling us to revive
us<00:04:51.819> bring<00:04:52.810> back<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.319> arcades<00:04:53.770> don't<00:04:54.250> let<00:04:54.520> us

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
us bring back the arcades don't let us

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.150 
us bring back the arcades don't let us
die<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.330> don't<00:04:55.780> let<00:04:55.990> history<00:04:56.259> take<00:04:56.560> itself

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
die and don't let history take itself

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.800 
die and don't let history take itself
down<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.430> path<00:04:57.849> where<00:04:58.180> it'll<00:04:58.630> eventually

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
down a path where it'll eventually

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.529 
down a path where it'll eventually
become<00:04:59.380> completely<00:04:59.860> irrelevant<00:05:00.240> preserve<00:05:01.240> us

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
become completely irrelevant preserve us

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.320 
become completely irrelevant preserve us
and<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:02.349> it's<00:05:03.039> it's<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.490> little<00:05:03.729> creepy<00:05:03.940> right

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
and I it's it's a little creepy right

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.850 
and I it's it's a little creepy right
it's<00:05:04.539> even<00:05:04.630> it's<00:05:04.960> even<00:05:05.199> more<00:05:05.349> creepy<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.830> think

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
it's even it's even more creepy to think

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.920 
it's even it's even more creepy to think
that<00:05:06.130> I'm<00:05:06.340> probably<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.909> only<00:05:07.120> person<00:05:07.330> within

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
that I'm probably the only person within

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.409 
that I'm probably the only person within
a<00:05:08.259> several<00:05:08.919> block<00:05:09.159> radius<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.849> has<00:05:10.000> anything

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
a several block radius that has anything

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.749 
a several block radius that has anything
close<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.720> an<00:05:10.960> arcade<00:05:11.259> cabinet<00:05:11.770> in<00:05:11.919> their

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
close to an arcade cabinet in their

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.839 
close to an arcade cabinet in their
garage<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.650> below<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:15.099> probably<00:05:15.610> the

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
garage and below it is probably the

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.260 
garage and below it is probably the
remnants<00:05:16.419> of<00:05:16.449> fallen<00:05:17.259> arcade<00:05:17.919> machines<00:05:18.430> so
