00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 at the arrival of spring bikers 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.510
 many are on the road 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.250
 sinuous but after a long 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.040
 winter motorcycle at the garage 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.650
 we must relearn the good reflexes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 this is the goal of these courses since 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.600
 five years stop an internship when 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.760
 program at the beginning of the season since in 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.560
 high-savoie coiled so to speak not 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.980
 winter and put back the bikers on the saddle 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.710
 for them to approach the new season 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.440
 in the best conditions 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 the second goal is the target of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.260
 young bikers young not in age but in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 seniority of license two hundred and forty 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.660
 volunteers we participate in these courses 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.329
 this year in this group all these are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.610
 two young motorcyclists in turn they 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.410
 roll followed closely by a policeman 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.410
 then comes the time of the balance sheet 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.310
 philippe has passed his license at least 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.530
 last november 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.940
 but since he did not feel 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.750
 really safe 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.520
 the practical side is not so advanced 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.550
 during the license actually made a lot 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 of plateau and that's the maneuverability to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 low speed and and that's true 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.909
 is really in the traffic and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.130
 and in the path of the road the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.020
 safety trajectories the day gets 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.240
 continues for bikers a few 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.939
 kilometers away to contamine serves a 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.320
 for the workshops that of the 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.810
 maneuverability of the bike is 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.909
 particularly delicate even for 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.189
 more experienced 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.079
 last year the 12 bikers killed in 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.170
 high savoy were mostly elderly 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.750
 25 to 39 years old in 2011 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.000
 most were over 40 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.649
 a lot of people who pick up on motorcycles 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.810
 many have practiced the motorcycle being more 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.860
 young a lot come back when the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.060
 children are a little bigger 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.789
 they come back to their first love 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.039
 to the bike and they spent ten fifteen 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.329
 twenty years in practice so these are 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.039
 days to pick up the vouchers at 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.530
 above good notions of beauce good 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.539
 reflexes take up the fundamentals of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.780
 driving motorcyclists them 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.099
 organizers of these courses trajectory 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.980
 looking for ways to raise awareness 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.549
 more bikers beyond these 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.099
 volunteers 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.079
 it must be said that all remain 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.989
 vulnerable users on the road 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.690
 the bikers represent a third of 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.359
 killed and a quarter of the casualties for 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.359
 only 4% of road traffic
