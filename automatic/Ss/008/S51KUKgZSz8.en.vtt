what<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.490> x-axis<00:02:01.119> is<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.599> to<00:02:01.689> control

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
what the x-axis is is going to control

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.589 
what the x-axis is is going to control
this<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.799> going<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.039> control<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:04.029> left<00:02:04.329> and

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
this is going to control the left and

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.830 
this is going to control the left and
right<00:02:04.810> push<00:02:05.139> of<00:02:05.349> the<00:02:05.469> joystick<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.969> my<00:02:07.240> case<00:02:07.509> I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
right push of the joystick in my case I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.090 
right push of the joystick in my case I
use<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.700> roll<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:11.230> when<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.710> push<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
use this to roll so when you push the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.680 
use this to roll so when you push the
joystick<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.790> left<00:02:13.000> it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
joystick to the left it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.330 
joystick to the left it
rolls<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.050> helicopter<00:02:14.590> towards<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> left

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
rolls the helicopter towards the left

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.790 
rolls the helicopter towards the left
and<00:02:15.520> vice<00:02:15.940> versa<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> first<00:02:17.410> thing<00:02:17.650> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
and vice versa so the first thing that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.740 
and vice versa so the first thing that
you<00:02:17.920> want<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.160> look<00:02:18.280> at<00:02:18.490> here<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.940> how<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.570> got

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you want to look at here is how it's got

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.350 
you want to look at here is how it's got
three<00:02:20.200> separate<00:02:20.650> setups<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:21.670> got<00:02:21.880> zero<00:02:21.910> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
three separate setups it's got zero to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.780 
three separate setups it's got zero to

33 33 to 67 67 to 100 these three bands

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
33 33 to 67 67 to 100 these three bands
are<00:02:28.000> very<00:02:28.030> important<00:02:28.750> your<00:02:29.200> first<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.710> is

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
are very important your first one is

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.460 
are very important your first one is
