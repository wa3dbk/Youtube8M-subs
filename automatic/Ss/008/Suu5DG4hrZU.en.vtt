00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello to all those case dudes then 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.019
 today I presented you a match 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.700
 a box of which I am particularly 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.549
 Proud for that took a lot of my time 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.410
 to create but finally that's it she is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 this is the project I was talking about 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.340
 in another video just before and whose 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.470
 he finally finished 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.109
 so we can see behind behind 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.480
 me this map snav a single standard 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.279
 let's talk about labyrinth and so it's a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 little adventure map that I propose to you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 today entirely created by my 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 little hands so I do not tell you 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.170
 the number of hours spent but I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.399
 is not even the lack of recoil ask 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 because if there are too many but 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.960
 I am really happy 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 result and so go I wanted to the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 share with us because because 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
 think that very happy that seven matches 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.649
 so this map as you can 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.760
 to see right behind her is called 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.800
 labyrinth I do not know if we see too much 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 because louis ii is raining on my server 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 minecraft minecraft of evil or monique and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 So therefore amap called labyrinth 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.890
 simply because it's a 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.630
 labyrinth 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.850
 so as you can see behind 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.119
 this map is separated into several 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.550
 floors five years of luck and so you 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.149
 have five floors to go for 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.770
 get to the top and finish the match 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.530
 so in this map at each level you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.149
 will have aisne has recovered 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 so there is a hatred that is in 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.830
 india where today level will be so 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.780
 easy to have and a second hidden to 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.880
 interior 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 within the internal level of the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.300
 level you need to find 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.890
 they are more or less well hidden a 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.940
 some level is better others 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 seminars but and that's so it's 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.299
 a little adventure pop that plays on 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.460
 five levels and who I do not think she 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.500
 will not take too long to finish me 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.710
 redo them to see everything worked 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.509
 well 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.770
 at the same time I knew the tablecloth and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 I did not put too much time so I think 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.000
 that it should go if you do not lose 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.409
 too much that is sometimes once at both 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.409
 justin lost while it's me who 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.940
 was ours is so change of place 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.579
 so here I am not going to go back to 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.170
 inside the building I leave you 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.810
 the surprise 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.660
 I might do 1 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.580
 a walkthrough a lot of trouble with 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.860
 English - finally followed for you 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.800
 show to show you could the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.020
 building level but I will not do it 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.790
 in this video I will not do it like 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.870
 the comedy do not want to ruin the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.650
 surprise I really want you 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.880
 discover this for yourself and who we 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.650
 also say what do you think about it is this 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.780
 that it's completely rotten and it's 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.209
 awesome is that good because 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.489
 What do you think 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.610
 he confesses plans nothing actually welcome 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.510
 in labyrinth where I will not go back 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.680
 no longer do your side for the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.680
 building quickly 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.210
 five colors five floors of the same by 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.440
 level would risk a dozen or so 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.040
 the aisne has recovered two colors 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.690
 different 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.950
 and then here I am not big 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.780
 something else to tell him I'm not going 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.000
 stay longer I'm going to put the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.450

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.600
 we're going to test here so it's not a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.230
 very long video phase in 5s a video 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.699
 very long a building from the outside that 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.740
 has not much interested interest in there 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.330
