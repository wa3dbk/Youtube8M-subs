00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.410
 My name is Juan Ignacio Arland and since 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.930
 Almost 30 years ago he prescribed this place that 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.779
 it's the restaurant bar and the restaurant 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.849
 we see or open with in 1983 and from 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.460
 then we are keeping a line 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.189
 quite similar in terms of the type of 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.569
 kitchen with which we work 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.449
 we work with traditional Basque cuisine 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:31.520
 and the emblematic dishes of that kitchen 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.470
 as i say we come 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.440
 doing since that date we have in the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.350
 ground floor of the entrance what is the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.010
 bar which is a typical bar part 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.220
 old in which we offer our 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.960
 customers are thus the typical skewers 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.250
 Maybe more 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.520
 best known are skewers 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.340
 we have a great letter of skewers and in 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.650
 the bottom is where we have the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.170
 dining room in the dining room is where 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 we usually work a la carte and in 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.470
 some cases, we also offer it 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.550
 in the menu of the day 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.110
 as I say the place is 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 it was an old coal mine before 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.560
 turn it into a restaurant this place 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.790
 it was one of the last carboneries that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.790
 there was in the old part of Donostia 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.330
 and even what is the lower part where 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.729
 we are at this time it was also a 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.860
 cider house a series would say of those so 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.659
 ancient ones in which even the kupelas 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 they had to come from andoain by car 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.400
 of oxen but since then for sure 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.460
 things have changed a lot our 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.430
 offer as I say has two slopes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.600
 one is the one related to the bar in the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.360
 we offer the typical pinchos the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.460
 skewers rations cazuelitas and a 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 cook a little more informal and then 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.590
 at the bottom is where we have the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.270
 restaurant where the dishes as I have 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.670
 said before emblematic of the kitchen 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.619
 more traditional Basque like they can be 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.180
 chicken that is the cod to the pil or the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.580
 hake the coastal that we take 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.380
 doing the same since for 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.070
 30 years and that we are doing the one of 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.010
 same way 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.250
 then the txangurro baked and as I say 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.330
 Well, this type of dishes are the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.840
 that we offer to our clients 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.349
 Y 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.510
 in next to me I have our boss of 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.810
 cook over here that what's going 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.379
 riding at this time is one of the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.770
 many skewers that we put in our 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.420
 bar 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.220
 the processes of the skewer that we are going to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.870
 to mount at this time which ones and we are going 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.430
 to introduce you now is one of our 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.850
 skewers that we have in bar is a 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.440
 apple strudel with onion 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.780
 caramelized and finally we make a 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.970
 Modena reduction 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.700
 what we do is finally cut what 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 what is the apple we take a little 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.130
 of slime so it does not rust we have it 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.200
 for a day 24 hours in the camera with 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.670
 a weight so that it is well compacted 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.050
 what are the three ingredients and 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.300
 then and to make it compact and it goes 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.300
 to cut without any problem 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.250
 like a bread toast bread mold 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.330
 previously we have 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.330
 we have toasted 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:01.810
 and a little sugar to caramelize 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.810
 give a contrast of textures 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.420
 efe 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.150
 although golden 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.740
 we always finish it with a reduction 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.740
 of modena 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.510
 it would be our rich simple skewer with 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.060
 taste contrasts 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.180
 in the end what the client likes 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.180
 quite 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.380
 very well then this is one of a sample 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.380
 of 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.790
 with most requested spikes 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.749
 and 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.450
 and as never 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.660
 why 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.800
 why 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.210
 all right 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.170
 and
