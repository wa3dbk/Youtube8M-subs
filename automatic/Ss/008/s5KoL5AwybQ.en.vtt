00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello very good to all I am maximum and 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.730
 we are here in new video of gta 5 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.950
 online and we are with subscribers and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.840
 random people who join and we are in a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.000
 race to all with my mother's marmosets 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.540
 and one that is not my mother my mother 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.430
 one has died 22 have died and here 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.199
 it's not worth here is not no no no no 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.580
 I mean, I was following him he's dead 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.050
 lady doing on the floor for life 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.080
 that is going to run over someone or 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 jamaica although I see them transparent 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.080
 you can operate it anyway let's see 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 I have to take over here with a lot 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.349
 Be careful not to notice and I'm afraid 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.300
 that exploits something very third we have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 here a position of two people all 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 the world has the same car I do not know 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.910
 yes eye or yes sir yes sir first 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.060
 first like that without further clamp 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.550
 point 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.280
 when the point is taken 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.890
 where am I taking point I think it's 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.300
 over there if you have to continue around here it's worth 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.460
 it's worth everyone has stayed 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.860
 inflating uat is from behind is ahead 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.510
 yes yes you have to move forward and 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.340
 I have a plan and it's around here it's not 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.940
 around here I'm not going to pick up points myself 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.350
 no joke or come exploit explodes 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.300
 I think this is going to be very difficult for 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.820
 me since you already know that to me the gloves 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.649
 and those things make me nervous but 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.479
 I always get it always finished 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.590
 getting it and staying first hopefully 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.720
 be first in this game but 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.820
 It costs a lot for what I see but 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.470
 I keep the position less badly than 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.759
 put without contact because if it would not be 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.950
 difficult I just caught the first 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.810
 position and I have done everything from a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.250
 you have seen guys or I have said what 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.720
 said always ended up getting it 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.860
 even if it happens to me 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.170
 look they were exploited because of 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.330
 those lampposts and I go to the mayor of the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.860
 saints tell him he hears those streetlights are 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.140
 too bad there that you have to remove Mr. 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.340
 careful, my mother almost ran over that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.840
 poor lord who was going around 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.420
 sure the next one that was behind 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.130
 I need the bass of my mother car 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.490
 good for now I will continue to be 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.020
 in this streak how many laps are they are 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.310
 three laps so you do two 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.590
 times more and yes twice not or 1 2 and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.750
 the last time until then teammates today 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.820
 you stay I think it was said today I would 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.560
 I'm here this is crazy 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.840
 judy suicide are going to start over here 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.759
 I stay followed by one of them very closely and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.340
 I put it to reach so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.170
 not all the car is very slow and I have it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.239
 behind that is if it goes very slow 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.160
 to see if I do it again at the first 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.080
 but to the first the second as I have 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.090
 done before and sometimes I get it I think 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.640
 that this is fast is fast 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.890
 let's see this actually cheats 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.750
 because this is here not bad of me is 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.070
 they are committing suicide less badly I repeat 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.290
 thank goodness I have put it without contact 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.490
 because I was going to put it in gta iv everything 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.500
 what 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.880
 wait, I take the point that is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.670
 too far you imagine that I take the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.400
 point so we are flying you know at once 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.890
 I'm going this speed is the right 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.390
 let's see the eye has gone ahead 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.380
 because they have told me to see if 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.500
 I keep the position like this we go on 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.620
 well, although it's worth going back to the moment 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.620
 First 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.379
 If I keep straight, be careful with the lamp 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.550
 my mother, now it has worked out well 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.320
 mayor of two saints 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.330
 solving the problem with the lamp 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.850
 you do not have to remove it so 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.590
 now what is left that you remove the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.810
 gentlemen who are going through here look 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.460
 follows me very closely I have I do not have a 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.610
 competition with this from here back I think 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.660
 which is the second no no because it is last 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.940
 so good yes that forward 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.970
 mate nothing happens to look like there is no 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.890
 How is reaching good position and gives 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.780
 I wanted to tell you that I wanted you 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.880
 teach hello with cooperation between 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.410
 last and the first the speed that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.660
 it has or can reach me three times 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.170
 faster than normal you know I go 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.240
 super slow I'm going like a snail 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.100
 and he goes like a hare or like a rabbit 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.200
 running mother of mine you go super fast 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.790
 although it has not been hitting everything 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.890
 but I do not know you do not see the comparison 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.450
 but well, this is also the last 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.570
 back this is the last time I have 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.880
 to do this and this is this is for him 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.850
 this is the time I get to the first 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.220
 let's see if I get the first and there 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.820
 we go there we go for you guys 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.370
 I'm going there or it's bad I got it 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.370
 fatal but rectified and I fall 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.300
 Now yes now the second great 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.580
 city have that the second one goes the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.900
 expired I have left it all the times 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.360
 that the most tried has always gone to the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.570
 second so let's see let's see 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.980
 If I get it, it's worth perfect today 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:31.370
 yes yes, my mother, it's really 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.650
 easy it's pretty easy just like ryder that 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.480
 I have not done well, I almost take the point 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.700
 and everything in there we're going to see we have to 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.620
 do this here from increase has been the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.490
 first position and I'll keep it 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.910
 latent 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.780
 thank goodness I repeat is not cancer 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:52.010
 no less bad with this my mother does not 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.840
 exploded as you see tongue the work 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.850
 thank goodness he is not cited the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.040
 contact in contactless because it is that 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.470
 then I would have crashed more than once 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.720
 with everything that is here at the end like 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.840
 I said it ended up being first that no 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.449
 know how all this is going I do not know how 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.569
 issues of 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.949
 of destiny was first but still 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.830
 a meteor may fall on me 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.360
 head left and get the second to 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.879
 the goal but I see it very difficult because 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.499
 I 've already arrived and well nothing more guys 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.749
