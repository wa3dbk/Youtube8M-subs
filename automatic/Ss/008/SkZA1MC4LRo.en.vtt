00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this earlier that was way way larger not

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
this earlier that was way way larger not
as<00:01:07.650> compact<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:08.880> has<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> lot

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
as compact and this actually has a lot

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.929
