00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
and a little sunnier this would be a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.800 
and a little sunnier this would be a
little<00:01:33.440> bit<00:01:33.530> easier<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.040> you'll<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:34.660> even<00:01:35.660> in

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
little bit easier but you'll see even in

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.060 
little bit easier but you'll see even in
these<00:01:35.900> kind<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.170> conditions<00:01:36.320> hook<00:01:36.619> actually

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
these kind of conditions hook actually

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.120 
these kind of conditions hook actually
it<00:01:37.190> comes<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.550> little<00:01:37.670> bit<00:01:38.740> but<00:01:39.740> you'll<00:01:39.920> see

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
it comes in a little bit but you'll see

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.999 
it comes in a little bit but you'll see
this<00:01:40.750> start<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.869> work<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.530> know<00:01:42.650> not

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
this start to work you know not

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.140 
this start to work you know not
immediately<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:43.700> with<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.850> little<00:01:44.030> bit<00:01:44.119> of

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
immediately but with a little bit of

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.180 
immediately but with a little bit of
work<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.200> that's<00:01:45.290> how<00:01:45.410> much<00:01:45.650> so<00:01:45.860> once<00:01:46.040> he's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190

could take that rag as you can see this

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.160 
could take that rag as you can see this
is<00:01:49.790> all<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.090> old<00:01:50.210> dead<00:01:50.509> paint<00:01:50.780> cells<00:01:51.050> we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.790 
pulled off flip over a couple of times
and<00:01:53.780> use<00:01:53.900> but<00:01:54.110> we're<00:01:54.200> going<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.590> show

go over it again again apply a little
bit<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.690> solution

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.050

the rag obvious this is an older car
it's<00:02:18.400> going<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.580> take<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.820> lot<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> work<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.480> get

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
it's going to take a lot of work to get

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.980 
it's going to take a lot of work to get
it<00:02:19.720> back<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.050> normal<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.680> even<00:02:20.890> see

it back to normal but you can even see

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.990 
it back to normal but you can even see
here<00:02:22.990> show<00:02:23.230> me<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.410> mark<00:02:23.620> again<00:02:23.950> let<00:02:24.790> me<00:02:24.850> try

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
here show me that mark again let me try

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.750 
here show me that mark again let me try
to<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> little<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:25.930> okay<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.580> first

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to get a little more okay but this first

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.000 
to get a little more okay but this first
one<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.270> see<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:31.810> Matt<00:02:32.320> you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
one you can see it was really Matt you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380 
one you can see it was really Matt you
know<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.490> first<00:02:33.640> ride<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.180> got

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
know this is the first ride that we got

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.600 
know this is the first ride that we got
and<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> second<00:02:36.070> one<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.400> see

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
and now that the second one you can see

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.690 
and now that the second one you can see
a<00:02:36.640> much<00:02:37.000> much<00:02:37.590> less<00:02:38.590> contaminants<00:02:39.490> have<00:02:39.580> been

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
a much much less contaminants have been

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.460 
a much much less contaminants have been
pulled<00:02:39.940> off<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.810> acrylic<00:02:41.080> college

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
pulled off so that the acrylic college

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.660 
pulled off so that the acrylic college
is<00:02:41.620> working<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.160> doing<00:02:42.400> what<00:02:42.520> it's<00:02:42.640> supposed

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
is working it's doing what it's supposed

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.920 
is working it's doing what it's supposed
to<00:02:42.940> do

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.869 

so<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:52.650> here's<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> comparison<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
so now here's a comparison this is the

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.800 
so now here's a comparison this is the
first<00:02:54.090> pass<00:02:54.360> through<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.830> second<00:02:56.159> pass

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
first pass through and the second pass

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.089 
first pass through and the second pass
again<00:02:57.810> normally<00:02:58.200> we<00:02:58.290> do<00:02:58.409> this<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:58.680> one<00:02:58.860> rag

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
again normally we do this with one rag

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.710 
again normally we do this with one rag
or<00:02:59.459> just<00:02:59.640> for<00:02:59.790> demonstration<00:03:00.269> purposes<00:03:00.599> we're

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
or just for demonstration purposes we're

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.350 
or just for demonstration purposes we're
going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:01.080> three<00:03:01.739> rags<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.120> show<00:03:03.299> you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
going to do three rags just to show you

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.140 
going to do three rags just to show you
how<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.599> less<00:03:04.940> contaminants<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.030> dead

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
how much less contaminants and dead

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.699 
how much less contaminants and dead
paint<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.569> as<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.720> pull<00:03:06.959> off<00:03:07.110> as<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.530> keep

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
paint so as you pull off as you keep

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.149 
paint so as you pull off as you keep
working<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.220> area<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.440> car<00:03:10.680> did<00:03:10.860> not<00:03:10.920> get

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
working the area and the car did not get

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.710 
working the area and the car did not get
like<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.400> overnight<00:03:11.879> so<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.390> not<00:03:12.569> gonna

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
like this overnight so it's not gonna

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.610 
like this overnight so it's not gonna
come<00:03:13.079> instantly<00:03:13.620> clean<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:15.620> you'll

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
come instantly clean but you'll

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.970 
come instantly clean but you'll
definitely<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.610> huge<00:03:18.390> difference<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
definitely see a huge difference in the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.399 
definitely see a huge difference in the
area<00:03:20.129> that<00:03:20.250> we're<00:03:20.370> working<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:22.110> huge

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
area that we're working and a huge

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.500 
area that we're working and a huge
difference<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.860> amount<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.510> contaminants

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
difference in the amount of contaminants

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.420 
difference in the amount of contaminants
that<00:03:24.690> are<00:03:25.620> being<00:03:25.859> pulled<00:03:26.069> off<00:03:28.010> again<00:03:29.010> red<00:03:29.280> is

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
that are being pulled off again red is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.410 
that are being pulled off again red is
one<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.640> those<00:03:29.760> colors<00:03:30.030> you're<00:03:30.120> going<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.299> see

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
one of those colors you're going to see

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.080 
one of those colors you're going to see
a<00:03:30.450> lot<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.190> really<00:03:32.190> easy<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.579> see<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.849> red
