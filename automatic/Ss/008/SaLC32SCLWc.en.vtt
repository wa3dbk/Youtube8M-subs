00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
that becomes really important because
the<00:01:47.610> sound<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.210> initially<00:01:48.659> comes<00:01:48.960> out<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the sound that initially comes out of

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.480 
the sound that initially comes out of
the<00:01:49.560> speaker<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.509> okay<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.470> great<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the speaker is okay but not great when I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.389 
the speaker is okay but not great when I
boosted<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> base<00:01:54.560> significantly<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.829> was

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
boosted the base significantly I was

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.770 
boosted the base significantly I was
much<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:56.759> impressed<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> sound

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
much more impressed with the sound

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.240 
much more impressed with the sound
coming<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> point<00:01:59.070> where<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
coming off of this to the point where I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
coming off of this to the point where I
really<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.790> enjoyed<00:01:59.820> using<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.630> during

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
really have enjoyed using this during

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.330

off of it let's pull around the back you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.000 
off of it let's pull around the back you
can<00:02:18.819> take<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.170> simply<00:02:20.500> pulls<00:02:20.800> right

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010

which<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.880> also<00:03:40.060> great<00:03:40.450> because<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:41.079> means

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290

portion<00:03:46.599> of<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.230> zagg<00:03:47.500> doesn't

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
portion of this is that zagg doesn't

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.520 
portion of this is that zagg doesn't
include<00:03:48.130> any<00:03:48.400> sort<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.880> storage<00:03:49.359> bag<00:03:49.599> so

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
that you can't carry it safely like

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.020 
that you can't carry it safely like
throw<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.500> in<00:03:53.620> your<00:03:53.650> briefcase<00:03:53.889> unless<00:03:54.790> you

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.610

would have rounded this package out

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.699 
would have rounded this package out
pretty<00:03:59.980> nicely<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.480> thing<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:02.500> get
