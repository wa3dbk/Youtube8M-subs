what<00:00:00.900> are<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.079> most<00:00:01.230> common<00:00:01.680> questions<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.310> get

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
what are the most common questions I get

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.970 
what are the most common questions I get
on<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.909> curlformers<00:00:03.449> video<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.929> did<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.440> I

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
on the curlformers video that I did is I

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.829 
on the curlformers video that I did is I
love<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.430> look<00:00:05.670> but<00:00:05.850> curl<00:00:06.150> forms<00:00:06.450> are<00:00:06.600> so

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
love the look but curl forms are so

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.990 
love the look but curl forms are so
expensive<00:00:07.200> how<00:00:07.980> do<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.160> get<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.400> same<00:00:08.670> look

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
expensive how do we get the same look

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.540 
expensive how do we get the same look
but<00:00:09.330> for<00:00:09.570> less<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:11.130> I've<00:00:11.309> finally

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
but for less and I think I've finally

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.749 
but for less and I think I've finally
found<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.030> solution<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.719> caruso<00:00:13.730> steamrollers

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
found a solution and caruso steamrollers

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.599 
found a solution and caruso steamrollers
these<00:00:15.389> are<00:00:15.570> amazing<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.710> half<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.369> cost

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
these are amazing they are half the cost

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.269 
these are amazing they are half the cost
of<00:00:17.990> curlformers<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.350> they're<00:00:19.529> faster<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of curlformers but they're faster and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.790 
of curlformers but they're faster and
easier<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:21.510> only<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.289> an<00:00:22.439> added

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
easier and not only that but an added

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.470 
easier and not only that but an added
bonus<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.430> don't<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> sleep<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
bonus is you don't have to sleep on the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.830 
bonus is you don't have to sleep on the
little<00:00:24.779> comfortable<00:00:25.109> curlers<00:00:25.710> anymore

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
little comfortable curlers anymore

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.540 
little comfortable curlers anymore
basically<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:28.199> rely<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.500> steam<00:00:29.039> instead<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
basically they rely on steam instead of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.220 
basically they rely on steam instead of
heat<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> set<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> curl<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.869> there's<00:00:31.050> no

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
heat to set the curl so there's no

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.959 
heat to set the curl so there's no
damage<00:00:31.500> done<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.070> hair<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> use

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.520 
damage done to your hair when you use
them<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.690> means<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.200> use<00:00:34.230> them<00:00:34.440> on

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
them that means you can use them on

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.290 
them that means you can use them on
clean<00:00:34.890> hair<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.730> use<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.030> dirty

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
clean hair you can use them on dirty

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
clean hair you can use them on dirty
hair<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.140> even<00:00:37.530> use<00:00:37.649> them<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.160> over

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.010 

starting<00:01:09.610> with<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> empty<00:01:10.180> white<00:01:10.420> reservoir

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
starting with the empty white reservoir

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.810 
starting with the empty white reservoir
fill<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.590> with<00:01:11.710> water<00:01:11.950> until<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.430> reaches<00:01:12.730> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
fill it with water until it reaches the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.200 
fill it with water until it reaches the
level<00:01:12.970> indicated<00:01:13.600> on<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> inside

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
level indicated on the inside

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.360 

then<00:01:17.210> place<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.840> red<00:01:18.170> unit<00:01:18.470> on<00:01:18.590> top<00:01:18.620> and<00:01:19.130> turn

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
then place the red unit on top and turn

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.420 
then place the red unit on top and turn
it<00:01:19.550> on<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.960> use<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.140> ionic<00:01:21.560> setting<00:01:21.980> because<00:01:22.310> it

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
it on I use the ionic setting because it

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.860 
it on I use the ionic setting because it
produces<00:01:22.760> more<00:01:22.970> stain<00:01:23.240> than<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.540> regular

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
produces more stain than the regular

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.290 
produces more stain than the regular
setting<00:01:24.050> does<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.340> unit<00:01:25.640> doesn't<00:01:25.820> take<00:01:26.090> long

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
setting does the unit doesn't take long

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.120 
setting does the unit doesn't take long
to<00:01:26.330> heat<00:01:26.630> up<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.960> in<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.410> few<00:01:27.590> seconds<00:01:27.980> you
