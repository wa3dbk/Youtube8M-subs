we're told by Captain America following
the<00:04:51.390> reveal<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.900> his<00:04:52.020> plan<00:04:52.320> is<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.920> his

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
the reveal of his plan is that his

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.220 
the reveal of his plan is that his
existence<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.090> considered<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.660> loose<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.050> by

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
existence is considered a loose and by

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.080 
existence is considered a loose and by
Hydra<00:04:55.680> in<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.950> hand<00:04:56.190> which<00:04:56.520> seems<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.970> be

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
Hydra in the hand which seems to be

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.030 
Hydra in the hand which seems to be
something<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:57.690> they<00:04:58.110> look<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.320> correct<00:04:58.740> and

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
something that they look to correct and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.340 
something that they look to correct and
so<00:04:59.730> while<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.090> group<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.510> awaiting<00:05:01.140> the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
so while the group is awaiting the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.530 
so while the group is awaiting the
expected<00:05:01.920> arrival<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.490> wool<00:05:02.700> rain<00:05:02.940> what<00:05:03.450> we

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
expected arrival of wool rain what we

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.390 
expected arrival of wool rain what we
find<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.350> proximity<00:05:04.770> alarm<00:05:05.220> goes

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
find is that the proximity alarm goes

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.240 
find is that the proximity alarm goes
off<00:05:05.630> when<00:05:06.630> kitty<00:05:06.930> pryde<00:05:07.140> declares<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.980> she's

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
off when kitty pryde declares that she's

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.860 
off when kitty pryde declares that she's
unable<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.790> actually<00:05:09.000> physically<00:05:09.510> see

unable to actually physically see
Wolverine<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.860> reason<00:05:11.160> for<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.580> is

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
Wolverine the reason for this is

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.880 
Wolverine the reason for this is
