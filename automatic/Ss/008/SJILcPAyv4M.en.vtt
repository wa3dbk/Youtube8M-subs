 And such a little bit fantastic 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.199
 whose characters are called 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.859
 Valk is on the one hand sort of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.300
 little animals 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.890
 but not quite animals because 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.020
 for example, you can turn it inside out 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 wash and then hang on a string 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.820
 both underwear and bada which on one side 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.040
 sort of like horned and horns he can change 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.289
 wear one another so on but 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 In this he is a black bada and is somehow 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.110
 such an interesting creature only 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.829
 from afar reminiscent of some such 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.949
 in Lviv similar to great well straight 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.530
 let's say some dad who means 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.240
 required necessarily small juice 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.720
 because their mom is missing here 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 such bada 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 This book is for children on education 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 parents what does the subtitle mean 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 It means that you expect an exciting 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.960
 fairy tale where it will be in game situations 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.780
 played a lot of conflict 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.040
 family situations are so serious 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.390
 such gloomy words should be described 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.329
 fun completely aerial matter 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 this tale sounds endlessly shows 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.950
 starting from the beginning they attend to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.890
 drop how they sing originated in 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.049
 jars of honey here and are demanding 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.880
 constant attention coming up something 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.189
 continually mischievous and poor bug 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.070
 forced to mess with them in what 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.200
 The charm of this book is probably from one 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.619
 parties this is not a small fraction of this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 charm gives the book ease with 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.630
 where water solves these 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 its problem juices something 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.090
 offended by no one gets upset 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.410
 reconciles with them again but in any 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.570
 case here 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.390
 extraordinary kindness itself a fairy tale it 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.370
 outweighs anything thing 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 more importantly in this tale then I tongue 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.110
 where it is written here constantly 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.240
 language game language game 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.590
 beating up the meaning of words which in 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:34.410
 life is not applicable well every word 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.020
 which child first hears him 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.120
 be sure to beat him 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.120
 it is necessary to ask why 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.920
 clothespins stinging nose is pinching our 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.950
 they shout right 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.990
 understand how words are arranged and these 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.140
 sense and they are throughout the whole tale 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.870
 there are always cute words 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.730
 occupation that zoks indulge in this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 the book they all have parallels with 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.810
 normal family life and what can I 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.600
 say about the fairy tale sounds and bada this 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.910
 the book well, that's just categorically 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.370

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.220
 very fun to read to children and very funny 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.870
 read to an adult but but as I said 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.400
 here it happens all the time 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.820
 a phenomenon some conflict behavior 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.150

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.540
 miss out and in the end probably correct 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.150
 conclusions will say that the sounds are very 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.340
 love bado despite the fact that it requires 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.450
 his year care attention 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.820
 abad 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.670
