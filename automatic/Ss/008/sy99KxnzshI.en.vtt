preloaded<00:00:28.060> with<00:00:28.180> topo<00:00:28.539> maps<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:29.440> that's<00:00:29.650> why<00:00:29.830> I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
preloaded with topo maps so that's why I

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.339 
preloaded with topo maps so that's why I
have<00:00:30.070> street-level<00:00:30.550> mapping<00:00:31.060> if<00:00:31.990> you<00:00:32.109> get<00:00:32.320> a

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
have street-level mapping if you get a

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.689

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
different type of unit you will have to

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.849 
different type of unit you will have to
load<00:00:33.909> this<00:00:34.089> with<00:00:34.329> mapping<00:00:34.809> software<00:00:35.319> to<00:00:35.649> see

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
load this with mapping software to see

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.979 
load this with mapping software to see
this<00:00:36.039> type<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.309> maps<00:00:36.729> but<00:00:37.510> that<00:00:37.629> just<00:00:37.749> gives

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
this type of maps but that just gives

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.559 
this type of maps but that just gives
you<00:00:38.050> an<00:00:38.109> idea<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.409> how<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.589> map<00:00:38.829> screen<00:00:39.129> looks

then we have our contacts so I can check
for<00:00:58.329> them<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:58.839> then<00:00:59.019> I<00:00:59.109> can<00:00:59.170> send<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.530> note<00:00:59.709> with

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
for them and then I can send a note with

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.869 
for them and then I can send a note with
this<00:01:00.219> unit<00:01:01.209> to<00:01:01.569> another<00:01:02.170> unit<00:01:02.670> compass

settings<00:01:44.560> changing<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.280> settings<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.790> unit

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
settings changing the settings the unit

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.330 
settings changing the settings the unit
so<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.330> can<00:01:46.540> jump<00:01:46.750> around<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.110> here<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.590> look<00:01:48.250> at

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
so I can jump around in here and look at

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.260 
so I can jump around in here and look at
different<00:01:48.610> things<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.940> they<00:01:49.030> need<00:01:49.240> to

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
different things that they need to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.840 
different things that they need to
change<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:50.320> make<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.620> more<00:01:50.800> my<00:01:51.130> unit<00:01:51.580> rather

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
change to make it more my unit rather

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.640 
change to make it more my unit rather
than<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.180> default<00:01:52.420> settings<00:01:53.050> that<00:01:53.230> come<00:01:53.500> in

the<00:01:53.740> unit<00:01:53.980> when<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:55.770> mark<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.890> waypoint

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the unit when you get it mark a waypoint

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.320 
the unit when you get it mark a waypoint
it<00:01:58.750> does<00:01:58.960> exactly<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.860> can<00:02:00.250> save<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.820> save

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
it does exactly that I can save and save

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.880 
it does exactly that I can save and save
and<00:02:01.510> edit<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.200> go<00:02:02.320> through<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.620> change

here<00:02:17.240> on<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.390> radio<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.080> can<00:02:18.140> get<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.470> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
here on the radio so you can get to it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.350 
here on the radio so you can get to it
in<00:02:18.620> two<00:02:18.800> ways<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.310> governments<00:02:19.970> put<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> quick

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
in two ways so governments put a quick

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.050 
in two ways so governments put a quick
button<00:02:20.690> there<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.080> radio<00:02:21.380> page<00:02:22.060> camera

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
button there on the radio page camera

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.270 
button there on the radio page camera
obviously<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.320> exactly<00:02:24.800> what<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.040> is

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
obviously that's exactly what it is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.210 
obviously that's exactly what it is
let's<00:02:26.060> put<00:02:26.240> something<00:02:26.420> behind<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:28.100> my

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
let's put something behind it it's my

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.630 
let's put something behind it it's my
hand

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
hand

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.610 
hand
so<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> back<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.110> unit<00:02:30.350> here<00:02:30.590> I

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
so it's in the back of the unit here I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.990 
so it's in the back of the unit here I
can<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:30.860> see<00:02:31.130> straight<00:02:31.430> through<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:31.880> it's

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
can just see straight through it so it's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.650 
can just see straight through it so it's
quite<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.330> good<00:02:32.510> five<00:02:32.690> megapixel<00:02:33.380> camera<00:02:34.660> notes

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
quite a good five megapixel camera notes

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.870 
quite a good five megapixel camera notes
again<00:02:36.170> sending<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.920> note<00:02:37.100> with<00:02:37.310> my<00:02:37.430> unit<00:02:37.760> which

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
again sending a note with my unit which

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.880 
again sending a note with my unit which

just showing you that the top quarter a
top<00:03:23.660> third<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.110> be<00:03:24.140> changed<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:24.880> let's<00:03:25.880> click

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
top third can be changed so let's click

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.940 
top third can be changed so let's click
on<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.660> can<00:03:26.810> change<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.470> automotive

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
on that you can change the automotive

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.490 
on that you can change the automotive
now<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.940> top<00:03:29.270> third<00:03:30.260> changes<00:03:31.060> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
now the top third changes and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.220 
now the top third changes and
recreational<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.650> how<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.010> was<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:35.110> would<00:03:36.110> if

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
recreational is how it was I would if

it's wrapped planner we've done that one
elevation<00:03:39.530> plot<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:41.300> that's<00:03:41.480> my<00:03:41.630> elevation

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989
