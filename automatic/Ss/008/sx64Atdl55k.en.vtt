thing<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.270> argan<00:03:30.480> oil<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.780> doing<00:03:30.959> for<00:03:31.140> me<00:03:31.200> but

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
thing that argan oil is doing for me but

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.010 
thing that argan oil is doing for me but

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
argan oil and it's been making a huge

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.710 
argan oil and it's been making a huge
difference<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.030> that's<00:03:36.180> why<00:03:36.330> I'm<00:03:36.420> working
