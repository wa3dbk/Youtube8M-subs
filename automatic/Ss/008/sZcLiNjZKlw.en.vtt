wet<00:00:44.910> anymore<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.769> just<00:00:46.920> let

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
wet anymore and then I kind of just let

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.840 
wet anymore and then I kind of just let
it<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.449> is<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:49.199> now<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.890> let<00:00:50.640> air

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
it be like it is right now and let air

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.660 
it be like it is right now and let air
dry<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.420> rest<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:51.960> most<00:00:52.140> part<00:00:52.670> okay

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
dry for the rest for the most part okay

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.759 
dry for the rest for the most part okay
so<00:00:54.269> it<00:00:55.050> did<00:00:55.860> curl<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.769> it's

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
so it did curl back the way it was it's

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.770 
so it did curl back the way it was it's
not<00:00:59.040> as<00:00:59.220> tight<00:00:59.580> of<00:00:59.610> Icarus<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.330> I<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.570> got

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
not as tight of Icarus when I first got

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
not as tight of Icarus when I first got
it<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.019> could<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> difference<00:01:01.799> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it it could be the difference in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.799 
it it could be the difference in
products<00:01:02.580> that<00:01:02.729> I<00:01:02.760> used<00:01:02.970> it<00:01:03.510> could<00:01:03.690> also

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
products that I used it could also

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.570 
products that I used it could also
because<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.290> straightened<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> double

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
because I straightened it and double

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
because I straightened it and double
process<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.750> either<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> curl<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
process this but either way the curl is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.109 
process this but either way the curl is
still<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.520> pleased<00:01:08.970> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
still there so I'm very pleased with

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.550 
still there so I'm very pleased with

your web speak or you sold him in and I
didn't<00:04:37.810> do<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.740> would<00:04:39.340> purchased<00:04:39.699> his

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820
