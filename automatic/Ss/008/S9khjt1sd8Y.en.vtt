00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 Hello, how about friends, friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.759
 I am Paulina Gomez, the woman 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.190
 and today I 'm going to tell you about 10 things that 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.139
 they passed me in the 20s and now I do not 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.020
 happen as when I was in the 20 yo 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.869
 I thought I was 7 I was throwing myself 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.539
 bondi of the parachute from kingdom to no 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.610
 true of six flags all sides and me 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.740
 nothing happened to me because I never got 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.560
 nothing will happen now on the third floor 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.039
 it turns me of sun 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.860
 I will vote or I get dizzy I think ten times and 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:38.000
 new to die no longer no other things 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.940
 is that when I went to the nightclub 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.829
 in my twenties I arrived at the antro 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.219
 eleven o'clock at night I was the most 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:53.609
 good I start to take my technique that 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.609
 I put it there at night 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.260
 now I do not start taking from 11 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.540
 the night now I start to take from the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.460
 3 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.820
 what happened in the 20s that before 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260
 we thought less or not now in the third 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.610
 floor I think because where by the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.430
 recruitment is the strategy if by 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.040
 ahead because that's why that's why 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 that then in the 20 action 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.990
 I invincible tough karate now I am 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.840
 more feminine and we already left came out to 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.230
 floated earlier in the 20s I listened to a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:40.840
 little boy in escuintla now I say today what 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.840
 nice how will I look like mom 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.840
 here is not this a subject that I can not 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.270
 explain a lot because I have it forbidden 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.079
 but in the 20 after he enjoyed his 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.340
 sexuality but people or that was how 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.909
 to six children 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.030
 dziwisz and now in this service is for 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.030
 there 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.840
 before I believe that this had already said 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.259
 well I yoga meditation spirituality 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.470
 and now it's just the opposite 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.409
 now I believe even in the light I think 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.599
 light light in the twenties that pass 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.260

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.510

 be tower of the movie thor and sure 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.819
 so I hope I'm still saying 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.610
 The truth is that I'm not finishing that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.659
 dream but if I thought more about a prince 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.390
 blue now we already think or I already think about 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.590
 otherwise not so much in the torwar 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.140
 but by bus that here before not 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.569
 I was giving so much thought to things now 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.019
 I think more and we put the 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.230
 things more obviously obviously 20 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.420
 I said I want to live alone I did not live alone 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.209
 I lived with my dads, nice to live with your 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.450
 dads because they give you everything you have everything you 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.000
 wash the clothes they stop the light 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 if something happens in the house they make you the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.500
 please fix the plumbing until you 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.090
 own plumbing but when one lives 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.610
 you just have to fix it and 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.400
 stop gas light your plumbing 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.310
 would suppress but it's really fun so 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.510

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.510
