00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.280
 Hello dear anime lovers you 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.419
 Watch youtube channel and not becoming it 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.809
 overview of them 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.570
 different so let's start this anime 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.880
 belongs to the genres school mysticism horrors and 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.710
 thriller and all these genres are very good 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.560
 show you in this anime 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.660
 especially horror genres but if these 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.669
 genres are alien to you should not do 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.070
 hasty conclusions and put on this anime 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.770
 anime cross is quite interesting and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.750
 intriguing and original and it is quite 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.850
 can hook even if you donâ€™t 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.860
 lover of similar genres plot here 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.620
 not at all weak, quite the contrary 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.170
 even strong there is no pattern or 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 the banality of the main plot is to 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.489
 volume in third grade 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.440
 systematic once a month dies from 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.109
 of the sword again in the case of one student or 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.219
 someone else who is associated with this class 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.559
 This is due to the fact that in the classroom 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.289
 there is one extra person dead person 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.750
 ghost and so his aura a 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.479
 perhaps he himself frees you a place 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.759
 it all started 27 years ago when 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.189
 popular and beloved girl from 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.650
 this class misaki died in a miserable 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.320
 case of her and so loved that everyone started 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.090
 pretend like she is still alive 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.380
 perhaps therefore since the souls of the dead 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.420
 began to come to this class 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.729
 to feel you alive again 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.439
 so the students of this class live in 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.710
 terrible hope that this year all 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.630
 will cost the main characters not misaki 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 girls for some unknown reason 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.939
 no one notices and from which 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.369
 the beginning literally blows cold and death 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:40.920
 her name alone introduces the disciples of it 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.920
 class horror misaki claws 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.080
 who's her name is misaki mei 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 she is still wearing a bandage on her left eye 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 what 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 but say sakuragi 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.100
 here they are what you think yes needle 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.140
 we can not that we can not 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:17.159
 class would not be able to pronounce their anime and 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.019
 the lad to and the heaths of the bar translated as 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.829
 time this fatal year this damn 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.469
 the class 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.599
 and that's what's interesting is he the only one 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.849
 sees and contacts my stacks 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.829
 maybe we are the very ghost 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.439
 due to which all misfortunes occur 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.120
 is this so if you want to know the answer 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.609
 this question you have to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.950
 watch anime also want to say that 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.290
 this is just the tip of the main iceberg 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.720
 the plot is bigger and more intriguing 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.030
 than what I told you even though it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.099
 anime does not tell right away but how 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.829
 see even this little part of the plot 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.480
 very interesting and original way 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.909
 pro originality accidents 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.709
 the authors are not deprived of this either 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.200
 tried and every accident 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.210
 colorful memorable and not like 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.280
 other 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.620
 Tin-loving people will definitely like it 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.690
 such moments but if you don't love 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.030
 such that you should think about 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.980
 worth watching this anime or not here 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.770
 there are not many such moments but 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.990
 a lot though if you flood the anime then 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.790
 I think you will be able to master them but 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.040
 if you are a nervous person or in 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.900
 communicate like that all you 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.060
 better get past that anime 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.850
 especially considering that the final is very 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.220
 colorful so consider this and by the way not 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.470
 it's worth thinking that this is the main feature of anime 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.570
 also has a very strong atmosphere and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.060
 throughout the time causes 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.560
 a sense of suspense and performance 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.900
 sometimes even fear 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.970
 As for the minuses, there is nothing special about them 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.740
 maybe watching this anime you will find 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.690
 what are the cons but here most likely 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.330
 it will be their business and already in your 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.460
 personal taste or in the genre is possible 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.180
 this anime is not a masterpiece but it is what 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.070
 must be 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.560
 is very good worthy and 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.600
 quality representative of their genres 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.360
 Well, this review is coming to an end 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.520
