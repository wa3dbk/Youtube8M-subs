00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
and the answer is first of all it
latches<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> only<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> market

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
latches it's the only one in the market

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.660 
latches it's the only one in the market
with<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> real<00:01:54.750> Apple<00:01:55.740> certified<00:01:55.890> latching

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
with a real Apple certified latching

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.980 
with a real Apple certified latching
mechanism<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> squeeze<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
mechanism so you have to squeeze the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.499 
mechanism so you have to squeeze the
buttons<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.369> secondly<00:01:59.880> once

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
buttons to get it off and secondly once

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
buttons to get it off and secondly once
it's<00:02:00.750> latched<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.680> actually<00:02:02.009> really

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it's latched on it's actually really

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
it's latched on it's actually really
comfortable<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:02.909> hand<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.810> you're<00:02:03.960> not

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
comfortable in your hand but you're not

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.450 
comfortable in your hand but you're not
going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> walk<00:02:04.710> around<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.070> day<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
going to walk around all day with this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.819 
going to walk around all day with this
thing<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:05.909> probably<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.560> set

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
thing on there probably because you set

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
thing on there probably because you set
it<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.399> leave<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:08.819> 15<00:02:09.330> minutes<00:02:09.509> at

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it down and leave it for 15 minutes at

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.809 
it down and leave it for 15 minutes at
your<00:02:09.869> desk<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:10.920> lunch<00:02:11.129> or

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
your desk or at lunch or

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.899 
your desk or at lunch or
it's<00:02:12.510> got<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.719> top<00:02:12.900> off<00:02:13.140> your<00:02:13.170> iPhone

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
it's got to top off your iPhone

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's got to top off your iPhone
relatively<00:02:14.909> quickly<00:02:15.150> say<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.049> your<00:02:16.319> iphones

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
relatively quickly say it's your iphones

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.949 
relatively quickly say it's your iphones
down<00:02:16.889> to<00:02:17.010> half<00:02:17.219> maybe<00:02:17.609> in<00:02:17.819> 30<00:02:18.209> or<00:02:18.359> 40<00:02:18.659> minutes

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
down to half maybe in 30 or 40 minutes

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.559 
down to half maybe in 30 or 40 minutes
this<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.409> bring<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.739> back<00:02:19.859> to<00:02:20.040> full<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> you

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
this will bring it back to full so you

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.899 
this will bring it back to full so you
put<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.049> once<00:02:22.379> or<00:02:22.530> twice<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.799> day<00:02:23.099> maybe<00:02:23.430> 15

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
put this on once or twice a day maybe 15

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.059 
put this on once or twice a day maybe 15
minutes<00:02:24.060> each<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.959> tops<00:02:25.200> off<00:02:25.469> your<00:02:25.680> iPhone

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
minutes each and it tops off your iPhone

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.099 
minutes each and it tops off your iPhone
the<00:02:26.549> nice<00:02:26.730> thing<00:02:26.760> about<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.389> is<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.810> could

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
the nice thing about that is you could

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.830 
the nice thing about that is you could
use<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.709> case<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.480> course<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
use the case that you like of course I

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
use the case that you like of course I
like<00:02:30.989> our<00:02:31.170> Richard<00:02:31.439> solar<00:02:31.650> case<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.609> you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
like our Richard solar case but you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.039 
like our Richard solar case but you
don't<00:02:32.849> have<00:02:32.969> to<00:02:33.150> use<00:02:33.269> our<00:02:33.450> case<00:02:33.659> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.930> use

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
don't have to use our case you can use

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.580 
don't have to use our case you can use
any<00:02:34.230> case<00:02:34.469> and<00:02:35.239> attach<00:02:36.239> our<00:02:36.420> iPhone<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.049> even

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
though you worry oh I wonder if it'll

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.640 
though you worry oh I wonder if it'll
hurt<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.480> connector<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.409> sort<00:02:40.590> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
hurt the connector if it's sort of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
hurt the connector if it's sort of
flexing<00:02:41.219> it<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.999> answer<00:02:42.389> is<00:02:42.419> we<00:02:42.689> have

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
flexing it all the answer is we have

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.140 
flexing it all the answer is we have
never<00:02:43.109> had<00:02:43.439> a<00:02:43.680> complaint<00:02:43.859> of<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.909> broken

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
never had a complaint of a broken

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.149 
never had a complaint of a broken
connector<00:02:45.719> so<00:02:46.169> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.319> people<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.829> just<00:02:47.099> to

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
connector so I think people know just to

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.009 
connector so I think people know just to
be<00:02:47.310> able<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.489> careful<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.540> let<00:02:48.719> me<00:02:48.780> tell<00:02:48.930> you
