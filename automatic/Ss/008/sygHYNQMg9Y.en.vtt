00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.299
 yes no surprise I will go for sure in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.580
 early season I was not expecting 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.980
 as much as play but after I have everything 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.880
 I did everything for I think since 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.740
 since the recovery 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.830
 hachey I gave myself all the means 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.539
 for to be part of the group 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.880
 and that's pretty good 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.650
 me this season and here I hope that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 it will continue in young people where I was 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 operated twice within two years 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.349
 so so that can be easy for 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 I did not play much I had 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.430
 I do not have a lot of rhythm and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.649
 since then since the recovery jean 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 I try to jessey professionals at 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.370
 maximum fifteen years whether on the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.950
 field or outside 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 here is the chance for the moment of 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 two to have play time to be 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 to be beginning to be present at 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.660
 workouts of I try to give everything 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 and that's okay for now 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 frozen experienced enough as not a disappointment 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.690
 but a little bit a tv a little bit 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.570
 just a frustration because I think 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 that in the content we have we are afraid we 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 was not that bad I think 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.439
 that we left them more than 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.049
 that they took it from us after they 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.720
 paradoxically paradoxically it's still 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.890
 one of my best matches 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.780
 personally but but the group 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 loses so so here it is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.259
 it's still a questioning 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 permed 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.509
 and so that's for sure 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.310
 know it's still a disappointment 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.869
 but I do not worry I know 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 we will quickly get back on Sunday night 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.439
 for the team, it is certain that it remains 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.079
 still a shot two days the start 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.700
 from Michel after that I'm not going 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.140
 do not hide it for sure it's me 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.290
 give it does not give anymore 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 responsibility of that only michel 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 be gone for sure that's me I'm I 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 am I only left winger who stays 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 in the squad but but the coach has it 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.090
 said I'm not going to have had a highway 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 in front of me too so that's it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 now it's up to me indirectly 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.990
 it gives me more responsibility in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.750
 group so here I hope I hope I do not 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.180
 not disappoint the group is not disappointing 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.439
 the coach yeah bah it's sure that if we have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.759
 always need that we play that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.740
 game offensively we still need 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.000
 to help stage whether it's not decisive or 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.100
 two goals 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.780
 So here it trots a little bit in 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.310
 heads but without so much 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 put put pressure he counts 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.710
 so here it is I still think about it 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.860
 my first goal but but but 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.610
 that's it it disturbs me no more 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 that on the ground 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.920
 no, it's still something 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.100
 that I worked it is sure that ron 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.620
 young gt gt that's gt gt paul plus the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.420
 biggest defender on the attackers 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.500
 and yeah that's still a domain 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 on which I have beautiful soap 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 workouts is ok I still force myself 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.850
 today for now it does not stay 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.590
 my priority is for sure that I start 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.200
 still in the professional world I have 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.660
 I have not done my hole yet 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.610
 it was necessary to enter the team and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.010
 it's really about that for now 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.380
 I base my priority it's really it's 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.440
 really the Olympique Lyonnais is 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.930
 for now and then we'll see but 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.180
 I work with with guillaume the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.890
 the assistant robert duverne to help 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.110
 a little bit muscle all that but 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.900
 but I'm not worried it'll come 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.340
 with time but that's it remains a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.160
 domain on which I have 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.260
 progressed after that I can not 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.459
 to take from here un this like that so 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.700
 so here I do what it takes to 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.320
 for price it comes and we'll see yeah 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.880
 Well, it's true that at the beginning of the season 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.190
 also had the largest workforce 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.150
 but with a lot of injuries so we 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.610
 came back a little bit to the same 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.200
 situation we are currently 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.360
 so here we take knows that it's going to be 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 a busy schedule with europa 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.049
 league but we take the matches we did not 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.060
 not yet say the workforce for himself 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.470
 project on several matches so we 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.600
 really takes the matches one by one 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.910
 as they come and we do we do 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.860
 with the squad we have and here we go 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.400
 recover Italy said me too who 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.920
 is on the return 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.040
 so that's always it's always 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.040
 good
