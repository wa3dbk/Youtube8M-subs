5.7 notes are out and overall the patch
looks<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.490> be<00:00:05.580> pretty<00:00:05.609> solid<00:00:06.240> there<00:00:06.810> weren't

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
looks to be pretty solid there weren't

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.720 
looks to be pretty solid there weren't
that<00:00:07.109> many<00:00:07.259> changes<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> couple<00:00:08.340> were<00:00:08.550> hit

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
that many changes and a couple were hit

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.610 
that many changes and a couple were hit
or<00:00:08.880> miss<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.630> most<00:00:09.780> part<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:10.230> pretty

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
or miss but for the most part I'm pretty

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.129 
or miss but for the most part I'm pretty
satisfied<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:11.280> dispatch<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.300> as<00:00:12.509> always<00:00:12.840> I'm

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
satisfied with dispatch so as always I'm

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.959 
satisfied with dispatch so as always I'm
here<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> give<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.620> my<00:00:13.740> rundown<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.429> analysis

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
here to give you my rundown and analysis

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.580 
here to give you my rundown and analysis
of<00:00:15.120> all<00:00:15.389> major<00:00:15.660> changes<00:00:16.199> let's<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.039> started

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
of all major changes let's get started

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.500 
of all major changes let's get started
starting<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> champion<00:00:20.400> changes<00:00:20.910> first

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
starting with the champion changes first

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
starting with the champion changes first
off<00:00:21.750> bard<00:00:22.109> received<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.619> buffed<00:00:22.920> was<00:00:23.279> base

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
off bard received a buffed was base

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.929 
off bard received a buffed was base
stats<00:00:23.880> passive<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.630> q<00:00:25.260> damage<00:00:25.949> overall<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
stats passive and q damage overall the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.429 
stats passive and q damage overall the
buff<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> his<00:00:27.330> Q<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> mostly<00:00:28.080> insignificant

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
buff to his Q is mostly insignificant

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
buff to his Q is mostly insignificant
since<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.160> really<00:00:29.369> only<00:00:29.490> buffed<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> ratio

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
since they really only buffed the ratio

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
since they really only buffed the ratio
and<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.080> won't<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.320> building<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.800> pee<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.130> him

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and you won't be building a pee on him

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700 
and you won't be building a pee on him
anyways<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> buff<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> passive<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
anyways but the buff to the passive is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
anyways but the buff to the passive is
quite<00:00:35.010> nice<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.760> combo<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.719> buff<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
quite nice and in combo with the buff to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
quite nice and in combo with the buff to
his<00:00:37.320> base<00:00:37.590> attack<00:00:37.980> damage<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.640> armor<00:00:39.030> it's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
his base attack damage and armor it's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
his base attack damage and armor it's
actually<00:00:39.899> pretty<00:00:40.050> significant<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> his

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
actually pretty significant to his

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
actually pretty significant to his
laning<00:00:41.129> power<00:00:41.430> his<00:00:42.059> auto<00:00:42.270> attack<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> rash

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
laning power his auto attack a rash

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
laning power his auto attack a rash
should<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.290> reasonably<00:00:43.980> improved<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
should be reasonably improved and so

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
should be reasonably improved and so
overall<00:00:45.239> his<00:00:45.450> laning<00:00:45.690> phase<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.170> better<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
overall his laning phase is better I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
overall his laning phase is better I
still<00:00:47.760> don't<00:00:47.910> think<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.120> enough<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.420> him<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
still don't think it's enough for him to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
still don't think it's enough for him to
be<00:00:48.840> played<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> competitive<00:00:49.680> level

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
be played at the competitive level

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.889 
be played at the competitive level
though<00:00:50.309> since<00:00:50.550> he<00:00:50.670> does<00:00:50.850> suffer<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> lot<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
though since he does suffer in a lot of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
though since he does suffer in a lot of
areas<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> has<00:00:52.710> quite<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> few<00:00:53.340> major<00:00:53.699> problems

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
areas and has quite a few major problems

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.319 
areas and has quite a few major problems
but<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> could<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.230> wrong<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.710> we'll<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.329> blitz

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
but I could be wrong so we'll see blitz

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.319 
but I could be wrong so we'll see blitz
cranks<00:00:57.750> w<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.739> provides<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.460> much<00:00:59.760> larger

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
cranks w now provides a much larger

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
cranks w now provides a much larger
movement<00:01:00.840> speed<00:01:01.050> boost<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.530> cast<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.129> decays

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
movement speed boost on cast that decays

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.460 
movement speed boost on cast that decays
over<00:01:02.730> time<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> slows<00:01:04.170> them<00:01:04.350> by

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
over time but then it slows them by

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
over time but then it slows them by
thirty<00:01:04.830> percent<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.489> his<00:01:05.610> W<00:01:05.970> runs<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
thirty percent when his W runs out now

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.570 
thirty percent when his W runs out now
at<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.799> actually<00:01:07.920> thought<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
at first I actually thought this was a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.480 
at first I actually thought this was a
really<00:01:09.000> cool<00:01:09.180> change<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> realized

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
really cool change but then I realized

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
really cool change but then I realized
that<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.970> actually<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.900> really

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that this is actually a really really

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
that this is actually a really really
big<00:01:13.619> nerf<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.909> reason<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
big nerf and the reason for this is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.469 
big nerf and the reason for this is
adding<00:01:16.140> an<00:01:16.229> element<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> kit<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> punishes

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
adding an element to a kit that punishes

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
adding an element to a kit that punishes
itself<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.320> honestly<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.070> really

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
itself is honestly a really

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.030 
itself is honestly a really
disappointing<00:01:20.880> change<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> fact<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
disappointing change like the fact that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.300 
disappointing change like the fact that
the<00:01:23.280> W<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.299> cooldown<00:01:24.630> should<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.770> enough

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the W is on cooldown should be enough

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
the W is on cooldown should be enough
punishment<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.119> him<00:01:27.390> wasting<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> w<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
punishment for him wasting is w but this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.789 
punishment for him wasting is w but this
extra<00:01:29.850> slow<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.840> significant<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
extra slow is really significant and it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.859 
extra slow is really significant and it
makes<00:01:31.979> blitzcrank<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> lot<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.240> vulnerable

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
makes blitzcrank a lot more vulnerable

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
makes blitzcrank a lot more vulnerable
sure<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> might<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.100> easier<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.939> those

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
sure it might be easier to go for those

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.929 
sure it might be easier to go for those
crazy<00:01:36.450> flashy<00:01:36.869> plays<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> long<00:01:38.700> haul

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
crazy flashy plays but in the long haul

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
crazy flashy plays but in the long haul
it<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.479> us<00:01:39.630> kid<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.320> easier<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.860> punish

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it makes us kid a lot easier to punish

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
it makes us kid a lot easier to punish
since<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.790> he<00:01:41.909> ever<00:01:42.119> waste<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.930> w<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.500> any<00:01:43.680> point

just go from and punish him really
really<00:01:51.060> hard<00:01:51.270> because<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.750> slows<00:01:51.930> himself<00:01:52.530> now

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
down completely this change is actually

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
down completely this change is actually
really<00:02:03.000> awesome<00:02:03.540> since<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.259> buffs<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
really awesome since with the buffs and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
really awesome since with the buffs and
previous<00:02:05.159> patches<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.509> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
previous patches I think this is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.089 
previous patches I think this is
actually<00:02:06.840> enough<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.439> him<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.770> played<00:02:07.979> at

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
actually enough for him to be played at

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.010 
actually enough for him to be played at
the<00:02:08.160> competitive<00:02:08.459> level<00:02:08.849> his<00:02:09.450> current<00:02:09.840> major

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the competitive level his current major

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
the competitive level his current major
problem<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.739> mana<00:02:10.950> costs<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> only

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
problem of mana costs is really the only

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.040 
problem of mana costs is really the only
thing<00:02:12.660> hold

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
thing hold

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.050 
thing hold
back<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:13.860> with<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.580> should<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.820> good

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
back and so with this he should be good

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.880 
back and so with this he should be good
to<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.600> becomes<00:02:15.900> quite<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> bit<00:02:16.560> stronger

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
to go and becomes quite a bit stronger

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.980 
to go and becomes quite a bit stronger

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
reasonably high amount we can definitely

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
reasonably high amount we can definitely
expect<00:02:26.730> her<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.970> start<00:02:27.240> making<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> comeback

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
good item builds to take but I'm sure

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.070 
good item builds to take but I'm sure
someone<00:02:35.700> will<00:02:35.880> find<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.330> way<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.540> make<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.780> work

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
someone will find a way to make it work

since<00:02:37.440> overall<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:37.980> buff<00:02:38.190> helps<00:02:38.580> or<00:02:38.730> clear

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
since overall this buff helps or clear

since overall this buff helps or clear
speed<00:02:39.330> especially<00:02:40.020> early<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.770> by<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> really

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
speed especially early on by a really

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.760 
speed especially early on by a really
nice<00:02:42.030> amount<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:42.990> actually<00:02:43.260> think<00:02:43.590> it's

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
nice amount so I actually think it's

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.320 
nice amount so I actually think it's
enough<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.070> Evelyn<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.610> start<00:02:44.850> being<00:02:45.060> played

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
enough for Evelyn to start being played

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.940 
enough for Evelyn to start being played
again<00:02:45.630> whether<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.500> we'll<00:02:46.680> see<00:02:46.830> her<00:02:46.920> in

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
again whether or not we'll see her in

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
again whether or not we'll see her in
competitive<00:02:47.580> time<00:02:48.150> will<00:02:48.360> tell<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:49.350> for<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.770> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
competitive time will tell but for now I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.470 
competitive time will tell but for now I
think<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.250> soloqueue<00:02:50.700> she's<00:02:50.910> definitely<00:02:51.330> once

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
think in soloqueue she's definitely once

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.700 
think in soloqueue she's definitely once
again<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.990> pretty<00:02:52.320> powerful<00:02:52.500> pic<00:02:54.170> fizz<00:02:55.170> also

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
again a pretty powerful pic fizz also

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.770 
again a pretty powerful pic fizz also
had<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> shift<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.340> damage<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.760> his<00:02:56.850> W<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.570> now

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780

had a shift in damage on his W it's now
more<00:02:58.050> about<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.410> passive<00:02:58.920> damage<00:02:59.220> over<00:02:59.430> time

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
more about the passive damage over time

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.970 
more about the passive damage over time
rather<00:02:59.670> than<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.360> active<00:03:00.840> damage<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:01.770> this

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
rather than the active damage now this

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.790 
rather than the active damage now this
is<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> nerf<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.610> deef<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.270> but<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> buff<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.260> AP

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.340 
is a nerf to a deef is but a buff to AP
phys<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.460> although<00:03:05.670> i<00:03:06.000> still<00:03:06.090> think<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.900> beef<00:03:07.140> is

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
phys so although i still think a beef is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.530 
phys so although i still think a beef is
we'll<00:03:07.560> definitely<00:03:07.920> still<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.460> good<00:03:08.670> consider

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
we'll definitely still be good consider

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.490 
we'll definitely still be good consider
trying<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.350> beef<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.800> once<00:03:11.100> again<00:03:12.500> karen

Ultimates<00:03:15.780> reduced<00:03:16.110> by<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> pretty<00:03:16.770> reasonable

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
Ultimates reduced by a pretty reasonable

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.460

amount<00:03:17.700> long<00:03:18.360> ultimate<00:03:18.840> cooldowns<00:03:19.200> were<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
amount long ultimate cooldowns were a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
amount long ultimate cooldowns were a
big<00:03:19.680> problem<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.250> them<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:20.730> buff<00:03:20.910> was

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
big problem for them so this buff was

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.850 
big problem for them so this buff was
definitely<00:03:21.630> something<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.080> needed<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.680> is

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
definitely something they needed and is

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.140 
definitely something they needed and is
potentially<00:03:23.459> enough<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:23.820> them<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.060> be

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

reduced<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:32.400> actually<00:03:32.610> makes<00:03:32.910> her<00:03:33.090> quite<00:03:33.420> a

reduced this actually makes her quite a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.510 
reduced this actually makes her quite a
bit<00:03:33.720> less<00:03:33.930> tanky<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.980> reasonably

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
bit less tanky and so is reasonably

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.940 
bit less tanky and so is reasonably
significant<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.720> she<00:03:36.780> has<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.110> much<00:03:37.470> clearer

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
significant now she has a much clearer

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.560 
significant now she has a much clearer
weakness<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:38.970> punished<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
weakness that can be punished in the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.870 
weakness that can be punished in the
game<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.770> great<00:03:40.920> change<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.670> tame

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
game and so it's a great change to tame

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.050 
game and so it's a great change to tame
the<00:03:42.120> beasts<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.660> jungle<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.970> moving<00:03:44.970> on

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the beasts of the jungle and moving on

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.000 
the beasts of the jungle and moving on
to<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.239> item<00:03:45.600> changes<00:03:45.750> cinderhulk<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:46.739> gives

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
to the item changes cinderhulk now gives

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.180 
to the item changes cinderhulk now gives
50<00:03:47.430> less<00:03:47.640> health<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.209> costs<00:03:48.690> 40<00:03:49.260> more<00:03:49.440> gold<00:03:49.800> so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
50 less health and costs 40 more gold so

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.250 
50 less health and costs 40 more gold so
a<00:03:50.220> reasonably<00:03:51.000> big<00:03:51.209> nerf<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> item

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
a reasonably big nerf to the item

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.530 
a reasonably big nerf to the item
although<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.130> was<00:03:53.310> kind<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.730> overpowered<00:03:54.330> so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
although it was kind of overpowered so

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.390 
although it was kind of overpowered so
it<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:54.720> definitely<00:03:54.989> deserved<00:03:55.590> I'm<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.920> little

it is definitely deserved I'm a little
sad<00:03:56.550> with<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:56.970> change<00:03:57.239> since<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.840> nerf
