really<00:00:09.780> that's<00:00:10.200> fairly<00:00:10.440> time-consuming<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
really that's fairly time-consuming a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.680 
really that's fairly time-consuming a
couple<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> days<00:00:11.940> yeah<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> couple<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.570> days

couple of days yeah a couple of days

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.120 
couple of days yeah a couple of days
believe<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.469> not<00:00:13.530> that's<00:00:13.679> nothing

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
believe it or not that's nothing

believe it or not that's nothing
compared<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> seems<00:00:15.299> wrong<00:00:15.480> saying

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
compared to and it seems wrong saying

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
Renault Megane I like to think that if

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.849 
Renault Megane I like to think that if
something<00:00:20.730> goes<00:00:21.090> wrong<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:21.779> car<00:00:22.109> wow<00:00:22.529> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
can probably fix it myself it's one of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
can probably fix it myself it's one of
the<00:00:25.590> joys<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.980> car<00:00:26.220> ownership<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:27.420> immense

well<00:01:00.540> that's<00:01:00.960> unfortunately<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.130> you've

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
well that's unfortunately what you've

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.390 
well that's unfortunately what you've
got<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.700> if<00:01:03.150> you're<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> McGann<00:01:03.810> owner<00:01:04.400> but

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
harder to get to I think that it's barmy

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.380 
harder to get to I think that it's barmy
here's<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.950> Volkswagen<00:01:56.460> Golf<00:01:56.610> fan<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.270> like

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
here's a Volkswagen Golf fan just like

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
here's a Volkswagen Golf fan just like
them<00:01:57.600> again<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.020> too<00:01:58.409> has<00:01:58.680> five<00:01:59.010> stars<00:01:59.310> for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
them again it too has five stars for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.750 
them again it too has five stars for
safety<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> reckon<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.400> bulb<00:02:02.610> in

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
safety now I reckon that the bulb in

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.040 
safety now I reckon that the bulb in
this<00:02:02.880> skull<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.300> be<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:03.600> easier<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
this skull would be a lot easier to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.510 
this skull would be a lot easier to
change<00:02:04.080> than<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.860> McGann<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.400> I've

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
change than in the McGann so I've

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.540 
change than in the McGann so I've
