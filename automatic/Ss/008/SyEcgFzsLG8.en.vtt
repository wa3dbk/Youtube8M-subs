 Are you going to install it? 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 usually this is the system it goes 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.049
 alert the following notification to the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.979
 google recommends that you are not in this 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.409
 application because it contains vim codes 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.720
 with the intention of circumventing the protections of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.229

 usb debugging a ok beauty 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:12.290
 I come here and open the application is 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.709
 to allow 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.819
 can be and here is a simple application 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.769
 and the button here does not know the translation 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.969

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.810
 power 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.159
 my dear tegra night remembering that 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.489
 the version of android to 4.4.2 kitkat be 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.489
 whatever god 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.790
 wait 15 seconds to start your 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.870
 tablet your device 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.329
 Let's wait here Countdown 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.829
 anxious my lustral god will be that I 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.829
 to succeed will work out 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:08.870
 well he has restarted and now we're going 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.209
 see if he really did cut the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.340
 gradient taigra note that as far as I 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.139
 I choose to have no tutorial 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.419
 in Portuguese 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.209
 sectoral programs in English that have 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.849
 hard to understand for more than you 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.299
 translate there really is a little 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.609
 complicated to understand the tutorial 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.489
 so I preferred not to risk preferring 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:36.199
 stay with my tegra without ruth until 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:41.329
 a shape appears until a 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:43.819
 sure way to do my dear friend 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.379
 Anderson said he was 100% 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.859
 functional 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.569
 So I'll believe his word and 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.459
 so far so I 'm seeing here 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.099
 it's working 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.489
 the application said that restarting it 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:02.900
 started now I'll wait for him to load 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:06.349
 install the super super south that is the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:12.790
 rudi management application and 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:21.289
 I'll see how effective the process is. 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:23.900
 so wait good start as you guys 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.020

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:11.669
 prove the veracity of the tutorial I 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.319
 I found the teacher basic 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.629
 he will simply check if it will be 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.029
 possible if your device has 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.639
