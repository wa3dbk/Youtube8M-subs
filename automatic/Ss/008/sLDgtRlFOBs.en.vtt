looks a lot less for some reason guys

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.080 
looks a lot less for some reason guys
moving<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.830> last<00:02:29.069> trade<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:29.819> set

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
moving on to the last trade of this set

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.449 
moving on to the last trade of this set
and<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.599> another<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.080> run<00:02:31.280> free<00:02:32.280> back

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and it is another to run free back

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.330 
and it is another to run free back
formation<00:02:33.000> again<00:02:33.230> 16<00:02:34.230> Kyle<00:02:34.470> pay<00:02:34.709> for<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.069> one

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
formation again 16 Kyle pay for this one

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.190 
formation again 16 Kyle pay for this one
and<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.849> all<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.660> 23k

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
and I think all this this one for 23k

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.380 
and I think all this this one for 23k
just<00:02:38.069> because<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.580> had<00:02:38.730> less<00:02:38.910> contracts

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
just because this one had less contracts

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.229 
just because this one had less contracts
under<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.750> offer<00:02:40.019> free<00:02:40.200> back<00:02:40.379> formation<00:02:40.860> one

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
under the offer free back formation one

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.539 
under the offer free back formation one
so<00:02:42.470> would<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:43.709> make<00:02:44.010> quite<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> nice

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
so would you actually make quite a nice

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.220 
so would you actually make quite a nice
profit<00:02:44.849> for<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.269> set<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.540> trades<00:02:45.780> guys<00:02:46.079> I
