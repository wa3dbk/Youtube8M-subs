00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and I'm just going to lay that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.500 
and I'm just going to lay that
criss-crossing<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.130> first<00:01:30.400> one<00:01:30.640> we<00:01:30.790> did<00:01:33.510> feel

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
criss-crossing the first one we did feel

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.880 
criss-crossing the first one we did feel
like<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.900> need<00:01:35.230> to<00:01:35.350> make<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> little
