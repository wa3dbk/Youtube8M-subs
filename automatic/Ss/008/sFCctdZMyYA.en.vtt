00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.030
 or should you throw when you arrive because 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.339
 just bought so I hope there's 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.659
 come let's look for it and once you 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.999
 let's have the vehicle, I'll teach it to 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.700
 see to see how it runs let's try to 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.720
 look at how fast you have in acceleration 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.970
 we can look also 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.380
 what we have in the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.270
 short course although much fury measurement 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.010
 because it tells us how many courses 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 well if I say man what happens that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.000
 I still do not have to have any 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.130
 vehicle but as soon as it goes you know that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.540
 it's telling us the custom saints do not 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.490
 does it mean well I always say the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.530
 holy courses seem very good to me 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.060
 name so let's go see if the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.040
 vehicle is already available here 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.570
 low of the vehicle bat negaba we leave 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.700
 the car here and we're going to go by our 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 vehicle that must be found in the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.320
 apartment number 35 I'm wrong ok 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.119
 let's try if you are here if you are not 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.260
 let's wait for it to arrive or we will 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.750
 another apartment I think I've 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.820
 put in here I do not know if I'll have been wrong 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.340
 let's try that no eyes 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.770
 we have here in green, how are you? 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.140
 seeing the vehicle is pretty cool 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.640
 that is, the color is the most beautiful but 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.619
 we could go to paint what we could 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.450
 I do not know if you want to put it on me 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.670
 the comments were and Tunisia alone 2.0 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.650
 could bring a tuned in 2.0 but 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.600
 let's go paint we 're going to put 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.580
 another color as you are seeing the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.679
 vehicle is very cool because it runs 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.060
 pretty much I do not know if it runs as much as 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.070
 the sidewalk as slow but we could 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.300
 do a speed test apparently in 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.730
 the curve 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.130
 pretty good good good this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.960
 car can be very bad to see this car 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.970
 it can be very bad so what are we going 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.560
 to do is to put it in the saints 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.900
 let's change the color for now 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.020
 I'm going to teach it because guys in the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.470
 race or games with this stroller 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.810
 eyes like this strollers that telita 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 telita with the pegas and osiris as 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.040
 I packed a super vehicle that got up to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.720
 the doors and on the top is worth 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.480
 here we are having the repairs I am going to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.460
 change only the color the paint 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.910
 here main color we are going to put 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.070
 eye in chromed god of love almodóvar 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.930
 we are going to put a colored metallic 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.930
 let's see what color we put red 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 how it looks teri red does not seem right 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.880
 It was not perfect, we give it a red 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.830
 Ferrari is worth the face of us here 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.890
 let's put and the secondary also 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.960
 red torino if we have it here eye 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.590
 the color that can be put on it because 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.640
 can fly a lot is this color I think 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.750
 that an orange hits pretty well 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.910
 now the orange come a yellow game 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.730
 green come this color that what was 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.950
 this pretty affine south midnight worth 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.660
 we're going to go out and we're going to 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.520
 show it inside so you can see it 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.410
 It's worth it because the Scotsman is very cool 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.240
 as you are seeing any color is left 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.680
 Pretty nice man instead of 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.300

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.250

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.530

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.320

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.700
 Yes, it skids the eye with the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.560
 vehicle that I think this car 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.420
 tuned in career can fly a lot 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.550
