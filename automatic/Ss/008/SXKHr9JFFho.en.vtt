this<00:00:14.590> thing<00:00:14.770> does

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.190 

all<00:00:36.280> right<00:00:36.640> there<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:37.540> math<00:00:37.720> and<00:00:37.930> see<00:00:38.050> if<00:00:38.110> she

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
all right there the math and see if she

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.600 
all right there the math and see if she
does<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:41.260> right<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:41.650> came<00:00:41.830> back<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.280> here<00:00:42.489> to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
does all right I came back in here to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.870 
does all right I came back in here to
find<00:00:42.820> out<00:00:43.000> what<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.239> wattage<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.690> my<00:00:43.840> amp<00:00:43.989> is

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
find out what the wattage of my amp is

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.229 
find out what the wattage of my amp is
the<00:00:45.880> voltage<00:00:46.420> output<00:00:47.020> of<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:48.670> speaker<00:00:48.940> leads

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
the voltage output of my speaker leads

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.610 
the voltage output of my speaker leads
is<00:00:49.510> 81<00:00:50.110> volts<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.720> times<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.199> by<00:00:53.559> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
is 81 volts on the times that by the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.570 
is 81 volts on the times that by the
amperage<00:00:54.930> coming<00:00:55.930> out<00:00:56.080> of<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.320> speaker<00:00:57.309> leads

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
amperage coming out of the speaker leads

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.750 
amperage coming out of the speaker leads
which<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.000> 61<00:00:58.510> amps<00:00:59.250> which<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.400> going<00:01:00.580> to<00:01:00.640> give

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
which is 61 amps which is going to give

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.759 
which is 61 amps which is going to give
me<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:00.940> total<00:01:01.150> wattage<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.870> four<00:01:02.170> thousand

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
me the total wattage of four thousand

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.499 
me the total wattage of four thousand
nine<00:01:02.890> hundred<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.790> forty-one<00:01:04.030> watts

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
nine hundred and forty-one watts

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.030 
nine hundred and forty-one watts
that's<00:01:07.509> added<00:01:07.960> peanut<00:01:08.229> rise<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:09.360> 1.3<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.830> do

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
that's added peanut rise of 1.3 to do

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.590 
that's added peanut rise of 1.3 to do
the<00:01:12.190> math<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.520> figure<00:01:12.640> that<00:01:12.910> out<00:01:13.119> basically

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
the math to figure that out basically

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.400 
the math to figure that out basically
what<00:01:13.690> you're<00:01:13.780> going<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:13.960> do<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.290> you're<00:01:14.380> going

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.660 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:14.530> do<00:01:14.680> your<00:01:14.920> wattage<00:01:15.660> which<00:01:16.660> is<00:01:16.810> 81<00:01:17.290> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to do your wattage which is 81 and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.820 
to do your wattage which is 81 and
you're<00:01:18.670> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.910> divide<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.630> by<00:01:19.830> your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
you're going to divide that by your

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.760 
you're going to divide that by your
voltage<00:01:21.550> or<00:01:22.270> sorry<00:01:22.570> your<00:01:22.780> amperage<00:01:23.110> output

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
voltage or sorry your amperage output

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.630 
voltage or sorry your amperage output
which<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.610> going<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.940> be<00:01:25.030> 61<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:27.250> will<00:01:27.460> give

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
which is going to be 61 this will give

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.609 
which is going to be 61 this will give
you<00:01:27.789> your<00:01:28.000> impedance<00:01:28.450> rise<00:01:28.660> which<00:01:29.050> is<00:01:29.229> mine<00:01:29.440> is

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
you your impedance rise which is mine is

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.480 
you your impedance rise which is mine is
that<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.860> looks<00:01:29.979> at<00:01:30.190> one<00:01:30.460> point<00:01:30.640> three<00:01:30.970> two<00:01:32.490> but

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
that it looks at one point three two but

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.430 
that it looks at one point three two but
doing<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.820> math<00:01:34.030> like<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.840> said<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.200> it's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
doing the math like I said it's it's

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.940 
doing the math like I said it's it's
pretty<00:01:35.770> efficient<00:01:36.310> amp<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.810> rated<00:01:38.140> at<00:01:38.229> 5000

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
pretty efficient amp it is rated at 5000

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.560 
pretty efficient amp it is rated at 5000
watts<00:01:39.130> but<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.610> said<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.970> impedance<00:01:40.330> riders

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
watts but like said the impedance riders

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.109 
watts but like said the impedance riders
at<00:01:40.689> one<00:01:40.840> point<00:01:41.080> three<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.610> little<00:01:43.000> bit

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
at one point three it's a little bit

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.609 
at one point three it's a little bit
higher<00:01:43.360> than<00:01:43.540> what<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.840> ape<00:01:44.140> requires

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
higher than what the ape requires

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.190 
higher than what the ape requires
because<00:01:45.040> it's<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.310> one<00:01:45.490> ohm<00:01:45.640> stable<00:01:46.090> amp<00:01:46.330> but

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
because it's a one ohm stable amp but

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.380 
because it's a one ohm stable amp but
it's<00:01:47.320> not<00:01:47.439> bad<00:01:47.680> start<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:48.280> for<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.670> point<00:01:49.000> six

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
it's not bad start now for the point six

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's not bad start now for the point six
impedance<00:01:50.939> rising<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> one<00:01:52.360> point<00:01:52.390> three<00:01:52.960> so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
impedance rising to a one point three so

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.109 
impedance rising to a one point three so
that's<00:01:53.439> not<00:01:53.650> too<00:01:53.860> bad<00:01:54.070> for<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.369> app<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.850> still

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
that's not too bad for that app I still

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:04.630 
that's not too bad for that app I still
got<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.299> couple<00:01:55.479> more<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.720> go

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
