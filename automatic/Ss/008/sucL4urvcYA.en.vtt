00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
have your stocks and then one thing that

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.960 
have your stocks and then one thing that
stands<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.799> your<00:02:40.980> different<00:02:41.250> camos<00:02:41.640> as

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
stands it out is your different camos as

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.520 
stands it out is your different camos as
you<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.299> at<00:02:43.170> least<00:02:44.269> 30<00:02:45.269> plus<00:02:45.659> camos<00:02:46.139> which

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
color duty has nothing on with there I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.839 
color duty has nothing on with there I
think<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.829> eight<00:02:50.239> seven<00:02:51.239> or<00:02:51.329> eight<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:52.849> mean

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
think it's eight seven or eight I mean

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.780 
think it's eight seven or eight I mean
it's<00:02:54.299> just<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:55.170> whole<00:02:55.620> lot<00:02:55.650> deeper<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.670> not

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
it's just a whole lot deeper it's not

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.349 
it's just a whole lot deeper it's not
the<00:02:56.909> fact<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.389> only<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:58.280> your<00:02:59.359> five

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
the fact that you only have your five

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.940 
the fact that you only have your five
primary<00:03:01.019> weapons<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:01.829> then<00:03:02.819> your<00:03:03.090> your<00:03:03.659> three

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
primary weapons and then your your three

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.500 
primary weapons and then your your three
secondaries<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.280> then<00:03:06.060> another<00:03:06.299> feature

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
secondaries and then another feature

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.050 
secondaries and then another feature
that's<00:03:06.720> rather<00:03:07.650> innovative<00:03:07.889> is<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.549> weapon

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
that's rather innovative is the weapon
