the science give us the power but it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.700 
the science give us the power but it

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.010 

I've<00:01:06.710> been<00:01:06.920> confused<00:01:07.400> about<00:01:07.490> technology<00:01:08.299> I've

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
I've been confused about technology I've

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.719 
I've been confused about technology I've
heard<00:01:09.200> all<00:01:09.380> my<00:01:09.560> life<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.100> technologies

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
heard all my life that technologies

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.760 
heard all my life that technologies
themselves<00:01:10.970> are<00:01:11.479> neutral<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.620> all

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
themselves are neutral that it all

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.100 
themselves are neutral that it all
depends<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.280> how<00:01:13.340> we<00:01:13.520> use<00:01:13.790> them<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.750> they<00:01:14.930> can

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
depends on how we use them that they can

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.560 
depends on how we use them that they can
be<00:01:15.229> used<00:01:15.500> for<00:01:15.830> good<00:01:15.860> or<00:01:16.070> ill<00:01:16.430> depending<00:01:17.420> on<00:01:17.420> the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
be used for good or ill depending on the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.410 
be used for good or ill depending on the
wisdom<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:18.140> intelligence<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.070> user<00:01:19.420> but

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
wisdom and intelligence of the user but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.050 
wisdom and intelligence of the user but
his<00:01:20.930> gerrymander<00:01:21.680> explains<00:01:22.159> but<00:01:22.850> that's

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
his gerrymander explains but that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.630 
his gerrymander explains but that's
completely<00:01:23.479> wrong<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.500> can<00:01:24.680> do<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:24.979> you<00:01:25.610> can

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
completely wrong you can do it you can

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.789 
completely wrong you can do it you can
do<00:01:25.850> an<00:01:25.970> analysis<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.600> every<00:01:26.930> technology<00:01:27.320> and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
do an analysis of every technology and

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.280 
do an analysis of every technology and
find<00:01:28.100> its<00:01:29.770> beneficial<00:01:30.770> aspects<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.290> it's

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
find its beneficial aspects and it's

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.640 
find its beneficial aspects and it's
negative<00:01:33.710> aspects<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.270> idea<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:35.780> it's<00:01:36.439> just

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
negative aspects the idea that it's just

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.310 
negative aspects the idea that it's just
about<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.250> way<00:01:37.400> we<00:01:37.430> use<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.320> absurd

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
about the way we use it is absurd

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.770 
about the way we use it is absurd
because<00:01:39.530> these<00:01:40.100> are<00:01:40.280> built-in<00:01:40.780> built-in

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
because these are built-in built-in

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.190 
because these are built-in built-in
factors<00:01:42.640> as<00:01:43.640> an<00:01:43.880> example<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.810> difference

factors as an example the difference
between<00:01:45.350> nuclear<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.159> solar<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.700> more<00:01:47.090> than

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
between nuclear and solar is more than

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.230 
between nuclear and solar is more than
in<00:01:47.420> how<00:01:47.540> we<00:01:47.600> use<00:01:47.930> them<00:01:48.220> each<00:01:49.220> technology<00:01:49.729> has

in how we use them each technology has

in how we use them each technology has
