00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello talkative community how are you in 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.209
 this opportunity I am going to talk to you about 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.250
 kurt of the most popular supplements and 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.760
 effective that exist I'm 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.529
 referring to fish as systems 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.960
 investigating the plan giving 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.560
 mind that there is great information 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.390
 available also that this one that 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.519
 contradicts one another can you 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.500
 be confusing so what are we going to 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.300
 do in this video is that I 'm going to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.260
 explain in the simplest way 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.930
 possible 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.719
 you can benefit from great mean of that 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.420
 supplement and see if it is necessary for you 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.559
 right now or not 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.559
 ok is ready 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.060
 the fish or also called amino acids 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.880
 branched chain leucine isoleucine 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.760
 and Valina there are two big minds in winning 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.890
 muscle mass burn fat in strength 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 and in recovery so you have 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.000
 all this well let's go step by step 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.510
 the proteins are made of 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.330
 amino acids which are 20 in total and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.910
 these stimulate protein synthesis 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.640
 muscles which leads to 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.150
 muscle growth to hypertrophy ok 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.690
 and just in spite of the power plant and 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.420
 solution and valina make up a third 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.229
 of the total amino acids in the muscles 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 so look out there also the bce a leucine 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.080
 is the one that stimulates the synthesis much more 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.280
 of muscle proteins there is no 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.850
 another amino acid that is compared 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 that is to say that the quantity of medicines 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.509
 what's in each protein source 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.840
 determines how anabolic is said 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.720
 food if a protein source has 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.180
 high amounts of the plant is going to 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.060
 help greatly to achieve results 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.880
 that seeks to get in your body if a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.330
 food contains low amounts of 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.050
 leucine you're practically losing the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.160
 time remember for maximum results 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.780
 in less time you should eat 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.269
 smartly it is not eating to eat 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.400
 so in a moment we're also going to 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.010
 reveal what foods to 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.459
 they contain high amounts of medicines 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.040
 so that your consumption also increases 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.620
 another important factor is that the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.480
 desired are going to help you get the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.569
 maximum benefit to the trainings 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.880
 They are easily used as 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.460
 fuel so you'll have more 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.240
 decreased energy your fatigue 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.490
 and you can train harder also helps 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.770
 to decrease muscle pain what 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.630
 which helps you recover faster from 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.220
 the trainings and if you take time 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.580
 following other videos you know that the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.070
 Recovery is essential if you're looking 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.880
 transform your physique has been proven 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.060
 also also that the beasts help in 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.680
 fat burning also elevates 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.350
 testosterone levels which is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.960
 fundamental is to say the fish can 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.170
 be used either in volume phase 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.230
 in the definition phase ok is very effective 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.320
 as you can see and it is natural now 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.950
 big question is necessary for you in 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.170
 these moments if you are one year old 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.450
 more training and feeding 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 correctly is a supplement that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.790
 I definitely recommend using it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.400
 how do you know it bigger 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.360
 and heights excellent results in your 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.819
 body 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.859
 now for maximum results and this 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.170
 advice for even for those who 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:53.620
 today for the first time in their think 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.829
 training is to eat food with 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.439
 high unwanted content for example 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:05.829
 carmen red eggs almonds fish 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.689
 lentils liver chickpeas incorporate 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.450
 these foods in your diet theme help 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.730
 enough in your present objectives 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.400
 besides that the beasts are amino acids 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.310
 essential that means that in your 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.729
 body can not produce them so 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.460
 which you must ingest either through 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.430
 the food or in supplements how to use 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.000
 a supplement of times the days that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.000
 you train consumes 5 to 10 grams before 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.009
 train and 5 to 10 grams after 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.410
 train the days you do not train 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.030
 consume those two shots that I just 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.660
 comment separately 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.750
 between meals for better absorption 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.020
 since you can do every day is to 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.510
 get up to consume fish because 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.120
 it absorbs much faster than food and 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.320
 so feed this immediate to your 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.490
 muscles ok 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.870
 equal 5 to 10 grams should be well century 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.090
 that are for all the video of the day of 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.160
