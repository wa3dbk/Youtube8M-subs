Marguerite let's get started with the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.010 
Marguerite let's get started with the
dough<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:46.090> I<00:00:46.120> have<00:00:46.300> three<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.630> half<00:00:46.720> cups<00:00:46.930> of

middle of that about a cup and a quarter
of<00:00:51.940> blood<00:00:52.870> temperature<00:00:53.710> water<00:00:53.890> let's<00:00:54.250> just

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
of blood temperature water let's just

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.720 
of blood temperature water let's just
say<00:00:54.610> somewhere<00:00:55.030> between<00:00:55.320> 96<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.530> 98<00:00:56.890> point<00:00:57.370> 6

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
then I'm going to take my yeast and I'm

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.930 
then I'm going to take my yeast and I'm
going<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.050> mix<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.130> one<00:01:03.400> package

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
going to mix that in that is one package

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.530 
going to mix that in that is one package
of<00:01:04.500> active<00:01:05.500> dry<00:01:05.950> yeast<00:01:05.979> I<00:01:06.610> want<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.940> start<00:01:07.240> that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
sugar allow it to just sit there for a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.250 
sugar allow it to just sit there for a
second<00:01:13.210> I'm<00:01:13.300> going<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.480> add<00:01:13.630> about<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.930> quarter

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
second I'm going to add about a quarter

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.570 
second I'm going to add about a quarter
cup<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:15.460> extra<00:01:16.030> virgin<00:01:16.060> olive<00:01:16.480> well<00:01:17.580> after

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
about 30 seconds you'll see that the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.990 
about 30 seconds you'll see that the
yeast<00:01:20.200> starts<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.710> bubble<00:01:20.890> up<00:01:21.100> that's<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.820> key

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
yeast starts to bubble up that's the key

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.510 
yeast starts to bubble up that's the key
once<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:22.870> happens<00:01:23.260> I<00:01:23.610> stir<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.640> all<00:01:25.030> in<00:01:26.520> when

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
once that happens I stir it all in when

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.830 
once that happens I stir it all in when

I'm<00:01:45.150> getting<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> massive<00:01:45.750> upper<00:01:46.320> body<00:01:46.590> workout

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I'm getting a massive upper body workout

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
I'm getting a massive upper body workout
right<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:48.360> can't<00:01:48.630> measure<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.050> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
right now you can't measure this you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.570 
right now you can't measure this you
can't<00:01:49.440> do<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> gym<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.370> really

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
can't do this in the gym and it really

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.130 
can't do this in the gym and it really
doesn't<00:01:50.820> make<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.940> difference<00:01:51.330> when<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.050> get

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
doesn't make a difference when you get

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.420 
doesn't make a difference when you get
to<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.380> point<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.770> feels<00:01:52.920> almost<00:01:53.220> like

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
to the point where it feels almost like

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.880 
to the point where it feels almost like

this is easy the pro tip here is to make

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.940 
this is easy the pro tip here is to make
sure<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> don't<00:02:19.380> tear<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.709> don't<00:02:19.830> want

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
sure that you don't tear you don't want

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.949 
sure that you don't tear you don't want
to<00:02:20.010> stretch<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.400> too<00:02:20.520> thin<00:02:20.760> although<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
to stretch it too thin although it's a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.020 
to stretch it too thin although it's a
little<00:02:22.230> Guido<00:02:22.440> throwing<00:02:23.340> pizza<00:02:23.640> actually

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
little Guido throwing pizza actually

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360 
little Guido throwing pizza actually
gives<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> best<00:02:24.660> way<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.260> extending<00:02:26.100> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
gives you the best way of extending that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.070 
gives you the best way of extending that
without<00:02:26.820> pushing<00:02:27.120> your<00:02:27.390> fingers<00:02:27.780> through<00:02:27.959> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
without pushing your fingers through it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.949 
without pushing your fingers through it
so<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.800> reason<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.130> exists<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
so that's the reason it exists but the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.110 
so that's the reason it exists but the
real<00:02:34.260> trick<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.880> show

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

medium high you just drop it on like
that<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.950> by<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.100> time<00:02:47.190> we<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.790> the

that and then by the time we get to the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.100 
that and then by the time we get to the
