00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
bit but made a mistake coming onto and

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.059 
bit but made a mistake coming onto and
hit<00:04:06.000> those<00:04:06.150> bumps<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.750> spun<00:04:07.019> up<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.349> lost<00:04:07.920> a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
hit those bumps and spun up and lost a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.319 
hit those bumps and spun up and lost a
lot<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.250> momentum<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.760> he<00:04:08.849> pulled<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.239> me

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
lot of momentum and he pulled for me

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.580 
lot of momentum and he pulled for me
that<00:04:09.510> was<00:04:09.599> my<00:04:09.780> only<00:04:09.900> chance<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.470> him

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.409 

Kenny<00:06:39.110> he<00:06:39.319> came<00:06:39.560> by<00:06:39.830> when<00:06:40.819> I<00:06:40.879> was<00:06:41.090> running<00:06:41.300> the

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
Kenny he came by when I was running the

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.899 
Kenny he came by when I was running the
third<00:06:41.930> put<00:06:42.830> me<00:06:42.979> in<00:06:43.069> the<00:06:43.159> fourth<00:06:43.430> and<00:06:43.669> I<00:06:43.699> should

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
third put me in the fourth and I should

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.129 
third put me in the fourth and I should
have<00:06:44.030> dropped<00:06:44.240> down<00:06:44.389> on<00:06:44.599> the<00:06:44.659> groover<00:06:45.080> a

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
have dropped down on the groover a

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.929 
have dropped down on the groover a
little<00:06:45.349> earlier<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:45.979> followed<00:06:46.340> Kenny<00:06:46.610> cuz<00:06:46.909> I

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
little earlier and followed Kenny cuz I

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.459 
little earlier and followed Kenny cuz I
batted<00:06:47.419> with<00:06:47.449> him<00:06:47.659> a<00:06:47.689> couple<00:06:47.810> laps<00:06:48.110> that<00:06:48.319> he

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.469 
batted with him a couple laps that he

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:51.339 
batted with him a couple laps that he
just<00:06:48.620> kind<00:06:48.770> of<00:06:48.860> took<00:06:49.039> off<00:06:49.900> so<00:06:50.900> I<00:06:50.960> think<00:06:51.050> if<00:06:51.229> I

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
just kind of took off so I think if I

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.779 
just kind of took off so I think if I
would<00:06:51.469> have<00:06:51.530> dropped<00:06:52.009> to<00:06:52.189> the<00:06:52.279> line<00:06:52.460> I<00:06:52.490> ran

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
would have dropped to the line I ran

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.640 
would have dropped to the line I ran
towards<00:06:52.939> the<00:06:53.150> end<00:06:53.240> of<00:06:53.270> the<00:06:53.389> main<00:06:53.509> event<00:06:53.810> we

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
towards the end of the main event we

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.260 
towards the end of the main event we
would<00:06:54.800> have<00:06:54.949> been<00:06:55.430> a<00:06:55.460> little<00:06:55.729> bit<00:06:55.849> better<00:06:56.000> off

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
would have been a little bit better off

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.149 
would have been a little bit better off
but<00:06:56.599> Kenny<00:06:57.229> was<00:06:57.379> on<00:06:57.500> a<00:06:57.529> mission<00:06:57.860> I<00:06:57.919> don't<00:06:57.949> know

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:58.159 
but Kenny was on a mission I don't know

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.980 
but Kenny was on a mission I don't know
if<00:06:58.219> we<00:06:58.310> coulda<00:06:58.490> got<00:06:58.580> Kenny<00:06:58.969> I<00:06:59.090> think<00:06:59.389> we<00:06:59.900> were

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
if we coulda got Kenny I think we were

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.679 
if we coulda got Kenny I think we were
starting<00:07:00.319> to<00:07:00.349> reel<00:07:00.529> in<00:07:00.759> Jake<00:07:01.759> a<00:07:01.789> few<00:07:02.120> laps<00:07:02.330> but

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:02.689

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
still the poet in another third place

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.640 
still the poet in another third place
