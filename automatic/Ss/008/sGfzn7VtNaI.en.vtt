00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.219
 hey people welcome here 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.080
 are closing hardware and software 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.760
 reviews I welcome you here today 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.700
 a new video 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.640
 today it is about memory from the 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.070
 company patriot or petrol in the case 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.880
 here we have the reporters black mamba 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.140
 edition in together 16 gb and like that 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.269
 memory looks like we look 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.250
 here is the packaging for a moment 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.780
 this actually relatively simple and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.269
 simply designed with technical 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.949
 information for example too 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.460
 some cooling through the heat sink 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.770
 Of course, this is the ddr3 we have here 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.079
 Nevertheless, a few more specification 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.170
 but I will not read to you now 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.270
 because we come here directly to the product 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
 Here we have the work 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.450
 storage lock in the unpacked state 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.480
 two pieces of a 8 gigabyte ddr3 is doing now 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.370
 16 gigabytes of RAM for the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.110
 respective computer in which this rule 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.610
 we have more to be installed 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.240
 RAM with a black pcb 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.710
 sent a nice b- 10 cool body 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.720
 Construction with the lettering 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.030
 manufacturer back here we have 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 then technical data so here again 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.570
 the specifications beside in the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.320
 storage capacity 16 gb will be here too 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.140
 still pleasant 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.060
 that is 1600 more than modules are with 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.720
 the a tense time of 10 10 10 27 the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.720
 whole is of course ddr3 memory 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.070
 1 5 volts and of course a kid out 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.740
 two times eight gigabytes 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.549
 as said black pcb is nowadays 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.850
 not to be found eg at corsair 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.439
 the whole thing in green , but yes, me 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.670
 would say it is actually around 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.680
 a lot more beautiful 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 even if the body is on it 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.030
 Heat sinks are slightly higher than in the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 Compare for example to the courses 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.409
 vengeance flow profile 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.590
 otherwise it was for this 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.360
 main memory patriot next black 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.130
 mamba 16 gb ddr3 RAM then 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.810
 Thanks in the first place 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.520
 I would like to comment on that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.930
 rating and lukas subscribe for free 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.670
 useful information is still available in 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.230
 the description again and then see 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.040
 We will benefit again next time 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 and fit
