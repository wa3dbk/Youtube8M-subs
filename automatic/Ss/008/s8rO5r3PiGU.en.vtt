long head lateral head it's right there

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.460 
long head lateral head it's right there
and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> move<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> lateral<00:01:09.240> head

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
and then if you move the lateral head

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.340 
and then if you move the lateral head
that's<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> medial<00:01:11.130> head<00:01:11.930> also<00:01:12.930> when<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that's the medial head also when this is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.289 
that's the medial head also when this is
moved<00:01:13.619> there's<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.250> muscle<00:01:14.490> down<00:01:14.760> here

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
moved there's a little muscle down here

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
moved there's a little muscle down here
that<00:01:15.689> kind<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> frames<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.650> corner<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> his

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that kind of frames the corner of his

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.020 
that kind of frames the corner of his
elbow<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:18.210> called<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> echo<00:01:18.900> Gnaeus<00:01:20.030> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
elbow that's called the echo Gnaeus this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.950 
elbow that's called the echo Gnaeus this
is<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.780> brachialis<00:01:22.170> muscle<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
is your brachialis muscle and then this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680 
is your brachialis muscle and then this
one<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.560> clavicle<00:01:26.009> brachialis

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.980 

if<00:01:29.110> we<00:01:29.230> come<00:01:29.470> on<00:01:29.970> down<00:01:30.970> his<00:01:31.300> arm<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:34.540> muscle

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
if we come on down his arm this muscle

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.090 
if we come on down his arm this muscle
that's<00:01:35.170> loose<00:01:35.580> brachioradialis<00:01:37.650> okay<00:01:38.650> all<00:01:38.890> of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
that's loose brachioradialis okay all of

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.980 
that's loose brachioradialis okay all of
these<00:01:39.250> muscles<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.730> top<00:01:40.000> are<00:01:40.270> extensors

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
these muscles on the top are extensors

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.930 
these muscles on the top are extensors
so<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.800> is<00:01:41.980> your<00:01:42.100> extensor<00:01:42.550> carpi<00:01:42.910> radialis

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
so this is your extensor carpi radialis

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.590 
so this is your extensor carpi radialis
longus<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.920> next<00:01:45.310> one<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.760> your<00:01:46.150> extensor

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
longus the next one is your extensor

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.280 
longus the next one is your extensor
