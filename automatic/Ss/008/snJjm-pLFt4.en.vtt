00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.779
 the importance and oil the machine in 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.900
 this sector affect the machine in this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.900
 sector and in this sector supremely 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.959
 important ok 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.340
 so now if we go back to 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.340
 road that was on this side 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.130
 but how certified 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.780
 missions 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.329
 and good ok 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.329
 then here we have the reel 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.370
 something very important when we go to 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.850
 place the reel but we have it 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.980
 seen that we should be spinning 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.970
 find the hand of the clock and co 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.840
 Right 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.840
 so 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.480
 I have the reel that costs 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.480
 tapita card ok now again 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 we are going to indicate here the cone holder 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.439
 it does not matter how 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.439
 stick on the bandit that explodes 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.360
 and we stopped it here on the ice 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.890
 very important 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.390
 this has the advantage that it is 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.910
 upgradeable then you can 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.930
 locate in any this is important 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.880
 so that they do not have the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.180
 trajectory of the thread is not going to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.780
 tangle here in this after d 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.930
 and there we passed it to this guide and it is very 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.420
 important the bar after entering 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.840
 here 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 then we entered it right here now if 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.290
 we enter through the two tensioning plates and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.500
 we speak up so that the thread 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.310
 is introduced see when what to the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.960
 thread and it moves here the wire milestone 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.430
 this or high and he wants it 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.250
 It was well put then we are still here 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.070
 this part quotes we enter here 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.020
 then here in this sweep that has 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.300
 two rustic ones we put for one because 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.980
 has another tico because these elements 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.050
 They are used to deactivate the machines 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.270
 double needle and therefore comes with 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.440
 those two elements end up inside by 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.600
 here for this part appointment and I download it 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.870
 this side then look here in this comes 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.430
 this tie cited 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.450
 remember we must when we go to 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.890
 manipulate red to chin 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.069
 then the poplars down to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.170
 can open it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.939
 and to close we throw it here do not 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.859
 let's make strength to open it he opens but 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.290
 after splitting a clip here, not a 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:52.040
 piece we do here and we take it to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.930
 get it right then now yes here 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.200
 we have one 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.219
 give a needle a mind what I have for 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.829
 here is an income this needle is very 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.040
 thick is a 138 the screwdriver for 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.040
 favor 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.680
 me with that 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.120
 Well let's see what they're doing 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.120
 video to then reinforce it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.420
 You can take the little one as not 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.420
 security 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.620
 and while I go working and go 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.860
 manipulating the sorcerer who can not 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.860
 to work 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.690
 ah 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.200
 like
