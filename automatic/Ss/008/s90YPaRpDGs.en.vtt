00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.830
 Tunisia Land of beautiful sunsets 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.669
 Land endless wide 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:10.979
 Land of Mountains 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.339
 Aachen and above all 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.109
 Land of the desert 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.939
 The goal of many is to continue even better if you have your own home 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.410
 three of us have another motorhome with alone on land 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.659
 One of these was Hans screaming from Holland and his wife Nancy now building 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.660
 leave because the couple has one 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.340
 Motorhomes for years simply leave while traveling 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.490
 while wanting to travel around the world and thinking, he became the office talent 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.410
 was and then may be 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.380
 but that's a fact percentage of countries to drive from where there are percentages 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.820
 Rainy season there or where it is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 The market is there but can not be questioned 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.220
 so that they can afford it, they have their films and theirs 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.710
 House sold in Holland 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.050
 With the proceeds, they will now realize their great dream and one 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.320
 tough 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.320
 of the vehicle just under 300,000 euros 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.870
 For years, the Dutch couple with Action Mobile in the Austrian 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.680
 Saalfelden talked about the project and planned the construction of the motorhome 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.100
 usually when the customer is ready for the planning and that you are 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.920
 say okay 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.720
 because now it takes care of the realization of the contract is signed then 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.090
 It usually takes one year to nine months to a year this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.590
 Realized is that means we have a pure construction time on a vehicle this 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.840
 Order of magnitude of about three to four months 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 and 2 now knows the high demands of such a service 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.009
 offer the conditions 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.700
 since here too thirty years have lost 3 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.550
 the selected material must be stable the special characteristics at 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.249
 GfK are the ones that are very easy to fix that is 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:02.719
 Percent just in Allrath use in Africa or in Brazil too 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.019
 Example, if the bus is very tight, of course, external injuries 

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:09.979
 Scratches or deeper injuries in GfK can do that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.090
 wonderfully "filling" without any structural error arise here 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.340
 In theory, they can make this body as it stands here in the water 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.470
 sunk and pulled out again and nothing happens that can not concern 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.469
 drink it is absolutely waterproof 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.279
 in this always the last things to install 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.619
 if you build your car then you still have 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.739
 because all are not finished and 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.590
 for example, the perpetrator must still on top of it because he still has to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.700
 be attached that he does not fly out that I just you 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.600
 can take exception 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.629
 not Berbig now 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.359
 Tears so 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.919
 they are beautiful Munich 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.679
 on the way and 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.679
 already done but Martin Kummer York may yes 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.379
 he was a 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.629
 Be careful who the matter but think 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.889
 BZ what or 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.819
 so that's one of our vehicles that's now our home for the next six 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.669
 seven years 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.599
 Warendorf Travel 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.040
 but once I started here we have everything with electricity and water and 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.419
 has to do with percent heating 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.260
 Spira with for example a coffee machine want to criticize Â«We have as 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.559
 So 200 watts supplies just as well Micheel use 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.239
 To learn to cook Szo March to Galler too 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:34.100
 so summarizes that it is not to use who successor as extra work 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.779
 so accept 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.799
 harder too 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.010
 for fresh Breitschuh 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.339
 Nahles 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 and everything nicely grown enough 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.669
 as best firm 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.349
 that does not bother GC needs 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.829
 that was a nice evening that can mean and who is not already 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.819
 We will also be won over these questions 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.779
 Per cent crockery cutlery and everything is installed forest otherwise everything is broken 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:00.960
 again here 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.499
 that you have everything 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:04.480
 can 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.139
 that everything stays the same and that nothing breaks 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.609
 we have our bed 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.469
 he has that too 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.469
 let's do that we have a big roof hatch 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.189
 then sleep under the stars 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.079
 somebody sick is your choice but the stop will be that for the 5 0 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.779
 labeled 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.580
 You do not have one percent in March 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.879
 be private 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.230
 to make banks 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.460
 this service will be better what the market gave up quite openly 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.809
 and then two months 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.809
 Euro accounts said Genscher 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.070
 the one among them is also a castle after all she built a six-cylinder 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.469
 Turbodiesel drives the vehicle present 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.219
 w11 comma 7 tons heavy trucks consumes tons of diesel in the 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:51.439
 Cut about 30 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.590
 16 gears help to tow the truck up the mountain 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.879
 280 hp around 1000 100 kilometers at thousand 500 revolutions per minute 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.689
 The vice is usable even in difficult times 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.909
 the SUV gets a nobler 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.699
 Percent of course we have Baier married the circuit 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.759
 Then we have the opportunity to turn on the reduction percentage 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.969
 Percent then, of course, the barrel is very important and if it is very extreme 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.490
 the name then also here before the possibility the helpers of the lock 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.039
 so enter 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.610
 everything is on the ball 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.080
 even in the foreground 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.080
 House to drive if you value it 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.009
 in Tunisia 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.789
 Dust and sand 40 degrees heat 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.680
 Habitat for Chanel and was on 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.810
 in such real against the best means of transportation 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.740
 the trip to Tunisia serves to make the couple shout 2 relate 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.779
 On the one hand, they want to test their vehicle as new owners and even that 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.169
 Learn to drive off-road 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.470
 on the other hand they see next to individual cities such as the 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:01.819
 petrified those 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.819
 Scene of the movie who does not 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.309
 let the roads in Tunisia apply 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.039
 therefore slowed down 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.439
 Some roads are a difficult topic 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:18.999
 if possible, the question of how quickly disposed of will feel 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.270
 Calls for 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.930
 a in the terrain it could be a bit more but the alternatives are different 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.789
 Car should take and then with 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:41.839
 drive with a wm-use and then not build such a big house 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.219
 then you can drive the workers 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.110
 but which construction start is less normal in the low mountain ranges 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.589
 were the stage or 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.800
 if the track is difficult, take more time for it 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.979
 that is also often quiet were often 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.590
 but because he starts back and then start again so you can with 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:02.150
 The stage is completely different 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.589
 about the content 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.589
 you take over 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.379
 Driving is extremely difficult here 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.379
 small vehicles with openness are 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.779
 the right feeling for the vehicle fell 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:19.179
 not too much but not too little gas otherwise you will get stuck 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.960
 After a few hours has a tangible out 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.690
 it also saw that the car is not at all and what is actually 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.620
 that is legal 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.759
 what could that be 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.289
 Election winner is very extreme percent 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:35.229
 interminable 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:40.740
 Percent Green drive because Albarn "That shows very so Zentgraf this but there 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.460
 heavy op 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.659
 then the twelve tons are how we become with the wintry ones 

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:48.559
 the sandbox games are over 

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:50.889
 most participants would only have their vehicle 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:52.289
 to better handle 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:54.740
 Reward are now the tourist destinations 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.360
 Tunisia has enough of that 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.520
 whether mountain villages like you are hewn retro apartments in the rock or beautiful 

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:06.599
 the journey sounds like it's the beginning of her big screaming 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:07.449
 dream 

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:11.559
 in May 2000 and 7 they will begin their six-year trip around the world
