00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.410 
now here's how I do my roses here's the
back<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:19.000> the<00:00:19.180> rose

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.580 

picked<00:00:26.080> up<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.410> bit<00:00:26.620> more<00:00:26.920> pink<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:29.050> I<00:00:29.080> have<00:00:29.380> some

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
picked up a bit more pink so I have some

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.260 
picked up a bit more pink so I have some
contrast<00:00:30.220> here<00:00:32.190> that<00:00:33.190> is<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.370> very<00:00:33.700> transparent

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
contrast here that is a very transparent

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
contrast here that is a very transparent
color<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.530> if<00:00:35.800> you're<00:00:36.550> painting<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:37.150> against<00:00:37.540> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
color so if you're painting it against a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.510 
color so if you're painting it against a
lighter<00:00:39.850> other<00:00:40.420> colors<00:00:41.020> sometimes<00:00:41.770> it's<00:00:42.250> best

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
lighter other colors sometimes it's best

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.030 
lighter other colors sometimes it's best
to<00:00:42.670> base<00:00:43.059> coat<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.449> shape<00:00:43.930> in<00:00:44.199> there<00:00:44.410> first<00:00:44.830> so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
to base coat a shape in there first so

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.710 
to base coat a shape in there first so
you<00:00:45.160> don't<00:00:45.430> have<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.760> work<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:45.970> hard<00:00:46.480> at

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
you don't have to work so hard at

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.910 
you don't have to work so hard at
covering<00:00:47.170> up<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.530> background<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:50.739> to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
covering up the background I like to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.220 
covering up the background I like to
make<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.280> cup<00:00:51.519> of<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.730> roll<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.210> really<00:00:52.750> big

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
make the cup of the roll is really big

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.310 
make the cup of the roll is really big
I'm<00:00:53.710> adding<00:00:54.220> some<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.449> lighter<00:00:55.690> pink<00:00:56.140> at

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
I'm adding some of the lighter pink at

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.450 
I'm adding some of the lighter pink at
the<00:00:56.350> tip<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.190> will<00:00:57.370> show<00:00:59.070> promised<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.220> red

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
the tip so it will show promised a red

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.579 
the tip so it will show promised a red
roll<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.239> we<00:01:01.449> better<00:01:01.659> have<00:01:01.839> some<00:01:02.110> more<00:01:02.320> red

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
roll is so we better have some more red

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.660 
roll is so we better have some more red
in<00:01:02.800> here<00:01:04.080> red<00:01:05.080> just<00:01:05.350> disappears<00:01:06.130> it's<00:01:06.490> so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
in here red just disappears it's so

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.480 
in here red just disappears it's so
transparent<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.500> an<00:01:14.650> angular<00:01:14.950> shader

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
transparent this is an angular shader

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.570 
transparent this is an angular shader
and<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.120> is<00:01:16.299> really<00:01:16.570> great<00:01:16.900> I<00:01:17.290> saw<00:01:18.010> these<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.400> my

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
and it is really great I saw these on my

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.700 
and it is really great I saw these on my
website<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:22.150> brush<00:01:22.479> really<00:01:22.900> holds<00:01:23.619> a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
website and this brush really holds a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.210 
website and this brush really holds a
lot<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.040> paint<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.960> if<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.500> don't<00:01:26.680> get<00:01:26.890> enough

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
lot of paint see if I don't get enough

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.100 
lot of paint see if I don't get enough
of<00:01:27.400> something<00:01:27.820> I'll<00:01:27.970> go<00:01:28.119> back<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.659> pick<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.960> up

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
of something I'll go back and pick it up

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.730 
of something I'll go back and pick it up
I<00:01:29.320> needed<00:01:29.619> more<00:01:29.799> red<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:31.329> a<00:01:31.359> diagonal<00:01:31.899> stroke

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740

across here add another petal here on
the<00:01:38.829> side<00:01:39.100> just<00:01:39.460> somewhere<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.740> I'm<00:01:41.950> going

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
the side just somewhere as I'm going

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.550 
the side just somewhere as I'm going
along<00:01:42.549> if<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:43.060> don't<00:01:43.299> like<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.899> way<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.259> stroke

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
along if I don't like the way the stroke

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.219 
along if I don't like the way the stroke
is<00:01:44.799> I'll<00:01:45.039> go<00:01:45.219> back<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.820> shape<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.049> bit

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
is I'll go back and shape it a bit

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.279 
is I'll go back and shape it a bit
better<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:49.119> using<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.659> tip<00:01:49.899> of<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.140> brush

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
better just using the tip of the brush

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.179 
better just using the tip of the brush
to<00:01:50.439> make<00:01:50.859> another<00:01:51.219> little<00:01:51.899> petal<00:01:52.899> of<00:01:53.409> God<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.979> a

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
to these leaves just a little here this

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.780 
to these leaves just a little here this
is<00:03:38.530> such<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.799> quick<00:03:39.190> demonstration<00:03:39.989> but<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.790> lot

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
is such a quick demonstration but a lot

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.910 
is such a quick demonstration but a lot
of<00:03:42.819> times<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.299> find<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:43.900> if<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.590> really

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
of times I find that if if you really

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.160 
of times I find that if if you really
slow<00:03:45.639> down<00:03:45.940> when<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.450> paint<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.019> you're

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
slow down when you paint and you're

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.920 
slow down when you paint and you're
really<00:03:47.680> careful<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.430> don't<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.480> get<00:03:49.689> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
really careful you don't really get the
