00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.010
 right now we are living in 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.690
 last decade a change 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.879
 so rapid that we are perceiving it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 all twenty years has changed with 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.230
 the advent of the so-called technology 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.480
 black hole of no return on its own 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 of the technology that made us do a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.660
 leap forward but of which not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660
 we can more obviously do without it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.430
 there are two great worlds the world that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.590
 on the net and the world that is not on the net 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.390
 today the world that the world in the network between 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 the other largest in the world that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 represents is represented seeks from 5 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.880
 billions of people 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.789
 this has resulted in a tremendous amount 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.649
 change obviously also procuring 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.280
 a bit of stress because it's change 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.079
 means or I begin to exploit these 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.819
 technologies or undergoes them 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.899
 that's when I say anxiety today 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.970
 it means I 'm not using the method 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.679
 correct because if I started using the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.090
 I wouldn't notice technology anymore 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.909
 speed because I sit next to it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.520
 to the driver who in this case is precisely 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.200
 the technological advent that made everything 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.970
 faster but if I sit next to it 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.159
 with the right technology I don't perceive 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.679
 this speed and indeed even 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.229
 I can save and optimize the 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.280
 time has never to have and never to live 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.280
 continually anxious 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.990
 we believe we know the world in which 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.150
 we live when in reality it is not 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.460
 we know it gave me so much in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.370
 very little time and we expected to 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.490
 to hear about economics instead of the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.590
 culture toe a clear vision 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.350
 over the expected ladies have been 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.860
 wonderful because I saw what the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.350
 future 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.420
 It opens horizons maybe not 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.010
 imagine some information because it is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.930
 a bank has decided to do all this 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.060
 for its customers and its prof 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.070
 well because we believe that a bank 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.920
 must not say the obvious and trivial things that 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.560
 now everyone can know the money there 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.610
 serve the future only in one time and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.780
 then a bank should do it 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.550
 reflect as we must 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.070
 plan our future 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.020
 but what we will need this money or not 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.910
 there must escape that money in the future 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.070
 we will need them to do things that still 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.510
 they don't exist that will help us 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.430
 improve the quality of life there 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.980
 they will improve their lives 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.740
 itself to give us all the health sectors 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.170
 that will touch the life of man 360 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.330
 degrees but inevitably 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.610
 will provide costs and investments in 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.860
 sectors in areas that are totally non-existent 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.300
 today if a bank talks to me about the past 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.800
 ca n't get me to plan properly 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.110
 my money to be 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.910
 used in the future here is this is the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.500
 why bank together with 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.480
 improve a corporate university that 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.460
 our corporate university decided 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.140
 to communicate with its customers with 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.300
 a different new message 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.110
 we consider it innovative but above all 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.000
 helpful 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.910
 I would say only without words because it is 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.570
 It was an extremely exciting event 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.570
 rich in content 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:09.810
 the world on the other is much much more 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.810
 serious than the one already built
