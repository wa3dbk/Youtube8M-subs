something<00:00:17.960> about<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.289> conditions<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.280> you

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
something about the conditions so you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.980 
something about the conditions so you
would<00:00:19.580> expect<00:00:19.940> them<00:00:20.120> ted<00:00:20.360> Ligety<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:20.780> come

would expect them ted Ligety to come

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.230 
would expect them ted Ligety to come
down<00:00:21.230> 16th<00:00:21.980> because<00:00:22.310> one<00:00:22.490> skier<00:00:22.760> is<00:00:22.880> skied<00:00:23.090> out

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
down 16th because one skier is skied out

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.720 
down 16th because one skier is skied out
yeah<00:00:23.750> but<00:00:23.990> let's<00:00:24.530> flashback<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:25.160> flock<00:00:25.460> how<00:00:25.670> he

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
yeah but let's flashback to flock how he

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.060 
yeah but let's flashback to flock how he
skied<00:00:26.060> a<00:00:26.120> very<00:00:26.300> round<00:00:26.630> line<00:00:26.990> did<00:00:27.320> not<00:00:27.470> do<00:00:27.830> very

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
skied a very round line did not do very

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.920 
skied a very round line did not do very
well<00:00:28.130> very<00:00:28.520> disappointed<00:00:29.300> he<00:00:29.420> tweaked<00:00:29.690> some

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
well very disappointed he tweaked some

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.109 
well very disappointed he tweaked some
things<00:00:30.170> but<00:00:30.740> his<00:00:30.860> rounder<00:00:31.340> style<00:00:31.640> he<00:00:31.820> likes<00:00:32.000> to

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
things but his rounder style he likes to

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.910 
things but his rounder style he likes to
get<00:00:32.239> those<00:00:32.419> angles<00:00:32.750> actually<00:00:33.020> helped<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.739> this

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
get those angles actually helped in this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.189 
get those angles actually helped in this
first<00:00:34.250> run<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.879> ruts<00:00:35.149> are<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:35.629> big<00:00:35.929> they

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
first run the ruts are so big they

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.869 
first run the ruts are so big they
dictate<00:00:36.649> where<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:36.949> go<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.579> a<00:00:37.670> nice

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
dictate where to go and it's a nice

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.000 
dictate where to go and it's a nice
round<00:00:38.179> line<00:00:38.449> that<00:00:38.749> Ligety<00:00:39.140> actually<00:00:39.589> runs<00:00:39.829> I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
round line that Ligety actually runs I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.130 
round line that Ligety actually runs I
think<00:00:40.219> his<00:00:40.339> rounder<00:00:40.820> slower<00:00:41.390> line<00:00:41.719> was

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
think his rounder slower line was

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.529 
think his rounder slower line was
actually<00:00:42.289> fast<00:00:42.800> in<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:43.219> first<00:00:43.460> run<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.420> I

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
actually fast in this first run and I

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.970 
actually fast in this first run and I
know<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.870> say<00:00:45.079> tweak<00:00:45.350> some<00:00:45.559> things<00:00:45.800> it's

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
know when you say tweak some things it's

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.079 
know when you say tweak some things it's
not<00:00:46.070> an<00:00:46.219> injury<00:00:46.460> when<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.730> talk<00:00:46.850> about<00:00:46.940> he

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
not an injury when we talk about he

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.189 
not an injury when we talk about he
tweaked<00:00:47.359> his<00:00:47.390> equipment

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
tweaked his equipment

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.439 
tweaked his equipment
he<00:00:48.499> was<00:00:48.649> monumentally<00:00:49.489> frustrated<00:00:50.179> with<00:00:50.269> his

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
he was monumentally frustrated with his

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.660 
he was monumentally frustrated with his
result<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.960> flaca<00:00:51.260> because<00:00:51.739> he<00:00:52.159> thought<00:00:52.489> he

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
result in flaca because he thought he

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.880 
result in flaca because he thought he
was<00:00:52.819> fast<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.390> he<00:00:53.539> was<00:00:53.690> abysmally<00:00:54.289> slow<00:00:54.589> and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
was fast and he was abysmally slow and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.979 
was fast and he was abysmally slow and
after<00:00:55.429> watching<00:00:55.609> him<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.089> the<00:00:56.210> early<00:00:56.749> part<00:00:56.960> of

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
after watching him in the early part of

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.399 
after watching him in the early part of
that<00:00:57.109> run<00:00:57.350> those<00:00:57.949> tweaks<00:00:58.339> made<00:00:58.729> a<00:00:58.760> difference

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
that run those tweaks made a difference

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.869 
that run those tweaks made a difference
definitely<00:01:00.409> he<00:01:00.530> just<00:01:00.739> matched<00:01:00.979> up<00:01:01.249> well<00:01:01.519> he

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
definitely he just matched up well he

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.729 
definitely he just matched up well he
fought<00:01:02.210> through<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:02.569> he<00:01:02.809> was<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.050> first<00:01:03.440> and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
fought through it he was the first and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.680 
fought through it he was the first and
you<00:01:04.250> know<00:01:04.339> one<00:01:04.550> of<00:01:04.670> two<00:01:04.909> people<00:01:05.120> ever<00:01:05.479> actually

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
you know one of two people ever actually

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.260 
you know one of two people ever actually
to<00:01:05.960> move<00:01:06.200> up<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.620> this<00:01:06.770> first<00:01:07.070> run<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.729> ted

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
to move up in this first run so ted

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.929 
to move up in this first run so ted
Ligety<00:01:08.680> disrupting<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.890> order<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.549> things

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
Ligety disrupting the order of things

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.530 
Ligety disrupting the order of things
and<00:01:11.210> moving<00:01:11.990> up<00:01:12.140> 11<00:01:12.950> spots<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.700> seemed<00:01:14.000> all<00:01:14.270> but

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
and moving up 11 spots it seemed all but

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.530 
and moving up 11 spots it seemed all but
impossible<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:16.159> do<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.490> until<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.000> american

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
impossible to do that until the american

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.719 
impossible to do that until the american
Ligety<00:01:17.930> came<00:01:18.170> down<00:01:20.649> though<00:01:21.649> sixth<00:01:22.039> place<00:01:22.280> he

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
Ligety came down though sixth place he

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.420 
Ligety came down though sixth place he
is<00:01:22.850> well<00:01:23.210> off<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.810> lead<00:01:23.990> one<00:01:24.259> point<00:01:24.619> six<00:01:25.100> eight

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
is well off the lead one point six eight

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.420 
is well off the lead one point six eight
off<00:01:25.789> but<00:01:26.119> Ligety<00:01:26.570> was<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.590> effective<00:01:28.219> on<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
off but Ligety was so effective on the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.700 
off but Ligety was so effective on the
steep<00:01:28.850> parts<00:01:29.299> when<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.750> was<00:01:29.869> ruddy<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:30.320> mean<00:01:30.560> his

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
steep parts when it was ruddy I mean his

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.289 
steep parts when it was ruddy I mean his
his<00:01:31.009> technique<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.579> little<00:01:31.670> bit<00:01:31.880> round<00:01:32.119> or

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
his technique a little bit round or

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.060 
his technique a little bit round or
really<00:01:32.570> worked<00:01:32.810> with<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.079> ruts<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.500> ruts<00:01:33.710> at

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
really worked with the ruts the ruts at

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.069 
really worked with the ruts the ruts at
this<00:01:34.399> point<00:01:34.700> probably<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.329> same<00:01:35.659> as<00:01:35.869> what<00:01:35.990> he

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
this point probably the same as what he

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.569 
this point probably the same as what he
experienced<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.770> first<00:01:37.009> run<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:37.430> he

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
experienced in that first run so he

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.480 
experienced in that first run so he
should<00:01:37.820> be<00:01:37.909> used<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.770> see<00:01:39.770> what<00:01:39.920> he<00:01:40.070> can<00:01:40.280> do

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
should be used to it see what he can do

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.120 
should be used to it see what he can do
with<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.880> deteriorating<00:01:41.750> conditions<00:01:42.200> 1.25

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
with the deteriorating conditions 1.25

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.340 
with the deteriorating conditions 1.25
at<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.880> start<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.420> amazes<00:01:44.840> me<00:01:44.869> he's<00:01:45.109> always

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
at the start it amazes me he's always

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.959 
at the start it amazes me he's always
seems<00:01:45.560> like<00:01:45.619> he's<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.039> backseat<00:01:46.520> riding

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969
