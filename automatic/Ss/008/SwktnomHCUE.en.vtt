 [Music] 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.770
 hi friends from youtube I am to be 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.150
 tourist thank you very much for visiting my 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.419
 channel 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.419
 [Music] 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 as I said in my first video today 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 let's cook a solomo de cuerito 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.890
 roasted from a pretty Saturday cut it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.890
 it's very good on the grill 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.000
 first we have a single mode of cuerito 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.890
 approximately three kilos we are going to 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.239
 cut it let's cook only the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.879
 half as I told you this is a cut 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.440
 of meat that is pretty funny but 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.549
 It is very good for the grill 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.549
 [Music] 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 normally I do not soil it must be both the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.149
 meat when it's taken to the grill 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.519
 however, I want to try something can 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.840
 use pepper sauce 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.540
 black rosemary laurel and garlic let's liquefy 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.440
 everything with oil can be added 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.440
 lemon too 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.090
 [Music] 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.190
 in a food processor we mix 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.290
 all the ingredients that I just had 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.880
 say two ways in the in the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 video description you can find 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.369
 more information the idea is that all 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.660
 ingredients in oil can add 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.729
 a little more oil then this mixture 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.280
 they pour it on the meat and spread it 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.649
 moody's I use a technique that does not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.259
 they really like that it's a product 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.039
 knife in the meat and stuff them with 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039
 the mixture 15 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:02:11.980
 [Music] 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 we place the meat on the embers and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.270
 we wait for them to cook 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.190
 approximately 15 minutes per side 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.130
 at the moment of carrying out this war in the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.410
 grill are going to notice that I'm going 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.120
 to burn the fat because it 's normal that 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.730
 is what I want I think this fat 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.410
 I do not like to eat it, I prefer 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.330
 that the meat is cooked well and that the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.830
 fat burns to equal fat and or 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.110
 I will discard 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.750
 [Music] 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.370
 then turn to the side where you have 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:46.260
 Cooked still in 5 minutes 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:48.840
 [Music] 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.280
 after this time we removed the meat 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.950
 of the fire and let it cool down a 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.379
 moment 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.269
 because we let it cool because 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.280
 if we remove the flesh from the fire 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.700
 and we cut it hot of all the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.170
 juices of these are going to bounce pons for 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.010
 help the meat retain more 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.709
 liquid and then the cut I like 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.870
 cook the whole meat and then cut it 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.209
 I like to cut it once 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 I'm used to that and it's always been 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.760
 come out better can you notice how the meat 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:30.620
 still not cooked to some 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:32.959
 people like it as well as they have noticed 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.120
 the meat inside does not have enough 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.269
 flavor we see official seasoning no 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.280
 matter we are going to place the barbecue 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.069
 let's add sea salt though 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.900
 it seems that we use a lot of salt 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.410
 thick and not as salty as the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.410
 antilles 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.569
 we let cook approximately 3 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.709
 minutes then we flipped it the left 3 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.239
 more minutes 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.750
 remember to add a little more 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.750
 developing 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.370
 you can do a little more from the beginning and 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.390
 paint the flesh when you're on the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.390
 cluj on the embers 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.939
