00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.980
 yes hello people and welcome 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.900
 to a new video here on max today 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.490
 It should be a product of the company totally 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.810
 day go to a case for that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.689
 iphone 6 resp 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.419
 for the iphone 6 plus at 16 i have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.990
 Of course, here lie and the whole will 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.870
 delivered here in his fancy box 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 with the company logo here again 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.150
 when we open the box we find 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.620
 Here's the case before here 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.270
 the left side which is right here 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 nicely finished like this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.990
 then we have a little here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.520
 How to attach the case to the 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.250
 bring and remove iphone 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.750
 without damaging it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.440
 yes then there are also two small ones 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.870
 Just use it again 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.780
 there are the iphone for it 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.850
 can smoothly click into the case 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.660
 there are now two variants of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.550
 once here this closed case and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.720
 The I stayed here with it now 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:21.030
 The cut apple looks like that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.040
 So really very stylish 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.280
 you definitely have to say that is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.540
 the case here really made in germany 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 It is manufactured here in Germany 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.659
 and was super precise with a cnc 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.970
 cutter is cut out everything is real 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.170
 one hundred percent fit that is here 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.409
 high-tech fibers here the whole 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.409
 to summarize a carbon case 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.960
 is for the iPhone 6, we say look 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.950
 Let's have a quick look here in one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.409
 small all around the case and also 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.549
 the accuracy of fit above can be seen 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.860
 In any case, how perfect the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.979
 Camera lens the microphone and led 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.479
 lightning cut out of here are the ones 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.629
 apple-logo simply free there's just as 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.370
 once said with a car on the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.290
 left side is super here 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.280
 perfectly cut out here are the two 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.230
 volume buttons 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.840
 and also the newsweek on the other 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.240
 You just look wonderful the one side 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.000
 switch out of the himself also 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.560
 can press super so there is nothing 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.050
 negatively affects that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.180
 bad press or here 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.090
 the newsweek is also still 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.489
 easy to operate 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.600
 here on the bottom you can see times 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.850
 how precise she simply worked 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.860
 has been 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.410
 It's perfect lightning 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.720
 connection is free you can so completely 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.730
 normal listening to music via headphones 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.220
 Connection is easy but purely yes 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.690
 just here with the golden iphone 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.420
 is it really good? 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.910
 valid white front and then here this 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.660
 transition of the carbon look 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.880
 this extraordinary 3d optics makes it 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.709
 You just have to look at it here 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.480
 already say I have lately 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.819
 I have the pace about two weeks 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.980
 now here in connection with the 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.950
 iphone 6 in use are really very 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.880
 many people said that iphone 6 in itself 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.790
 is pretty cool 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.530
 in conjunction with the carbon case will be 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.140
 it just twice as much higher quality 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.130
 or so much nobler that there are really many 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.900
 people have said 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.549
 where did you I'd want that too 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.440
 but even if you're the one in the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.470
 use everyday actually hardly notice 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.110
 that there is something here so that 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.980
 case is very thin in itself 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.989
 0 4 mm what just terrific one has yes 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.200
 barely increasing in width at height 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:52.220
 weighs millimeter thick in the thick four 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.410
 So just eleven grams likely 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.950
 instructions as hard as here 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.440
 whole case and it's not like that either 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.630
 the case is just thin and 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.700
 fast breaks or just bad 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.959
 processed materials one is saved 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.420
 no, on the contrary 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.579
 carbon is a very robust material 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.459
 and also extremely easy through these 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.620
 Fibers yes, which I also very often 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.169
 the iPhone 6 is noticed by the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.329
 new round and also very smooth 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.440
 surface is the iphone also always 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.600
 Slipping a bit more slippery 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.120
 maybe often out of the hands 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.530
 through these whole fibers became the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.169
 haptic just a few times 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.389
 improves the grip 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.029
 has been increased that is just a lot 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.900
 A hands is better off less 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.759
 slipping hands 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.840
 so of course I want you too 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.699
 very briefly show how your iphone in 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.009
 the case gets without anything 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.529
 breaks down or you are afraid you have 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.180
 would break something relative 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:54.199
 just you just need as I said 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.639
 The installation help here with the 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.620
 scope of delivery is included 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.360
 so very important is that the iphone with 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.569
 the left side comes in here first 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.650
 then you take this montage help here 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.499
 her grabs here exactly between the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.810
 off switch so about 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.979
 and then you could do it 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.919
 click here for a fix 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.110
 clack clack clack so all four 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.360
 corners are in here then look stops 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.229
 here is this montage ahead and you 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.789
 can easily pull out here 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.460
 yes that was the way it looks 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:32.240
 now stop without the cut out 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.960
 apple behind also very very cool and around 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.659
 to take out the iphone are here 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.800
 hold these notches so that you can 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:44.210
 case bend a bit backwards 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.009
 That means you can just do it like that 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.330
 the whole thing must press backwards 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.409
 until it looks like that and then you can 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.919
 Almost here, too, because I have one 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.080
 Fingernail here between go and that 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.839
 take out everything 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.189
 zack that's it then so relatively simple 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:04.310
 then we are already at the end of the 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:09.009
 First of all, videos would like to arrive 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.009
 me here at the company touratech 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.419
 Thank you for the provision here 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.270
 send these two super super and 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.729
 I also thank miserable cases 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.219
 of course with the dear sascha me 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.770
 the tip with the carbon cases given 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:27.110
 has also looked at the 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.749
 Colleagues app store and touchpen over 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.389
 the two youtube colleagues have as well 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:34.099
 Another cool video about the carbon 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.620
 I would definitely do cases 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.370
 recommend you stop by 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.440
 Do not forget to subscribe 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.000
 and if you liked the video 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.700
 Of course, I would be very, very much too 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.620

 please write up please 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.830
 in the comments you like the whole 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.780
 Here you can enjoy the real carbon 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.490
 made in germany i am really 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.880
 simply excited about it 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.620
 she had many looks and yes that 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.090
 should it have been then until 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.090
 there people are doing well and
