take out the packaging and we have

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
take out the packaging and we have
another<00:02:02.490> box<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> bottom<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.479> box<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
another box in the bottom of the box and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.059 
another box in the bottom of the box and
that's<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.380 

there<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.159> is<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.849> our<00:02:15.030> power<00:02:15.120> cable

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
there it is that's our power cable

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.610 
there it is that's our power cable
that's<00:02:15.689> what<00:02:15.810> we're<00:02:15.900> gonna<00:02:16.019> use<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.260> plug<00:02:16.500> it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that's what we're gonna use to plug it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.789 
that's what we're gonna use to plug it
into<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.860> wall<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:17.790> looks<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.420> takes

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
into the wall and it looks like it takes

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.229 
into the wall and it looks like it takes
five<00:02:19.799> volts<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.340> gonna<00:02:20.519> use<00:02:20.640> about<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:21.000> amp

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
five volts it's gonna use about one amp

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.000 
five volts it's gonna use about one amp
of<00:02:21.420> energy<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:22.019> about<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.349> much<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.530> an

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
of energy so that's about as much as an

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.800 
of energy so that's about as much as an
iPhone<00:02:23.159> cell<00:02:23.610> phone<00:02:23.790> charger<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.599> open

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
iPhone cell phone charger then we open

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630 
iPhone cell phone charger then we open
up<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.019> other<00:02:25.140> side<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.739> there<00:02:26.220> are<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
up the other side and there are the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.420 
up the other side and there are the
batteries<00:02:27.120> two<00:02:27.329> triple<00:02:27.840> a's<00:02:27.989> for<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> remote<00:02:28.590> as

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
batteries two triple a's for a remote as

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.550 
batteries two triple a's for a remote as
well<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.760> our<00:02:29.849> AV<00:02:30.090> cable<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.110> problem<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
well as our AV cable now the problem the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800 
well as our AV cable now the problem the
AV<00:02:31.829> cable<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.400> you're<00:02:32.940> only<00:02:33.480> going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.750> be

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
AV cable is you're only going to be

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.149 
AV cable is you're only going to be
getting<00:02:34.019> standard<00:02:34.440> definition<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.069> not

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
getting standard definition you're not

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.500 
getting standard definition you're not
gonna<00:02:35.250> be<00:02:35.400> getting<00:02:35.489> high-definition<00:02:36.269> which

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
gonna be getting high-definition which

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
gonna be getting high-definition which
if<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.989> bought<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.560> probably<00:02:37.799> want<00:02:37.950> the
