00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.840
 hello friends with you and fox 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.630
 today's video will be dedicated 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.310
 the development of players like foot soldier since 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.200
 dating series battlefield with me 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.850
 happened to the fourth part then me 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.080
 had to spend a lot of extra time 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.420
 before you go out to a certain 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.790
 game level and in this video I wanted 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.770
 to share with you how this is possible 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.020
 save time and maximize 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.000
 your progression in the game for the pilot of 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.900
 my opinion in general, the players are divided into 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.660
 two groups 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.640
 The first are those that are the main fan in the game. 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.040
 and they donâ€™t bother too much 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.020
 games are still the main waste in which everything 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.270
 means good hello bipod to 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.190
 sight in a compartment with a smoke cream cream and 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.050
 other so-called documents not 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.790
 we forget that it is about the mode to 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.920
 Venice 2 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.479
 these are the ones who like sports 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.110
 Gray component of its competitive 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.899
 spirit 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.330
 they are constantly learning and looking for ways 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.670
 increase your skin and usually 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.590
 Prefer this format this group 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.290
 few and can be counted 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.600
 The most skillful players in this fendi 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.390
 usually players more or less 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.690
 starting to lean into one group or another 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.340
 after pumped most 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.200
 weapons and replayed in all mode then 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.260
 is you decide who is not 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.479
 tank crew pilot or kakhetins let's say 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.869
 you have already passed this way and clearly for yourself 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.610
 decide that you are closer in spirit infantry 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.880
 part of the game and you want to see 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.500
 further grandfathers goal 20 in this area 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.180
 you must understand that the vast 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.250
 most tournament clans 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.710
 conducted by the rules with and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.229
 which means you 'll have to forget about everything 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 four m320 their sam claymore mortars 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.299
 hardcore mode about some countries 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.860
 going all is not limited to the whole set of rules 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.420
 you can see by clicking on the link 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.400
 under the video and so having read the list 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.909
 allowed weapons and choosing a table 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.399
 to the soul 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.500
 we select the infantry server and return 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.510
 in public get used to your choice 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.950
 gun away from you I can recommend 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.280
 try out aed from 23rd 416 or from numbers and 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 not wiki snipers engineers before 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.620
 how to start getting used to possibly new 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.390
 for you the style of play and the weapons you need 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.080
 produce and pregame 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.810
 settings first 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.730
 the graphics and im his cooler on low this 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.800
 done not to breccia life 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.520
 your computer how to 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.740
 unload 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840
 the very picture of the game at low settings 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.930
 there will be less special effects and subject 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.460
 distracting and zamyl your step back 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.080
 the only thing that can be put on 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.640
 Ultra is the quality of the grid 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.170
 responsible for the drawing distance 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.990
 objects sound put military film so 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.020
 as the steps and cries of your opponent will 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.700
 the best are audible 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.520
 mouse setting here is the main requirement 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.980
 this is uncheck enable enhanced 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.740
 the accuracy of the pointer is possible 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.290
 make the control panel mouse settings 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.380
 thus we remove the relationship between 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.990
 The distance and the speed of the hook into the reeds that 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.360
 regards sensitivity that and and each 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.820
 selects for themselves but what it is lower than 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.380
 better your accuracy will be 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.520
 my settings are 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.840
 sensitivity in game 13 at now 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.670
 450 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.239
 further we go to the main parameters 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.310
 skin 1 game is the ability to play 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.860
 the team understands that we need to start 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.930
 find this very command but more on that 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.430
 further 2 practical analysis 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.400
 ability to analyze correctly 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.140
 information reaching you game sounds 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.670
 map of the location of the enemy and 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.860
 friendly skill unit competently 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.690
 move around the map for training 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.970
 This parameter each time you 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.800
 merge constantly ask yourself a question 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.030
 what did i do wrong and what should i 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.880
 make sure that this is no longer 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.950
 repeated it is also necessary to know everything 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.459
 advantageous position on the map to competently 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.290
 when you move along it is third aiming here 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.390
 main practice practice and again 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.459
 practice can also recommend 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.430
 olympus shooting range 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.280
 or similar to it further subject to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.320
 All advice much will depend on 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.390
 Your rivals around the try 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.310
 find stronger opponents and enter 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.020
 play against them remember you 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.390
 develop only when you play 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.460
 against a strong opponent if 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.419
 the usual public class is too easy 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.729
 then yourself 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.280
 I recommend a couple of servers which we 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.300
 you can often meet strong infantry 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.590
 players this 7 6 he same tank 2 or next 2 in 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.930
 by which the evil deed 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.940
 I warn you that going to these 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.410
 series you have to be ready what's your 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.840
 when it may fall 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.570
 two times but the level of the game as a whole and 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.040
 will definitely increase if you yourself 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.890
 feel confident on both of these 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.200
 servers then start playing clanwars on 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.900
 who come best platoon players 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.300
 if you do not have your team 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.520
 then you can also try your hand at 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.070
 Versus where play the strongest attack on 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.380
 battlefield but without experience c'mon vars 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.670
 I do not recommend going there to 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.730
 to sum up the fate of the players will 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.980
 caught your team but if you 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.750
 you will be able to grow to the level at which you 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.060
 You can calmly play on Versus 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.500
 and win then boldly apply 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.450
 to participate in tournaments 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.790
 because if you get to the top 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.100
 and get a cash prize means you become 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.080
 progamer after all the professionals then thats 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.510
 for his work is able to receive 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.520
 profit and everyone else is just 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.220
 players someone husband and someone worse 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.800
 well today we briefly went way 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.780
 development from beginner to pros in the game 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.370
 battlefield hope you were interested with 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.370
 you were nightfox until new meetings
