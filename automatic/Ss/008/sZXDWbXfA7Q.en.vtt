00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.516
Again! You beat me again!

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.040
How did you get so good?

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.720
What? OH!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.980
Good evening and welcome to KNS

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.060
with me, Dick Loong

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.300
Tonight, HDB's new goals to set up

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.720
centralised recycling chutes.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.693
We go around Singapore to find out

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:34.340
just how much Singaporeans know about recycling

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.340
We go over live to Monica Cheng

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.260
How did you win?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.560
How did you... How did you always know?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.980
I'm now here with Abdul Abuden

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.880
an entrepreneur who believes in the power of recycling

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.060
So, I hear you like to recycle, Mr Abdul?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.600
Abuden!

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.480
Eh, you know I found out

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.240
That our landfills will be filled up by 2035

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.220
The horror!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.960
Can you imagine our Merlion

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.220
Swimming around with foreign ta - I mean trash

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.880
So I am a visionary

00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:09.274
Come, take a look at my vision

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.200
So I decided to start this business

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.900
brilliant money-making business called,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.540
You Don't Want, I Take La!

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.680
So you give me things that you don't want

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740
I take! And I give you things that you do want

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.080
You take!

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.880
Very simple

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.760
You don't want, I take la!

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.135
So people will give me things that they don't want

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:31.055
old bottles, old tin cans, old clothes

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.200
Sun Ho albums

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:35.435
sometimes they even give me old boyfriends

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.640
I said you don't want, I take la!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.210
I give you new boyfriends!

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:40.895
They're all in the closet

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.830
Do you know that cooking oil

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.875
fresh fruit peels and coffee grounds

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520
can be made into fertilizers and fuels?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140
Would you like a cup of coffee?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.300
Yeah, sure!

00:01:58.515 --> 00:01:59.955
Still have somemore!

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.720
Free!

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.876
Do Singaporeans actually recycle?

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:05.716
Or, do they recycle enough?

00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:08.774
I don't recycle, but my parents do recycle

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.675
I don't think Singaporeans recycle enough

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.600
I think that recycling is a good habit

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.920
Why?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.520
It can save the Planet Earth

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.078
Well, I only can speak from my experience 

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:21.338
and I don't really find it appealing 

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:24.180
because you have to sort things out, and find a proper recycling bin

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.794
It's like, it's like the moon landings

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.734
it's like, it's like aliens!

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:30.275
it's like Sun Ho's album sales

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.660
It's just, a huge conspiracy!

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.800
And that's why, that's why

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.360
I educate everyone that I meet

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.640
Thank you Monica

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.720
and that's why we should all Reduce, Reuse and Recycle

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.600
Which is why I've been reusing the same parking coupon for the past 3 years

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.540
This has been Dick Loong for KNS

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.320
See you all next time, on the programme!

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.140
PA! Ticket to Perth! Now!
