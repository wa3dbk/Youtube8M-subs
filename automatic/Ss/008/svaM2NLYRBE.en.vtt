world's first nuclear metal a 30 gun
streak<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.220> gun<00:00:23.880> game<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.769> you're

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
streak on gun game and to do this you're

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.540 
streak on gun game and to do this you're
gonna<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> 30<00:00:27.630> kills<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
gonna have to get this is a 30 kills a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.849 
gonna have to get this is a 30 kills a
30<00:00:29.550> kill<00:00:29.880> streak<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:31.019> gun<00:00:31.320> game<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
30 kill streak and in gun game the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.049 
30 kill streak and in gun game the
reason<00:00:32.099> why<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.430> difficult<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.030> because

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
reason why it's so difficult is because

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
reason why it's so difficult is because
there's<00:00:33.450> only<00:00:33.510> 20<00:00:34.079> weapons<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.829> cycle

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
there's only 20 weapons you can cycle

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
there's only 20 weapons you can cycle
through<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.930> means<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.469> only

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
through and so that means there's only

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.610 
through and so that means there's only
10<00:00:38.219> kills<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.629> 10<00:00:39.870> kills<00:00:40.079> left<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> go

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
10 kills you have 10 kills left to go

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
10 kills you have 10 kills left to go
for<00:00:40.890> 30<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.329> those<00:00:42.420> 10<00:00:42.629> kills<00:00:42.870> you

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
for 30 and to get those 10 kills you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
for 30 and to get those 10 kills you
have<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.469> knife<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.090> makes

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
have to use your knife and so it makes

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.880 
have to use your knife and so it makes
it<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.660> difficult<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> 10<00:00:46.649> kill<00:00:46.860> streak

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it very difficult for the 10 kill streak

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.549 
it very difficult for the 10 kill streak
with<00:00:47.309> only<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:47.940> knife<00:00:48.120> while<00:00:49.050> people<00:00:49.260> use

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
with only your knife while people use

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
with only your knife while people use
while<00:00:50.070> people<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.610> sorts<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.969> guns<00:00:51.210> like

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
while people have all sorts of guns like

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
while people have all sorts of guns like
they<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.690> launchers<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.829> snipers

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
they have launchers they have snipers

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
they have launchers they have snipers
they<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.610> shotguns<00:00:53.940> submachine<00:00:54.870> gun<00:00:55.440> so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
they have shotguns submachine gun so

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
they have shotguns submachine gun so
it's<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.520> difficult<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it's really really difficult and I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
it's really really difficult and I
managed<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.440> took<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> while<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> do

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
managed to do it took me a while to do

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
managed to do it took me a while to do
it<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.359> I've<00:01:00.539> got<00:01:01.050> 300<00:01:01.620> wins<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> gun<00:01:02.160> game

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
kill was made up for the kills I got off

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.999 
kill was made up for the kills I got off
the<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> afk<00:01:24.000> guy<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.780> he<00:01:25.110> wasn't<00:01:25.439> my<00:01:25.500> friend<00:01:25.710> he

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the a afk guy but he wasn't my friend he

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
the a afk guy but he wasn't my friend he
wasn't<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> lobby<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.600> me<00:01:27.750> he<00:01:28.320> was

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
wasn't in the lobby with me he was

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
wasn't in the lobby with me he was
obviously<00:01:28.650> boosting<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.520> split<00:01:29.850> screen

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
obviously boosting with a split screen

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
obviously boosting with a split screen
err<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.140> don't<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.439> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
err and if you don't know what that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.550 
err and if you don't know what that
means<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.890> basically<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.490> guy<00:01:33.020> who<00:01:34.020> turns<00:01:34.470> on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
means it's basically a guy who turns on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
means it's basically a guy who turns on
his<00:01:34.710> second<00:01:35.040> controller<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.820> he<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.299> keeps

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
his second controller and he just keeps

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560 
his second controller and he just keeps
running<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> guy<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.090> get<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.180> getting

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
running to the guy and get it getting

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.020 
running to the guy and get it getting
free<00:01:39.750> kills<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.140> him<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.619> obviously<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
free kills of him so obviously that that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.580 
free kills of him so obviously that that
guy<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.270> trying<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.290> still

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
guy was trying to do it and I still

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
guy was trying to do it and I still
managed<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.100> nuclear<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.820> gameplay

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
managed to get nuclear in this gameplay

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.260 
managed to get nuclear in this gameplay
despite<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> guy<00:01:46.409> trying<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> boost<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.369> good

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
despite that guy trying to boost so good

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.759 
at me with would have had a comeback but
obviously<00:03:24.150> he<00:03:24.300> didn't<00:03:24.659> he<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:24.989> boosting<00:03:25.470> and

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
obviously he didn't he is boosting and

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.399 
obviously he didn't he is boosting and
so<00:03:26.099> if<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.150> see<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.420> gameplay<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.290> in

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409
