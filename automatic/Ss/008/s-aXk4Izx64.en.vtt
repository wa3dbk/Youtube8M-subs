00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
here that holds 32 ounces and the tank
is<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> little<00:02:05.729> bit<00:02:06.240> difficult<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.320> out

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
is a little bit difficult to get out

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
is a little bit difficult to get out
because<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:11.009> doesn't<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.489> hoses

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
because it's a it doesn't have hoses

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.200 
because it's a it doesn't have hoses
this<00:02:12.270> actually<00:02:12.690> push

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
this actually push

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.620 
this actually push
into<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.750> other<00:02:14.380> portion<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.630> male

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
into the other portion you know the male

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.540 
into the other portion you know the male
portion<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.320> other<00:02:17.470> side<00:02:17.680> okay<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.310> so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
portion on the other side okay and so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.070 
portion on the other side okay and so
it's<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.790> good<00:02:18.970> friction<00:02:19.390> fit<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> doesn't

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it's a good friction fit so it doesn't

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.260 
it's a good friction fit so it doesn't
leak<00:02:20.200> got<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.490> does<00:02:21.640> take<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.880> little<00:02:22.150> bit

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
leak got it so it does take a little bit

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.320 
leak got it so it does take a little bit
of<00:02:23.160> attitude<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.580> get<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.090> out<00:02:25.210> it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
of attitude to get it in and out it

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.820 
of attitude to get it in and out it
takes<00:02:25.450> an<00:02:25.660> attitude<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.140> what<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> found

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
takes an attitude and what I found

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.400 
takes an attitude and what I found
instead<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.220> great<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:27.820> it's<00:02:28.570> perfect<00:02:29.080> for<00:02:29.140> me

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
instead of great if it's perfect for me

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.630 
instead of great if it's perfect for me
then<00:02:29.620> right<00:02:29.860> yeah<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.960> get<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.640> instead

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
then right yeah there you get it instead

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.790 
then right yeah there you get it instead
of<00:02:33.700> pulling<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.840> for<00:02:35.080> me<00:02:35.260> what

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
of pulling on that like that for me what

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.290 
of pulling on that like that for me what
I<00:02:35.830> found<00:02:36.190> works<00:02:36.490> better<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.030> have

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
I found works better if you have

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.400 
I found works better if you have
fingernails<00:02:37.600> at<00:02:37.930> all

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
fingernails at all

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.930 
fingernails at all
just<00:02:38.860> get<00:02:39.010> your<00:02:39.130> fingernails<00:02:39.520> under<00:02:39.820> each

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
just get your fingernails under each

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.610 
just get your fingernails under each
side<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.420> give<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> little<00:02:40.720> push<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.440> do

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
side and give a little push and it so do

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.320 
side and give a little push and it so do
not<00:02:41.650> yeah<00:02:42.220> bottom<00:02:42.550> won't<00:02:42.850> go<00:02:42.970> everywhere

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
not yeah bottom won't go everywhere

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.900 
not yeah bottom won't go everywhere

okay that's a lot of fun and hey let's
give<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.670> little<00:03:36.849> squirt<00:03:39.209> yeah<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.079> now<00:03:41.409> you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
give it a little squirt yeah so now you

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.949 
give it a little squirt yeah so now you
got<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.920> cool<00:03:42.099> this<00:03:42.280> down<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.390> speedy<00:03:43.690> way

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
got to cool this down and the speedy way

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.809 
got to cool this down and the speedy way
to<00:03:44.019> do<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:45.569> like<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.829> then<00:03:47.980> hold<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.459> put

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
to do it like that and then hold it put

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.960 
to do it like that and then hold it put
a<00:03:48.849> cup<00:03:49.090> under<00:03:49.390> there<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:50.459> hold<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.579> down<00:03:51.760> for

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
a cup under there and hold this down for

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.140 
a cup under there and hold this down for
three<00:03:52.150> seconds<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:56.280> think<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.940> go

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
three seconds and I think it go

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.660 
three seconds and I think it go
otherwise<00:03:58.629> you'll<00:03:58.840> be<00:03:58.870> steaming<00:03:59.260> no<00:03:59.950> but<00:04:00.519> does

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
otherwise you'll be steaming no but does

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.210 
otherwise you'll be steaming no but does
it's<00:04:00.819> like<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:01.650> pre-programmed<00:04:02.650> amount

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
it's like a pre-programmed amount

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.630 
it's like a pre-programmed amount
pre-programmed<00:04:04.209> amount<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.599> water<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:06.400> boil

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
pre-programmed amount of water to boil

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.080 
pre-programmed amount of water to boil
around<00:04:06.970> assumable<00:04:08.220> okay<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.280> we'll<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.940> back

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
around assumable okay so we'll be back

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.009 
around assumable okay so we'll be back
why<00:04:10.299> don't<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.510> work<00:04:10.690> your<00:04:10.870> milk<00:04:11.049> Gail<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.720> we
