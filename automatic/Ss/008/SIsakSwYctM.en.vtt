gear<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.010> now<00:01:05.129> normally<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:06.030> most

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
gear and now normally I don't think most

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
gear and now normally I don't think most
people<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.600> spend<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> time<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
people would spend a lot of time on it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.030

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it for parts that actually make sense to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
it for parts that actually make sense to

nice bit of detail you can see there
it's<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> little<00:02:15.190> VIN<00:02:15.489> number<00:02:15.850> plate<00:02:16.120> that

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
it's like a little VIN number plate that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.150 
it's like a little VIN number plate that
shows<00:02:16.570> your<00:02:16.720> ship<00:02:16.930> serial<00:02:17.440> number<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:17.890> stuff

I<00:02:18.370> thought<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.760> was<00:02:18.880> pretty<00:02:19.060> cool<00:02:19.420> now<00:02:19.870> it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
I thought that was pretty cool now it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.140 
I thought that was pretty cool now it's
not<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:20.890> typed<00:02:21.070> out<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:21.430> there<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:21.820> it's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
not actually typed out on there but it's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.120 
not actually typed out on there but it's
still<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.720> idea<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.140> it's<00:02:23.440> there<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.860> quite

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
still the idea that it's there is quite

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.880 
still the idea that it's there is quite
nice<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.019> here<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.320> see<00:02:26.500> there's<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.739> lot
