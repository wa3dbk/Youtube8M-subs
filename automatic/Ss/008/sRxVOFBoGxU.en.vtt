00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
would tell you that does have a little

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.630 
would tell you that does have a little
weight<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> bad<00:00:41.280> thing<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.610> mean

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
weight to it not in the bad thing I mean

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.040 
weight to it not in the bad thing I mean
wasting<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.570> more<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
wasting a little bit more than the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630 
wasting a little bit more than the
iPhone<00:00:43.379> 5<00:00:43.590> does<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.370> sometimes

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
iPhone 5 does but I think sometimes

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
iPhone 5 does but I think sometimes
people<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.239> plastic<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.870> think

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
people think of plastic and they think

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
people think of plastic and they think
that<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.320> may<00:00:46.440> feel<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> little<00:00:46.829> too<00:00:47.160> light<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that it may feel a little too light and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.279 
that it may feel a little too light and
that<00:00:47.820> may<00:00:47.969> make<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> feel<00:00:48.629> cheap<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that may make you feel cheap but I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
that may make you feel cheap but I
always<00:00:49.440> say<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.860> iPhone<00:00:50.430> 5c<00:00:50.789> actually

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059

always say that this iPhone 5c actually
feels<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.329> ceramic<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.320> here's<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
feels like ceramic now here's just a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
feels like ceramic now here's just a
side-by-side<00:00:52.980> comparison<00:00:53.370> between<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.449> new

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629

iPhone 5s and the new iPhone 5c now I'm

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.459 
iPhone 5s and the new iPhone 5c now I'm
not<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> put<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.079> whole<00:00:58.199> bunch<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
not going to put up a whole bunch of

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.750 
not going to put up a whole bunch of
dimensions<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.399> tell<00:00:59.550> by

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
dimensions but you can just tell by

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
dimensions but you can just tell by
doing<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.120> eye<00:01:00.180> test<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> iPhone<00:01:01.590> 5c

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
doing your eye test that the iPhone 5c

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
doing your eye test that the iPhone 5c
is<00:01:02.280> thicker<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> take<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.840> more

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is thicker so it's going to take up more

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
is thicker so it's going to take up more
space<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.470> hand<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.890> again<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.309> does

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
space in your hand but again it does

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
space in your hand but again it does
have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.850> good<00:01:06.030> feel<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.840> taking

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
have a really good feel to it now taking

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.210
