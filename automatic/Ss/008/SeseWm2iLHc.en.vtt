video<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.040> that's<00:00:35.160> pretty<00:00:35.309> good<00:00:35.430> total

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
video I think that's pretty good total

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.290 
video I think that's pretty good total
and<00:00:35.940> let's<00:00:36.450> get<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and let's get right into it so this is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760 
and let's get right into it so this is
obviously<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:39.960> crazy<00:00:40.230> shoe<00:00:40.590> but

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
obviously a really crazy shoe but

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
starting off on the bottom probably the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.869 
starting off on the bottom probably the
simplest<00:00:42.930> part<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> shoe<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.700> have

the heel this is a lot more basic
traction<00:00:56.399> pattern<00:00:56.550> than<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> newer<00:00:57.390> flying

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
at lunar models and I would have to say

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.549 
at lunar models and I would have to say
that<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.420> better<00:01:00.600> moving<00:01:01.289> on

that I do like this one better moving on
to<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> middle<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> upper<00:01:02.640> though<00:01:02.910> obviously

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to the middle and upper though obviously

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.960 
to the middle and upper though obviously
we<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.049> cool<00:01:04.290> sort<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> wavy

flex<00:01:06.360> groove<00:01:06.659> midsole<00:01:07.080> design<00:01:07.439> which<00:01:07.650> looks

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
flex groove midsole design which looks

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.429 
flex groove midsole design which looks
quite<00:01:08.490> nice<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.000> opinion<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
quite nice in my opinion and then the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
quite nice in my opinion and then the
upper<00:01:10.880> doesn't<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.090> need<00:01:12.270> explaining<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
upper doesn't really need explaining it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
upper doesn't really need explaining it
looks<00:01:13.290> amazing<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.549> reminds<00:01:14.820> me<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
looks amazing this really reminds me of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.109 
looks amazing this really reminds me of
like<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.770> TV<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.759> getting<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
like when your TV is not getting a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
like when your TV is not getting a
proper<00:01:18.330> signal<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> guys<00:01:19.409> ever<00:01:19.799> go<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
proper signal if you guys ever go out to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.469 
proper signal if you guys ever go out to
the<00:01:20.310> cabin<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.790> when<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the cabin I know when I'm out at the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.020 
the cabin I know when I'm out at the
cabin<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:22.020> gets<00:01:22.259> terrible<00:01:22.680> TV<00:01:23.250> service<00:01:23.790> over

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
cabin it gets terrible TV service over

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.820 
cabin it gets terrible TV service over
there<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.810> happens<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
there so this happens a lot when the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
there so this happens a lot when the
shoe<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> shoe<00:01:26.970> looks<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.289 
shoe or when the shoe looks like this
when<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> TV<00:01:27.930> looks<00:01:28.290> exactly<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.549> it's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
when the TV looks exactly like this it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
when the TV looks exactly like this it's
a<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.720> light<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> flexible<00:01:31.439> planet<00:01:32.070> upper

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
a very light and flexible planet upper

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859
