00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.350
 environment to be able to possess it is 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.260
 the point that the family has to leave 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.320

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 it will be enough to get rid of 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.680
 michael or with him because he's going to go a lot 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.120
 beyond 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.239
 I assure you that in the book he will give you a 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.620
 despair of wanting to grab this 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.680
 man and kill him and make him pieces of what 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.209
 exasperating and obsessive and possessive 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.209
 what is really 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.939
 It is a story 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.489
 very good keeps you the whole book 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:22.640
 tense the entire textbook because no 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.040
 It will get only with Asia but to 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.579
 put with his family with his father with his 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.760
 mother with everyone there is nothing to this 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:34.420
 man stop him nothing is an obsession 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.310
 what do you have with this woman really that 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.489
 despair despair 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.310
 it's a super recommended book I just read 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.650
 a long time ago about two years ago 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.540
 and should read again because I 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.110
 agreement that I liked a lot 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.410
 very much 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.370
 it's very easy it would be very easy maybe 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.220
 John Kander at certain times 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.130
 the book goes up much later it goes down a little 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.170
 and then go up a little bit more, have those 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.240
 ripples in the story but never 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.270
 decays never details much 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.000
 it starts very catchy very catching 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.820
 maybe in the middle it's a bit more linear 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.580
 but after very good the story as 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.850
 follows and how it ends is a book that 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:28.030
 I highly recommend this author 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.710
 I loved it so I read 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.110
