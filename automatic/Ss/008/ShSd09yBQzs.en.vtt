00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.680

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.059
 we live on flowers né football flower 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.610

 We produce the cut roses right. 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.930
 project that was planted the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.090
 planting time 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.390
 already implemented the project that the project 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.559
 It's been hard for years, then, and then 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.480
 this already for May next year the already 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.760
 are planning to double production 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.620
 before the entrepreneur 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.660
 but I did not know how much I 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.490
 as knowing we are spending today 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.540
 exactly what you earn that you spend after 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.950
 rural inventor project taught us people 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.370
 manage our property as a 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.370
 company 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.200
 My family has this fiction already 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 almost 20 years ago in the municipality of 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.989
 candid of abreu 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.390
 we have the profitability of the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.030
 ownership is the raising of dairy cattle 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.680
 and also the extraction of wood from 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.630
 eucalyptus and pine 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.370
 our project is the implementation of the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.560
 beekeeping on my property. 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.659
 family showed her the vision of what people 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.090
 I had no problem about planning a budget 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.710
 and before it was all in the dark and there 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.510
 to do something does not even know where 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.930
 start for who to sell 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.580
 the project was possible is to analyze the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.640
 stock of natural capital 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.330
 the human and financial physicist and also 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.990
 making a history of the entire cycle of 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.290
 expenses and costs generated during each 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 year 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.079
 making the banana is a property 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.700
 which is located in the municipality of candói 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.689
 she belongs to my family since 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.210
 the 1950s it has 900 hectares 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.490
 today it works with beef cattle 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.159
 My project is raising the herd 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.560
 improvement in our rates in indexes 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.000
 productive is why I think the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.030
 main difficulty for producers 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.670
 today and not so much is technology and 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.310
 production but the control and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.019
 management and especially the costs 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.880
 so I believe I can do it today 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.620
 to see things better not only in the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.830
 technical part that was what I already had 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.910
 but also in this part of the cost of 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.680
 viability 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.140
 this knowledge may acquire 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.040
 through the entrepreneurial program 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 rural week 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.480
 the total area of ​​the property is 12 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.180
 alqueires my project is the implantation 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.940
 rotary picket with the enlargement of the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.040
 pasture area the objective is to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 principle of making productive property 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.209
 is that it is a family dream and increase the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.370
 family income 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.500
 before taking the course of the entrepreneur 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.570
 rural is to say that I had the mind 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.940
 Closer, right? 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.620
 the productivity here on the site was 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.769
 small was little but no one was 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.870
 doing nothing in the middle of the course my 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.940
 let's already say that it opened 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.970
 I already went there to talk to my 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.660
 Mom, we already had the idea. 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.880
 excited 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.600
 well, and we are there with a 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.180
 project launched to make 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.730
 milk activity and fattening of pigs 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.820
 Each partnership is 62 animals the total 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.950
 being 30 in order through the program 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.800
 entrepreneur where people analyze 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 the strengths and weaknesses of the property 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.430
 being a weakness then in the small 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.220
 area of ​​risk unit of property 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.710
 project is the construction in the confital bar 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.530
 for confinement of dairy cows 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.240
 with this project then I can 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.320
 confine my cows to get 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.320
 increase in milk production 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.240
 i am anderson i am emerson are the 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.330

 an area of ​​one hectare and a half we produce 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.210
 here on average about 1 admitted 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.440

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:10.190
 implementation of 15 greenhouses to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.680
 improving quality and reducing 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.920
 the risks in climatic conditions with 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.630
 such as the ever hail rain and 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.480
 this also an improvement in quality 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.290
 She's coming, we're here. 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.430
 wanting to start the party in the 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.430
 March 2014 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.150
 My family supported me because my father 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.210
 already did this course previously 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.980
 and when I received the invitation to 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.020
 participate in the p 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.080
 I asked my father what he thought 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.050
 And then he told me, look, if you 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.480
 can do this is very good because as 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.190
 he told me is that only knowledge 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.650
 You have to add, you do not lose right? 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.280
 Look at the project, we talked 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.830

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.270
 is the main source of income today. 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.060
 a faster return 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.460
 currently producing milk per day 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.460

 at least 250 milk per day 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.790
 with the implementation of the project I hope 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.800
 achieving an improvement in life 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.760

 has to have everything on the tip of the 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.170

 sang in my experience to learn more 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.910
 things to learn is to do project 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.540
 the devaluation of machinery and 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.440
 equipment 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.880
 I never thought about it, the project there is 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.420
 try to enlarge the area of 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.930
 posting and getting it done 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.360
 put more cattle in the fiber do today I 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.030
 I consider myself a good rural entrepreneur 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.570
 better than before and has never won 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.570
 it's too late to learn 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.390
 My name is priscila andriele boss ac 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.750
 The site is located in 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.540
 My father prudently copied it from my 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.910
 grandparents and is basically raising cattle from 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.490
 cut and my project went on top of 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.800
 beef cattle and also to diversify 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.170
 and to be able to increase this capacity of the palace 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.450
 to crop-livestock integration for 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.030
 also plan to plant soybeans in the 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.460
 People are going to start planting soybeans. 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.170
 to acquire new matrices to 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.030
 continuity and try to follow what was 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.800
 made on the project schedule 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.650
 today we are working with 70 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.140
 livestock with extensive 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.180
 project is we will split into 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.220
 increase the area to be able to 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.000
 acquire more matrices and be able to sell 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.000
 more animals 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.290
 I took the course that will have to do a 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.450
 project when milk activity is 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.700
 improve production conditions with the 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.770
 construction of shed and treatment room and 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.020
 milking and also with the enlargement of 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.120
 size of the good squad in question what 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.820
 needs to improve the milking place is a 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.389
 place is out of date. 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:21.120
 is in good condition and due to 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:23.580
 market demands for better 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.770
 quality of milk and also that they have more 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.600
 comfort to those who work there. 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.820
 good before the program had a thought 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.650
 it is thought that touching property is not 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.990
 that way I was thinking and today 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.720
 I see from other eyes that the question 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.850
 management are what are resources 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.139
 totally different from what 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:47.090
 I thought before 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:47.090
 Today I consider myself rather the rural entrepreneur
