Gallardo<00:03:12.440> Lamborghini<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.920> only

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
Gallardo Lamborghini is one of the only

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.890 
Gallardo Lamborghini is one of the only
cars<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.610> can<00:03:14.730> pull<00:03:14.970> off<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> garish<00:03:15.630> color

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
cars that can pull off a garish color

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.860 
cars that can pull off a garish color
scheme<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.260> I've<00:03:16.590> gone<00:03:16.769> with<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:16.980> lime<00:03:17.370> green

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
scheme so I've gone with that lime green

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.420 
scheme so I've gone with that lime green
like<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.900> mentioned<00:03:19.350> while<00:03:19.470> supercars<00:03:20.100> like

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
like I mentioned while supercars like

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
like I mentioned while supercars like
this<00:03:20.640> back<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.480> add<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.019> really

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
this back here and that add a really

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.990 
this back here and that add a really
fast<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.100> straight<00:03:23.130> line<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.579> don't<00:03:23.820> actually

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
fast in a straight line I don't actually

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.910 
fast in a straight line I don't actually
find<00:03:24.359> them<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.810> girl<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> corners<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
find them to girl on the corners and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
find them to girl on the corners and
it's<00:03:26.430> always<00:03:26.670> difficult<00:03:26.880> weaving<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.600> out

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
it's always difficult weaving in and out

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360 
it's always difficult weaving in and out
of<00:03:27.840> traffic<00:03:28.019> with<00:03:28.410> absolutely<00:03:28.859> wrecking<00:03:29.220> them

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
of traffic with absolutely wrecking them

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.340 
of traffic with absolutely wrecking them
so<00:03:30.239> with<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.570> mind<00:03:30.720> that's<00:03:30.900> why<00:03:31.049> I've<00:03:31.200> got

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
so with that in mind that's why I've got

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.470 
so with that in mind that's why I've got
some<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.709> these<00:03:31.890> smaller<00:03:32.340> sports<00:03:32.790> cars<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.239> my

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
it's not that extraordinary or

sought-after is the coil voltage which

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.279 
sought-after is the coil voltage which
is<00:04:17.519> based<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.090> Lotus<00:04:18.419> Elise<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.080> the

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
Tesla Roadster which is an electric car

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.820 
Tesla Roadster which is an electric car
in<00:04:21.510> real<00:04:21.720> life<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.229> that's<00:04:22.349> continued

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
in real life and that's continued

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.800 
in real life and that's continued
in-game<00:04:23.159> with<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.490> car

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
in-game with this car

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.970 
in-game with this car
so<00:04:23.870> I've<00:04:23.960> been<00:04:24.050> electric<00:04:24.500> as<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.800> name

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
so I've been electric as the name

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.250 
so I've been electric as the name
suggests<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:26.240> makes<00:04:26.480> driving<00:04:26.720> this<00:04:27.020> car

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
suggests this makes driving this car

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.409 
suggests this makes driving this car
quite<00:04:27.530> unique<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.250> there's<00:04:28.550> no<00:04:28.700> engine<00:04:28.880> sound

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
quite unique and there's no engine sound

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.450 
quite unique and there's no engine sound
and<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.260> actually<00:04:30.560> gets<00:04:30.710> up<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.010> speed<00:04:31.250> pretty

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
and it actually gets up to speed pretty

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.760 
and it actually gets up to speed pretty
fast<00:04:31.880> with<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.300> Vino<00:04:32.690> gearing<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.380> go<00:04:33.530> through

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
fast with the Vino gearing to go through

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.250 
fast with the Vino gearing to go through
also<00:04:34.700> being<00:04:34.940> pretty<00:04:35.090> small<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.720> nimble<00:04:35.870> makes

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
also being pretty small and nimble makes

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.020 
also being pretty small and nimble makes
it<00:04:36.470> great<00:04:36.680> for<00:04:36.740> weaving<00:04:37.280> in<00:04:37.370> there<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.639> traffic

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
it great for weaving in there of traffic

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.000 
it great for weaving in there of traffic
and<00:04:38.240> lane<00:04:38.419> splitting<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:39.110> those<00:04:39.260> highways<00:04:39.710> so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
and lane splitting on those highways so

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.650 
and lane splitting on those highways so
it's<00:04:40.160> always<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.430> car<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.700> look<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.060> take<00:04:41.240> out<00:04:41.480> on

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
it's always a car I look to take out on

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.120 
it's always a car I look to take out on
those<00:04:41.780> mountain<00:04:42.230> roads<00:04:42.470> or<00:04:42.770> just<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.040> go

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
those mountain roads or just to go

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.400 
those mountain roads or just to go
razzing<00:04:43.520> around<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.820> streets<00:04:44.350> this<00:04:45.350> is

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
razzing around the streets this is

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.810 
razzing around the streets this is
another<00:04:45.680> one<00:04:45.860> I've<00:04:45.950> tricked<00:04:46.190> out<00:04:46.400> with<00:04:46.430> new
