want to talk to you about using fish

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.230 
want to talk to you about using fish
fertilizer<00:00:04.560> or<00:00:04.859> fish<00:00:05.069> emulsion<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.120> your

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
fertilizer or fish emulsion in your

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.169 
fertilizer or fish emulsion in your
garden<00:00:06.629> it's<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.109> organic<00:00:07.890> fertilizer<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.670> did<00:00:09.150> a

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
garden it's a organic fertilizer I did a

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.970 
garden it's a organic fertilizer I did a
video<00:00:09.330> earlier<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.050> blood<00:00:10.320> meal<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.740> blood

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
video earlier on blood meal and blood

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.879 
video earlier on blood meal and blood
meal<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.400> an<00:00:11.610> insoluble<00:00:12.210> fertilizer<00:00:13.139> which

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
meal is an insoluble fertilizer which

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.829 
meal is an insoluble fertilizer which
supplies<00:00:14.280> nitrogen<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.030> insoluble<00:00:15.360> means

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
supplies nitrogen and insoluble means

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.260 
supplies nitrogen and insoluble means
that<00:00:16.440> it's<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> take<00:00:17.010> four<00:00:17.760> six<00:00:18.090> eight

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
that it's going to take four six eight

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.760 
that it's going to take four six eight
weeks<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> break<00:00:19.320> down<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> be

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
weeks for this to break down and be

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.700 
weeks for this to break down and be
ready<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:21.180> vegetables<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.470> fish

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
ready for your your vegetables the fish

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.250 
ready for your your vegetables the fish
fertilizer<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.519> soluble<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.359> water<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
fertilizer is soluble in water and it's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.080 
fertilizer is soluble in water and it's
fast-acting<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.099> means<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.550> nitrogen

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
fast-acting which means this nitrogen

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.720 
fast-acting which means this nitrogen
will<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.359> quickly<00:00:27.720> available<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.279> plants

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
will be quickly available to your plants

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.279 
will be quickly available to your plants
so<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> need<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> really<00:00:30.539> use<00:00:30.720> both<00:00:30.990> when

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
so you need to really use both when

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
so you need to really use both when
you're<00:00:31.410> gardening<00:00:31.769> I'm<00:00:32.460> doing<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> series<00:00:33.090> on

you're gardening I'm doing a series on

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
you're gardening I'm doing a series on
organic<00:00:33.930> fertilizers<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.190> reasons<00:00:35.579> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
organic fertilizers for two reasons I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.310 
organic fertilizers for two reasons I
talked<00:00:36.180> about<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> greenhouse<00:00:36.930> going

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
talked about I have a greenhouse going

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
talked about I have a greenhouse going
on<00:00:37.440> back<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:38.610> want<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.180> any

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
on back here and I don't want to put any

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
on back here and I don't want to put any
man-made<00:00:40.200> chemicals<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.980> pesticides<00:00:41.129> or

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
man-made chemicals or pesticides or

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
man-made chemicals or pesticides or
anything<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.780> are<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.530> just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
anything in there that are going to just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200 
anything in there that are going to just
sit<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.940> rain

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sit in there because I don't have rain

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.490 
sit in there because I don't have rain
coming<00:00:45.570> through<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> wash

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
coming through it's not going to wash

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.190 
coming through it's not going to wash
away<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> man-made<00:00:48.570> fertilizers

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
away some of the man-made fertilizers

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
away some of the man-made fertilizers
it's<00:00:49.379> also<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> wash<00:00:50.100> away<00:00:50.280> any

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's also not going to wash away any

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's also not going to wash away any
pesticide<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> try<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
pesticide so I'm going to try and go a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
pesticide so I'm going to try and go a
hundred<00:00:52.170> percent<00:00:52.230> organic<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> garden

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
hundred percent organic in that garden

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.350 
hundred percent organic in that garden
or<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.239> greenhouse<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.969> container

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
or in that greenhouse the container

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.959 
or in that greenhouse the container
plants<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.969> liquid

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
plants are going to need liquid

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
plants are going to need liquid
fertilizer<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.750> fish<00:01:00.960> emulsion<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
fertilizer so fish emulsion is the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.930 
fertilizer so fish emulsion is the
choice<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> let<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.430> tell<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> real

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
choice and let me just tell you real

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
choice and let me just tell you real
quickly<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.170> don't<00:01:04.350> already<00:01:04.470> know

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
quickly if you don't already know

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
quickly if you don't already know
there's<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> three<00:01:05.460> macro<00:01:05.850> ingredients<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
there's the three macro ingredients to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
there's the three macro ingredients to
fertilizer<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.200> nitrogen<00:01:07.710> phosphorus<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
fertilizer are nitrogen phosphorus and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
fertilizer are nitrogen phosphorus and
potassium<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.750> nitrogen<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.409> works<00:01:10.590> on

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
potassium the nitrogen really works on

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
potassium the nitrogen really works on
the<00:01:10.830> leaves<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.430> phosphorus<00:01:11.880> works<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the leaves the phosphorus works on the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
the leaves the phosphorus works on the
roots<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.290> potassium<00:01:13.590> works<00:01:14.040> works<00:01:14.460> on

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
roots and the potassium works works on

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
roots and the potassium works works on
the<00:01:14.760> regulating<00:01:15.390> systems<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> plants<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the regulating systems of the plants so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
the regulating systems of the plants so
that<00:01:16.830> they<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> move<00:01:17.340> nutrients<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> down

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that they can move nutrients up and down

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
that they can move nutrients up and down
throughout<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> plant<00:01:19.820> fish<00:01:20.820> emulsion<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
throughout the plant fish emulsion is a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
throughout the plant fish emulsion is a
five<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.650> which<00:01:22.950> means<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.430> five

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
five one one which means it's five

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.820 
five one one which means it's five
percent<00:01:24.450> per<00:01:24.600> pound<00:01:24.869> something<00:01:25.530> along<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
percent per pound something along that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 
percent per pound something along that
line<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.369> nitrogen<00:01:27.030> its<00:01:27.450> fast-acting<00:01:28.080> its

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
line of nitrogen its fast-acting its

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.010 
line of nitrogen its fast-acting its
water<00:01:28.920> soluble<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.090> mixed<00:01:30.570> into

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
water soluble so this is mixed into

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
water soluble so this is mixed into
water<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.590> pour<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.310> directly<00:01:32.640> onto<00:01:32.880> your

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
water you pour it directly onto your

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.990 
water you pour it directly onto your
plant<00:01:33.450> directly<00:01:34.290> into<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> soil<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
plant directly into the soil and the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.539 
plant directly into the soil and the
plant<00:01:36.270> will<00:01:36.420> quickly<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> nitrogen<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
plant will quickly get the nitrogen the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.940 
plant will quickly get the nitrogen the
other<00:01:38.670> thing<00:01:38.939> about<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.840> fish<00:01:40.079> fertilizer<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
other thing about the fish fertilizer is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.069 
other thing about the fish fertilizer is
the<00:01:41.610> application<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> apply<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
the application you want to apply it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
the application you want to apply it
every<00:01:43.380> two<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> three<00:01:43.950> weeks<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> two

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
every two to three weeks you put in two

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.060 
every two to three weeks you put in two
tablespoons<00:01:45.540> per<00:01:46.200> gallon<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.619> water<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
tablespoons per gallon of water and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
tablespoons per gallon of water and
again<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> stress<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
again I want to stress that this is a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.520 
again I want to stress that this is a
fast-acting<00:01:49.909> nitrogen<00:01:50.960> fertilizer<00:01:51.960> versus

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer versus

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer versus
blood<00:01:52.799> meal<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.670> insoluble<00:01:54.600> or

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
blood meal which is an insoluble or

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.870 
blood meal which is an insoluble or
long-acting<00:01:55.530> nitrogen<00:01:56.189> fertilizer<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
long-acting nitrogen fertilizer and you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
long-acting nitrogen fertilizer and you
really<00:01:57.119> need<00:01:57.299> both<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.899> one<00:01:58.200> isn't<00:01:58.649> ready

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
really need both this one isn't ready

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
really need both this one isn't ready
for<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> plant<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.450> pick<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.990> use

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
for the plant really to pick up and use

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.010 
for the plant really to pick up and use
for<00:02:01.619> many<00:02:02.100> many<00:02:02.310> weeks<00:02:02.570> once<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.689> put<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> in

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
for many many weeks once you put it in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.719 
for many many weeks once you put it in
the<00:02:04.079> garden<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.799> ready<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.610> know

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the garden this is ready you know

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.130 
the garden this is ready you know
essentially<00:02:06.090> once<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> pour<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.810> on

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
essentially once you pour it on

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.580 
essentially once you pour it on
it<00:02:07.649> also<00:02:07.799> has<00:02:08.509> 0.75<00:02:09.509> percent<00:02:09.690> non-soluble

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
it also has 0.75 percent non-soluble

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.030 
it also has 0.75 percent non-soluble
slowly<00:02:11.430> available<00:02:12.349> nitrogen<00:02:13.349> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
slowly available nitrogen so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.039 
slowly available nitrogen so
so<00:02:14.099> when<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:14.939> this<00:02:15.209> your<00:02:15.569> plant<00:02:15.840> will<00:02:16.019> be

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
so when you use this your plant will be

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.530 
so when you use this your plant will be
able<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:16.879> what<00:02:17.879> you're<00:02:18.000> putting<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.390> right

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
able to use what you're putting in right

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.360 
able to use what you're putting in right
away<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.109> also<00:02:19.260> has<00:02:19.530> some<00:02:19.560> nitrogen<00:02:20.099> that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
away and it also has some nitrogen that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.550 
away and it also has some nitrogen that
will<00:02:20.489> break<00:02:20.700> down<00:02:20.730> over<00:02:21.090> time<00:02:21.319> let<00:02:22.319> me<00:02:22.409> show

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
will break down over time let me show

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.110 
will break down over time let me show
you<00:02:22.650> what<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:22.890> looks<00:02:23.099> like<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.519> very<00:02:23.790> thick

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you what it looks like it's very thick

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.319 
you what it looks like it's very thick
it<00:02:24.870> does<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:26.219> know<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> fishy<00:02:26.700> smell<00:02:26.879> to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
it does have you know a fishy smell to

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:36.140 
it does have you know a fishy smell to
it<00:02:27.709> but<00:02:28.709> you're<00:02:28.890> using<00:02:31.040> two<00:02:32.040> tablespoons<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
it but you're using two tablespoons and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.819 
it but you're using two tablespoons and
just<00:02:36.450> put<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.750> down<00:02:36.810> you're<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> use

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
just put that down you're going to use

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.920 
just put that down you're going to use
two<00:02:38.099> tablespoons<00:02:38.310> per<00:02:39.090> gallon<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.540> water<00:02:39.599> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
two tablespoons per gallon of water and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.740 
two tablespoons per gallon of water and
once<00:02:40.049> it's<00:02:40.230> all<00:02:40.349> mixed<00:02:40.620> up<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:42.629> it

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
once it's all mixed up this is what it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.369 
once it's all mixed up this is what it
looks<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:44.599> so<00:02:45.599> you're<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.170> pour

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
looks like so you're just going to pour

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.500 
looks like so you're just going to pour
that<00:02:46.409> into<00:02:47.040> your<00:02:47.370> plant<00:02:47.609> soil<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.150> put<00:02:48.420> it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that into your plant soil you can put it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.379 
that into your plant soil you can put it
on<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:48.959> plant<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.579> is<00:02:50.730> an<00:02:50.819> organic
