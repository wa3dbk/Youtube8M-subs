00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.690

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.590

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650
 let's run to the right then I ran 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 where there is, that is, I broke all the limits 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 toy just simply vesa nola and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.500
 nothing happened but come on well 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.789
 sonic now we are in the role 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.429

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.890
 OK 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 we run to the right opa opa here already 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.489
 see something else and some 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.730
 figures and sound like modems before 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.730
 there were telephone modems when not whistling 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 starts here the same way some 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.670
 incomprehensible characters orgy in the back 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.190
 the background continues amplified what does 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 next will come on sonic screams too 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.979
 amplified music forces the atmosphere 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.979
 come on sony 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:28.840
 Well, we ran into a native sonic 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.020
 I want to cheer pattern chickens like daisy want 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.290
 again 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.340
 Japanese characters whose meaning I am 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.680
 I don't know at all without any idea whatsoever 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.080
 there will be something else and maybe 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.610
 no riddle riddle one developer 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.060
 only you know what could be next what 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.910
 there can be no further and why in general 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.520
 wrote these characters and what, after all, they 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.370
 means you can of course translate it all 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.650
 somehow drive in but this is death 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.190
 it will just be worse than a hundred times 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.450
 play it already the most sonic so well 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.119
 what is next you can do nothing 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.250
 it works here you see just unloading 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.600
 flew out and now we stumbled upon 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.630
 Sonic werewolves 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.800
 with sharp ears and big eyes 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.550
 red painting yes so well all that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.020
 it's all well 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.100
 nothing happens but that's all that's 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.470
 such a treshnyak such I expected 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.540
 much as it was advised by many 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.730
 I will play sonic.exe on the game sonic for this 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.860
 awesome scary souls iii exploded 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.410
 I put a chair under the table 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.820
 broke and so on well as you see already 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.860

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.500
 nothing happens press all buttons 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.980
 escape escape without a difference that is all 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.750
 Here is such a vyser Well, thank you all 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.920
 hopefully 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.080
 removed your thirst to find out what will happen 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.000
 Further, but nothing will happen next all 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000
