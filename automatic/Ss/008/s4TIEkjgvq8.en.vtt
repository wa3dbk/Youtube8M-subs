okay<00:02:05.420> well<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.780> can<00:02:05.930> clearly<00:02:06.200> see<00:02:06.560> here<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
okay well we can clearly see here on the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.000 
okay well we can clearly see here on the
meter<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> bass<00:02:12.709> drum

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
meter is that the you see the bass drum

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.470 
meter is that the you see the bass drum
and<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.190> snare<00:02:13.250> drum<00:02:13.700> driving<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> mix

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and the snare drum driving the mix

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.270 
and the snare drum driving the mix
pretty<00:02:14.750> seriously<00:02:15.410> but<00:02:15.590> yet<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.920> won't<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
pretty seriously but yet that won't the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.690 
pretty seriously but yet that won't the
whole<00:02:16.430> mix<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.850> unscathed<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:19.370> out<00:02:19.489> what

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
whole mix is unscathed you're out what

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.309 
whole mix is unscathed you're out what
I'll<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.120> I'll<00:02:20.270> roll<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.540> back<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.110> there's

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
I'll do is I'll roll it back so there's

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.780 
I'll do is I'll roll it back so there's
a<00:02:21.380> little<00:02:21.590> more<00:02:21.709> play<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> meter<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.580> can

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
a little more play in the meter you can

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.540 
a little more play in the meter you can
really<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.450> I'm<00:02:23.569> talking<00:02:23.900> about<00:02:24.550> there

drum are very loud in the mix and we can
see<00:02:34.459> both<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.730> those<00:02:35.030> instruments<00:02:35.530> hit<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
see both of those instruments hit the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820 
see both of those instruments hit the
compressor<00:02:37.130> pretty<00:02:37.340> hard<00:02:38.019> but<00:02:39.019> as<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.500> unit

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
compressor pretty hard but as the unit

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.470 
compressor pretty hard but as the unit
returns<00:02:40.220> only<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.940> senses<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.450> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.550 

no<00:03:10.470> problem<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:12.599> know<00:03:12.659> yeah<00:03:13.110> I've<00:03:13.200> got<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.440> say

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
no problem you know yeah I've got to say

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.559 
no problem you know yeah I've got to say
a<00:03:13.590> lot<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.860> times<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.489> want<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.879> lot<00:03:15.060> bass<00:03:15.269> drum

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
a lot of times you want a lot bass drum

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.720 
a lot of times you want a lot bass drum
in<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.720> mix<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.200> know<00:03:16.319> this<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.680> uh<00:03:16.709> goes<00:03:17.519> to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
in the mix you know this is uh goes to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.000 
in the mix you know this is uh goes to
the<00:03:17.819> rhythmic<00:03:18.030> content<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.739> overall

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
the rhythmic content of the the overall

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.699 
the rhythmic content of the the overall
mix<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.610> today<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.390> lot<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.810> what<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.170> see<00:03:22.409> and<00:03:22.620> a

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
mix and today a lot of what we see and a

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.530 
mix and today a lot of what we see and a
lot<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.920> what<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.129> hear<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.610> radio<00:03:23.730> is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
lot of what we hear on the radio is

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.240 
lot of what we hear on the radio is
music<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.349> so<00:03:25.500> compressed<00:03:25.980> it's

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
music that is so compressed it's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.680 
music that is so compressed it's
compressed<00:03:26.670> down<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.209> point<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.569> having

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
compressed down to the point of having

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.420 
compressed down to the point of having
the<00:03:27.900> dynamic<00:03:28.319> range<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.739> test<00:03:28.980> tone<00:03:29.190> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the dynamic range of a test tone and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.180 
the dynamic range of a test tone and
when<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.599> do<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.620> suck<00:03:31.890> all<00:03:32.069> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
when you do that you suck all the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.069 
when you do that you suck all the
rhythmic<00:03:32.760> contents<00:03:33.239> out<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> mix<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
rhythmic contents out of the mix and the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.050 
rhythmic contents out of the mix and the
MIT<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> music<00:03:34.860> becomes<00:03:35.159> less<00:03:35.459> exciting

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
MIT and the music becomes less exciting

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.220 
MIT and the music becomes less exciting
because<00:03:36.569> of<00:03:36.870> it

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
because of it

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.009 
because of it
typically<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:38.069> loud<00:03:38.549> bass<00:03:38.819> drum<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.540> going<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
typically a loud bass drum is going to

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.539 
typically a loud bass drum is going to
make<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.290> sound<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.650> there's<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.950> duck<00:03:41.250> or<00:03:41.400> on

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
make it sound like there's a duck or on

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.660 
make it sound like there's a duck or on
the<00:03:41.670> vocal<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.870> even<00:03:43.440> worse<00:03:43.680> sometimes<00:03:44.129> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
the vocal and even worse sometimes the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.520 
the vocal and even worse sometimes the
bass<00:03:44.819> drum<00:03:45.090> will<00:03:45.269> pull<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.750> whole<00:03:45.930> mix<00:03:46.260> down

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
bass drum will pull the whole mix down

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.710 
bass drum will pull the whole mix down
not<00:03:47.160> only<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.579> track<00:03:47.819> that's<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.209> loudest<00:03:48.359> in

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
not only the track that's the loudest in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.869 
not only the track that's the loudest in
the<00:03:48.810> mix<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:49.590> with<00:03:49.950> each<00:03:50.099> bass<00:03:50.370> drum<00:03:50.640> hit

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
the mix but with each bass drum hit

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.210 
the mix but with each bass drum hit
you'll<00:03:51.390> hear<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.750> whole<00:03:51.900> mix<00:03:52.200> go<00:03:52.709> down<00:03:52.950> and

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
you'll hear the whole mix go down and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.309 
you'll hear the whole mix go down and
the<00:03:53.940> really<00:03:54.359> only<00:03:54.480> solution<00:03:55.049> for<00:03:55.230> that

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
the really only solution for that

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.069 
the really only solution for that
usually<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.159> high-pass<00:03:56.549> filter<00:03:57.000> here<00:03:57.840> we

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
usually is a high-pass filter here we

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.630 
usually is a high-pass filter here we
don't<00:03:58.349> have<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.680> patch<00:03:58.859> in<00:03:59.099> a<00:03:59.190> whole<00:03:59.340> bunch<00:03:59.549> of

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
don't have to patch in a whole bunch of

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.569 
don't have to patch in a whole bunch of
extra<00:03:59.840> electronics<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.709> know<00:04:01.859> which<00:04:02.010> are<00:04:02.190> you

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
extra electronics you know which are you

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.660 
extra electronics you know which are you
know<00:04:02.640> dirtying<00:04:03.209> up<00:04:03.299> our<00:04:03.480> mix<00:04:03.659> if<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.670> you

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
know dirtying up our mix if we can you

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.670 
know dirtying up our mix if we can you
know<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.180> use<00:04:06.480> as<00:04:06.720> few<00:04:07.049> electronics<00:04:07.590> as

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
know you use as few electronics as

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.860 
know you use as few electronics as
possible<00:04:08.129> on<00:04:08.310> our<00:04:08.370> on<00:04:08.790> our<00:04:08.819> main<00:04:09.269> stereo<00:04:09.599> bus

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
possible on our on our main stereo bus

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.660 
possible on our on our main stereo bus
we're<00:04:10.049> better<00:04:10.230> off<00:04:10.409> so<00:04:10.799> even<00:04:11.310> if<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.640> a

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
we're better off so even if you have a

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.670 
we're better off so even if you have a
lot<00:04:11.909> of<00:04:11.940> bass<00:04:12.180> drum<00:04:12.480> you'll<00:04:13.019> notice<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.500> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
lot of bass drum you'll notice that the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.559 
lot of bass drum you'll notice that the
rest<00:04:13.859> of<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.099> mix<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.459> completely<00:04:14.880> unscathed

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
rest of the mix is completely unscathed

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.629 
rest of the mix is completely unscathed
you<00:04:15.959> won't<00:04:16.169> hear<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.410> typical<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.519> know

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
you won't hear that typical you know

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.089 
you won't hear that typical you know
drop<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.479> level<00:04:18.900> every<00:04:19.440> time<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> bass<00:04:19.859> drum

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
drop in a level every time the bass drum

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.770 
drop in a level every time the bass drum
hits<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.760> unbelievable<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.450> mean<00:04:21.630> what

too I did you know I you know we've all

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.909 
too I did you know I you know we've all
had<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.090> patch<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.599> you<00:04:31.260> know<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.440> sea<00:04:31.889> of

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
had the patch in you know a sea of

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.180 
had the patch in you know a sea of
cables<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:33.270> processors<00:04:34.139> sometimes<00:04:34.620> we<00:04:34.860> you

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
cables and processors sometimes we you

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.500 
cables and processors sometimes we you
know<00:04:35.310> we<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.490> keep<00:04:35.849> patching<00:04:36.090> in<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
know we just keep patching in a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.510 
know we just keep patching in a
different<00:04:36.930> solution<00:04:37.440> for<00:04:37.680> every<00:04:38.099> problem

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
different solution for every problem

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.029 
different solution for every problem
that<00:04:38.550> we<00:04:38.820> encounter<00:04:39.419> I'm<00:04:40.320> amazed<00:04:40.710> at<00:04:40.979> the

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
that we encounter I'm amazed at the

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.580 
that we encounter I'm amazed at the
simplicity<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.880> unit<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.479> it<00:04:43.169> looks

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
simplicity of the unit it it looks

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.620 
simplicity of the unit it it looks
