00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi to all his followers so 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.690
 today little video the blues a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.030
 question where at the same time I'm just doing 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.580
 mix is my club and so do it in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.769
 did I find a site finally there 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.700
 are there youtuber who they said for 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.369
 order the cubes 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.630
 so he was talking about 51 more fun so by 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.269
 if you have already ordered 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 I wish we could say if the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.680
 delivery is fast and on time 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 if it's secure enough because 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 I would like to order it because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.489
 that there is for example the word you well 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 world we find really expensive 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.230
 on amazon so where I order 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 regularly my tubes 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.610
 so you really do not know if it's 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.950
 secure so I do not know if I 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590
 will buy on it but if ever 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.239
 you tell me it's good there's no problem 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 I will order I will do a lot 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.890
 of a boxing because there are really 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.059
 cubes cheap so I would like to buy myself 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.489
 a word your way long and a timer because 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 that I do not have one and it's soothing 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.970
 this time but very with waiting 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.970
 germond much sought after 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.760
 so that's actually the application 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.920
 this one is really boring because 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.659
 that sometimes this step it super 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.140
 you start year ended 15 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.860
 seconds 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.170
 he sees the bend the bug I do not know 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.909
 sometimes it's dust on on the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.240
 little button so on these two tips and 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.460
 So it stops and it annoys it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.200
 irritates many many many here 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.729
 so he would like to buy me a 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.560
 timer so here is it he started by 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.539
 example it is I do not see the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.860
 stopwatch I put my fingers that he 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.149
 release actually the stopwatch he 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.869
 stop i'm doing it so what are you 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.030
 that's why I 'm going to buy a 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.940
 tailor so preferably a good qg 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.179
 it's the best anyway so 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.910
 I also order on amazon owens or 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.650
 4 x 4 so there will be a boxing nest there 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:15.190
 above yeah soon either Thursday or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.810

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.050

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.650

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.170

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.700
