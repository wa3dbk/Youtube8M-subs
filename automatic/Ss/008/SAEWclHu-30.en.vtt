Charlestown<00:03:54.730> Chester<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:56.170> think<00:03:56.410> that's<00:03:56.769> a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
Charlestown Chester so I think that's a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.990 
Charlestown Chester so I think that's a
win-win<00:03:57.100> scenario<00:03:57.489> for<00:03:58.000> everyone<00:03:58.330> involved

win-win scenario for everyone involved

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.570 
win-win scenario for everyone involved
it's<00:04:01.000> crunchy<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:02.590> still<00:04:02.920> has<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.130> vanilla

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
it's crunchy it still has that vanilla

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.190 
it's crunchy it still has that vanilla
taste<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.000> doesn't<00:04:04.330> quite<00:04:04.570> give<00:04:04.840> me<00:04:04.989> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
taste it doesn't quite give me the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.699 
taste it doesn't quite give me the
seaside<00:04:06.070> fudge<00:04:06.430> feel<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.480> non<00:04:08.019> frozen<00:04:08.530> bar

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
seaside fudge feel but a non frozen bar

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.729 
seaside fudge feel but a non frozen bar
gives<00:04:08.950> me<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.660> surprisingly<00:04:11.320> good

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
gives me but it's surprisingly good

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.460 
gives me but it's surprisingly good
now<00:04:12.670> if<00:04:12.880> Americans<00:04:13.390> think<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.780> issue<00:04:13.930> then

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
now if Americans think this issue then

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.469 
now if Americans think this issue then
suddenly<00:04:15.040> I've<00:04:15.280> lost<00:04:15.519> all<00:04:15.730> credibility<00:04:15.850> as<00:04:16.450> a

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
frozen bar a bar that has been in the

frozen bar a bar that has been in the
freezer<00:05:14.320> for<00:05:14.470> at<00:05:14.680> least<00:05:14.889> two<00:05:15.520> hours<00:05:16.380> I'm<00:05:17.380> gonna

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
freezer for at least two hours I'm gonna

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.629 
freezer for at least two hours I'm gonna
give<00:05:18.419> eight<00:05:19.419> out<00:05:19.780> of<00:05:19.810> ten<00:05:20.310> because<00:05:21.310> although

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
give eight out of ten because although

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.310 
give eight out of ten because although
it<00:05:21.820> doesn't<00:05:22.090> have<00:05:22.240> that<00:05:22.419> most<00:05:22.570> algae<00:05:22.930> factor

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
it doesn't have that most algae factor

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.260 
it doesn't have that most algae factor
the<00:05:23.950> fact<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.280> it<00:05:24.370> retains<00:05:24.700> so<00:05:24.880> much<00:05:25.030> flavor

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
the fact that it retains so much flavor

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.180 
the fact that it retains so much flavor
and<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.570> fact<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:25.960> tastes<00:05:26.290> so<00:05:26.500> distinct

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
and the fact that it tastes so distinct

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.150 
and the fact that it tastes so distinct
I<00:05:28.229> think<00:05:29.229> I<00:05:29.350> think<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.620> frozen<00:05:30.010> bar

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
I think I think the frozen bar

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.390 
I think I think the frozen bar
definitely<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.960> definitely<00:05:32.169> better<00:05:32.590> than<00:05:32.979> an

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
definitely is definitely better than an

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.770 
definitely is definitely better than an
unfrozen<00:05:33.669> but<00:05:33.940> they're<00:05:34.060> still<00:05:34.180> very<00:05:34.240> good<00:05:34.630> and

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
unfrozen but they're still very good and

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.969 
unfrozen but they're still very good and
I<00:05:34.810> would<00:05:34.870> still<00:05:35.169> walk<00:05:35.320> into<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.560> store<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.860> buy

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
I would still walk into a store and buy

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.790 
I would still walk into a store and buy
one<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.160> these<00:05:36.340> but<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:38.080> definitely<00:05:38.229> benefits

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
one of these but it definitely benefits

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.380 
one of these but it definitely benefits
from<00:05:38.890> a<00:05:38.979> couple<00:05:39.190> of<00:05:39.280> hours<00:05:39.610> in<00:05:39.760> cold<00:05:39.940> storage

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
from a couple of hours in cold storage

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.690 
from a couple of hours in cold storage
so<00:05:40.630> that's<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.830> for<00:05:41.950> this<00:05:42.070> week<00:05:42.310> let<00:05:42.520> me<00:05:42.580> know
