even care and that's halftime boys one

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
even care and that's halftime boys one
thing<00:01:29.520> I've<00:01:29.610> noticed<00:01:29.729> about<00:01:29.939> mid<00:01:30.210> city<00:01:30.450> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
thing I've noticed about mid city in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
thing I've noticed about mid city in
this<00:01:31.079> leg<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.729> their<00:01:32.850> top<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this leg is that their top of a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
this leg is that their top of a
breakdown<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.950> you'd<00:01:35.220> think

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
breakdown and that's that you'd think

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
breakdown and that's that you'd think
that<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> smart<00:01:36.090> tactic<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that that's a smart tactic but you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
that that's a smart tactic but you
actually<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.530> about<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.250> stupid

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually think about it's kind of stupid

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
actually think about it's kind of stupid
why<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:39.659> defending<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.500> much<00:01:40.740> when

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
why are they defending so much when

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
why are they defending so much when
they're<00:01:41.189> four<00:01:41.520> nil<00:01:41.820> down<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.390> they

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they're four nil down are they

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
they're four nil down are they
forgetting<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.049> therefore<00:01:43.259> kneel<00:01:43.710> down<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
forgetting that therefore kneel down I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.340 
forgetting that therefore kneel down I
think<00:01:45.119> that's<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.600> altered<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.079> think<00:01:46.259> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
think that's all my altered I think that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.870 
think that's all my altered I think that
computers<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.130> ultra<00:01:47.430> defensive

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
computers put it on ultra defensive

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.630 
computers put it on ultra defensive
which<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.329> absolutely<00:01:48.630> weird<00:01:49.170> because

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
which is just absolutely weird because

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.100 
which is just absolutely weird because
they<00:01:50.640> need<00:01:50.880> goals<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.509> should<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.930> out

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
they need goals they should be all out

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
they need goals they should be all out
attacking<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.799> they've<00:01:53.220> only<00:01:53.340> take<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.670> two

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
attacking and they've only take them two

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
attacking and they've only take them two
shots<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> neither<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.320> yeah

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
shots and neither in one time so yeah

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.190 
shots and neither in one time so yeah
half<00:01:56.340> time<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.759> nil<00:01:56.969> nil<00:01:57.210> which<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.689> fine<00:01:58.140> with

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
half time is nil nil which I'm fine with

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.149 
half time is nil nil which I'm fine with
I<00:01:58.469> mean<00:01:58.770> we're<00:01:58.920> formal<00:01:59.399> up<00:02:00.829> but<00:02:01.829> yeah<00:02:01.979> it's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I mean we're formal up but yeah it's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.260 
I mean we're formal up but yeah it's
been<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> weird<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.969> they've<00:02:03.119> been

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
been kind of weird that they've been

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.940 
been kind of weird that they've been
playing<00:02:03.479> defensive<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.320> therefore<00:02:04.500> nailed

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
playing defensive when therefore nailed

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
playing defensive when therefore nailed
down<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.969> they<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
down like you think that they go for a I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
down like you think that they go for a I
don't<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.740> i'm<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.220> sure<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.580> let's<00:02:08.670> head

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
the sense that they play defensive I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.080 
the sense that they play defensive I

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
have a good feeling about the Champions

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.650 
have a good feeling about the Champions
League<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.490> there<00:02:43.610> are<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> few<00:02:44.000> teams<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.540> I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
League and there are a few teams that I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.450 
League and there are a few teams that I
think<00:02:44.900> could<00:02:45.140> give<00:02:45.740> us<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.920> bit<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.190> scare<00:02:46.430> but

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
think could give us a bit of a scare but

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.670 
think could give us a bit of a scare but
let's<00:02:46.790> take<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> look<00:02:47.060> at<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.210> bracket<00:02:47.680> Chelsea

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
let's take a look at the bracket Chelsea

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.400 
let's take a look at the bracket Chelsea
obliterate<00:02:49.430> Napoli<00:02:49.940> 61<00:02:50.600> arsenal<00:02:51.260> beat

obliterate Napoli 61 arsenal beat

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.100 
obliterate Napoli 61 arsenal beat
Dallben<00:02:51.920> 3-1<00:02:52.520> on<00:02:52.670> aggregate<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:53.450> that's

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
Dallben 3-1 on aggregate that's that's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.160 
Dallben 3-1 on aggregate that's that's
not<00:02:54.230> believable<00:02:54.760> Madrid<00:02:55.760> beat<00:02:56.000> Liverpool<00:02:56.540> 42

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
not believable Madrid beat Liverpool 42

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.630 
not believable Madrid beat Liverpool 42
which<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.650> real<00:02:57.860> life<00:02:58.070> they're<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.460> same

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
which in real life they're in the same

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.120 
which in real life they're in the same
group<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.390> that's<00:02:59.570> not<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.230> happen<00:03:00.350> but

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
group so that's not going to happen but

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.830 
group so that's not going to happen but
I<00:03:01.190> think<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:01.970> game<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.660> same

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
I think in this game then on the same

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.270 
I think in this game then on the same
group<00:03:03.340> buying<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.820> CSK<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.690> another<00:03:06.590> two<00:03:06.980> teams

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
group buying and CSK a another two teams

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.160 
group buying and CSK a another two teams
that<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.580> same<00:03:07.700> group<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.060> real<00:03:08.210> life<00:03:08.420> by

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
that are the same group in real life by

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.320 
that are the same group in real life by
am<00:03:09.350> pretty<00:03:09.950> unsurprisingly<00:03:10.790> goes<00:03:11.030> through

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
am pretty unsurprisingly goes through

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.590 
am pretty unsurprisingly goes through
