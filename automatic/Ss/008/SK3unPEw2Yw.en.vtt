these big set piece of evolution events
I<00:02:21.090> would<00:02:21.299> prefer<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.140> tad<00:02:22.769> more<00:02:22.819> destruction

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
I would prefer a tad more destruction

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.180 
I would prefer a tad more destruction

destruction in a battlefield game it's

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.780 
destruction in a battlefield game it's
one<00:02:55.139> of<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.409> unique<00:02:55.709> selling<00:02:56.189> points<00:02:56.549> that

one of the unique selling points that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.929 
one of the unique selling points that
has<00:02:57.060> over<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.599> years<00:02:58.310> separated<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> from<00:02:59.459> its

competitors but on the same know why I

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.240 
competitors but on the same know why I
love<00:03:03.420> destruction<00:03:04.109> in<00:03:04.200> battlefield<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.859> as<00:03:05.129> I

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
love destruction in battlefield and as I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.280 
love destruction in battlefield and as I
said<00:03:05.310> earlier<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.760> think<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.299> distinguishes<00:03:06.989> it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
said earlier I think it distinguishes it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.229 
said earlier I think it distinguishes it
from<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:08.370> multiplayer<00:03:08.969> first-person

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
shooter games is it really always the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.420 
shooter games is it really always the
more<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.659> merrier<00:03:13.079> with<00:03:13.319> destruction<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.129> put

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
more the merrier with destruction I put

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.789 
more the merrier with destruction I put
tweet<00:03:14.790> out<00:03:15.090> earlier<00:03:15.569> speaking<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.620> people

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
tweet out earlier speaking to people

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.429 
tweet out earlier speaking to people
about<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.849> generally<00:03:18.840> people<00:03:19.079> seem<00:03:19.409> to

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
about this and generally people seem to

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.259 
about this and generally people seem to
think<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.859> was<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.250> more<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.609> merrier<00:03:20.939> more

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
think it was the more the merrier more

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
think it was the more the merrier more
destruction<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.079> better<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.469> game<00:03:22.500> but<00:03:23.400> I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
destruction the better the game but I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.030 
destruction the better the game but I
suppose<00:03:23.819> my<00:03:24.030> question<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.719> you<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.650> that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
suppose my question to you is is that

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.129 
suppose my question to you is is that
really<00:03:26.489> true<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.209> more<00:03:27.419> the<00:03:27.569> merrier<00:03:27.930> with

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
really true the more the merrier with

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.770 
really true the more the merrier with
destruction<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:29.030> level<00:03:30.030> design<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.719> a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
destruction because level design is a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.470 
destruction because level design is a
fine<00:03:31.530> art<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.129> we<00:03:32.250> remember<00:03:32.669> classic<00:03:33.150> maps

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
fine art and we remember classic maps

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.890 
fine art and we remember classic maps
forever<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> engagements<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.689> way

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
forever for the engagements and the way

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.289 
forever for the engagements and the way
the<00:03:37.139> combat<00:03:37.560> lays<00:03:37.799> out<00:03:38.040> i<00:03:38.099> mean<00:03:38.400> i<00:03:38.519> say<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.819> fine

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
the combat lays out i mean i say to fine

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.780 
the combat lays out i mean i say to fine
up<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> guess<00:03:40.049> it's<00:03:40.260> very<00:03:40.500> much<00:03:40.790> science

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
up but I guess it's very much science

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.809 
up but I guess it's very much science
meeting<00:03:42.269> up<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.079> ultimately<00:03:43.620> if<00:03:44.280> every

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.879

single building can be floor to the
ground<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.879> would<00:03:48.060> end<00:03:48.359> up<00:03:48.569> with<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.840> map<00:03:49.199> which

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
ground you would end up with a map which

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.819 
ground you would end up with a map which
is<00:03:49.739> just<00:03:49.949> a<00:03:50.269> level<00:03:51.269> battlefield<00:03:51.989> with<00:03:52.319> hardly

out the way combats will play out and

out the way combats will play out and

tried to make it both balanced and fun
and<00:04:08.759> give<00:04:09.060> ways<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.900> flank<00:04:10.139> around<00:04:10.379> and<00:04:10.799> if

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
and give ways to flank around and if

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.460 
and give ways to flank around and if
every<00:04:11.639> single<00:04:12.120> building<00:04:12.389> can<00:04:12.810> be<00:04:12.840> destroyed

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
every single building can be destroyed

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.069 
every single building can be destroyed
would<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.069> be<00:04:14.370> as<00:04:14.519> fun<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.030> thinking<00:04:15.840> back<00:04:15.870> to

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
would it be as fun and thinking back to

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.170 
would it be as fun and thinking back to
bad<00:04:16.440> company<00:04:16.949> 2<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.579> as<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.940> said<00:04:18.000> earlier

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
bad company 2 and as I said earlier

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.719 
bad company 2 and as I said earlier
whilst<00:04:19.049> many<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.949> buildings<00:04:20.130> could<00:04:20.579> be

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
whilst many of the buildings could be

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.969 
whilst many of the buildings could be
destroyed<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.389> wasn't<00:04:21.870> always<00:04:22.079> quite<00:04:22.620> all<00:04:22.919> of

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
destroyed it wasn't always quite all of

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.189 
destroyed it wasn't always quite all of
the<00:04:23.490> buildings<00:04:23.909> it<00:04:24.180> was<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.509> many<00:04:24.720> of<00:04:24.930> them

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
the buildings it was just many of them

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.080 
the buildings it was just many of them
and<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:26.009> guess<00:04:26.220> if<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.490> think<00:04:26.759> about<00:04:26.909> it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
and I guess if you think about it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.480 
and I guess if you think about it
ultimately<00:04:27.900> if<00:04:28.229> every<00:04:28.710> single<00:04:29.190> building

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
ultimately if every single building

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.640 
ultimately if every single building
could<00:04:29.909> be<00:04:30.210> leveled<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.720> ground<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.259> be

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
could be leveled to the ground and be

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.939 
could be leveled to the ground and be
within<00:04:31.889> our<00:04:32.130> control<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:33.120> destroy<00:04:33.800> then<00:04:34.800> there

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
within our control to destroy then there

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.279 
within our control to destroy then there
wouldn't<00:04:35.250> be<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> lot<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:35.849> originality<00:04:36.570> between

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
wouldn't be a lot of originality between

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.600 
wouldn't be a lot of originality between
the<00:04:37.409> maps<00:04:37.590> they<00:04:37.770> could<00:04:37.919> almost<00:04:38.070> become<00:04:38.580> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
the maps they could almost become a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.520 
the maps they could almost become a
little<00:04:38.909> bit<00:04:39.060> bland<00:04:39.330> they<00:04:39.810> could<00:04:39.990> all<00:04:40.139> play<00:04:40.380> out

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
little bit bland they could all play out

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.529 
little bit bland they could all play out
in<00:04:40.710> quite<00:04:40.949> a<00:04:40.979> similar<00:04:41.490> way<00:04:41.639> with<00:04:42.120> lots<00:04:42.389> of

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
in quite a similar way with lots of

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.570 
in quite a similar way with lots of
people<00:04:42.900> rushing<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.560> destroy<00:04:44.070> all<00:04:44.370> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
people rushing to destroy all the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.209 
people rushing to destroy all the
buildings<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.270> not<00:04:45.960> giving<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.500> different

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.219 
buildings and not giving you different

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.439 
buildings and not giving you different
areas<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.169> elevation<00:04:49.169> or<00:04:49.320> different<00:04:49.710> points

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
areas of elevation or different points

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.570 
areas of elevation or different points
you<00:04:50.509> flank<00:04:50.840> around<00:04:51.050> it's<00:04:51.529> a<00:04:51.650> very<00:04:51.889> complex

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
you flank around it's a very complex

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.179 
you flank around it's a very complex
issue<00:04:52.819> because<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:53.960> can<00:04:54.139> love<00:04:54.590> destruction

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189 
issue because you can love destruction

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.040 
issue because you can love destruction
as<00:04:55.340> I'm<00:04:55.490> sure<00:04:55.520> most<00:04:55.849> of<00:04:55.999> you<00:04:56.090> watching<00:04:56.509> this<00:04:56.659> do

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
as I'm sure most of you watching this do

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.700 
as I'm sure most of you watching this do
but<00:04:57.770> also<00:04:57.979> is<00:04:58.969> there<00:04:59.389> room<00:04:59.659> to<00:04:59.719> say<00:05:00.169> some

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
but also is there room to say some

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.769 
but also is there room to say some
buildings<00:05:01.039> just<00:05:01.400> shouldn't<00:05:02.059> be<00:05:02.240> destroyed

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779 
buildings just shouldn't be destroyed

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.980 
buildings just shouldn't be destroyed
now<00:05:03.559> bringing<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:04.189> back<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.849> dust<00:05:05.509> bowl<00:05:05.749> in

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
now bringing that back to dust bowl in

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.110 
now bringing that back to dust bowl in
battlefield<00:05:06.529> hardline<00:05:07.039> and<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.669> think<00:05:07.969> the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
battlefield hardline and I think the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.749 
battlefield hardline and I think the
real<00:05:08.360> issue<00:05:08.689> with<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.199> Motel<00:05:09.860> flag<00:05:10.219> the

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
real issue with that Motel flag the

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.969 
real issue with that Motel flag the
buildings<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.330> can't<00:05:11.629> be<00:05:11.809> destroyed<00:05:12.259> it's

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
buildings that can't be destroyed it's

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.249 
buildings that can't be destroyed it's
not<00:05:13.249> that<00:05:13.490> they're<00:05:13.669> indestructible<00:05:14.300> but<00:05:15.169> the

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
not that they're indestructible but the

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.649 
not that they're indestructible but the
problem<00:05:15.680> is<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.860> they<00:05:16.279> look<00:05:16.819> destructible

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
problem is that they look destructible

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.140 
problem is that they look destructible
and<00:05:17.900> are<00:05:18.169> indestructible<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:19.400> what<00:05:19.879> I<00:05:19.909> mean

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
and are indestructible and what I mean

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.540 
and are indestructible and what I mean
by<00:05:20.210> that<00:05:20.389> is<00:05:21.169> it's<00:05:21.469> not<00:05:21.710> as<00:05:21.770> though<00:05:21.949> they're

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
by that is it's not as though they're

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.420 
by that is it's not as though they're
built<00:05:22.789> out<00:05:22.999> of<00:05:23.029> some<00:05:23.300> solid<00:05:23.870> concrete<00:05:24.430> walls

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
built out of some solid concrete walls

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.110 
built out of some solid concrete walls
that<00:05:26.240> look<00:05:26.569> like<00:05:26.839> an<00:05:27.169> m320<00:05:27.979> probably<00:05:28.580> wouldn't

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
that look like an m320 probably wouldn't

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.300 
that look like an m320 probably wouldn't
be<00:05:29.300> able<00:05:29.389> to<00:05:29.629> blow<00:05:29.749> a<00:05:29.839> hole<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.499> but<00:05:31.159> they

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
be able to blow a hole in it but they

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.179 
be able to blow a hole in it but they
look<00:05:31.580> flimsy<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:32.419> they<00:05:32.599> look<00:05:32.930> as<00:05:33.199> though<00:05:33.499> you

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
look flimsy and they look as though you

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.890 
look flimsy and they look as though you
should<00:05:34.460> be<00:05:34.610> able<00:05:34.699> to<00:05:34.909> blow<00:05:35.029> a<00:05:35.120> hole<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.419> it<00:05:35.779> and

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
should be able to blow a hole in it and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.890 
should be able to blow a hole in it and
open<00:05:36.650> up<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.889> new<00:05:36.919> route<00:05:37.370> in<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.240> suppose<00:05:38.629> the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
open up a new route in so I suppose the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.619 
open up a new route in so I suppose the
issue<00:05:39.080> in<00:05:39.560> that<00:05:40.009> sense<00:05:40.400> is<00:05:40.639> more<00:05:40.909> an<00:05:41.029> artistic

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
issue in that sense is more an artistic

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.439 
issue in that sense is more an artistic
one<00:05:41.870> it's<00:05:42.409> more<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.860> artistic<00:05:43.460> design<00:05:43.969> of<00:05:44.300> the

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
one it's more the artistic design of the

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.540 
one it's more the artistic design of the
actual<00:05:44.749> building<00:05:44.960> if<00:05:45.589> the<00:05:45.860> building<00:05:46.310> looked

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
actual building if the building looked

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.939 
actual building if the building looked
like<00:05:46.729> it<00:05:46.939> was<00:05:47.029> made<00:05:47.210> out<00:05:47.479> so<00:05:47.949> reinforced

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
like it was made out so reinforced

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.279 
like it was made out so reinforced
concrete<00:05:49.189> it<00:05:49.759> wouldn't<00:05:50.149> be<00:05:50.210> so<00:05:50.479> jarring<00:05:50.930> it

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
concrete it wouldn't be so jarring it

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.950 
concrete it wouldn't be so jarring it
wouldn't<00:05:51.649> pull<00:05:52.189> you<00:05:52.370> out<00:05:52.520> of<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.729> fantasy<00:05:53.389> of

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
wouldn't pull you out of that fantasy of

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.629 
wouldn't pull you out of that fantasy of
the<00:05:54.259> first<00:05:54.499> person<00:05:54.979> shooter<00:05:55.249> and<00:05:55.460> make<00:05:55.550> you

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
the first person shooter and make you

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.249 
the first person shooter and make you
feel<00:05:55.789> all<00:05:55.939> hang<00:05:56.149> on<00:05:56.300> that<00:05:56.479> doesn't<00:05:56.629> seem<00:05:57.229> right

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
feel all hang on that doesn't seem right

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.279 
feel all hang on that doesn't seem right
that<00:05:57.560> doesn't<00:05:57.830> seem<00:05:58.300> realistic<00:05:59.300> that<00:06:00.050> that

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
that doesn't seem realistic that that

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.230 
that doesn't seem realistic that that
m320<00:06:01.249> won't<00:06:01.490> blow<00:06:01.699> through<00:06:01.939> that<00:06:02.089> wall

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
m320 won't blow through that wall

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.749 
m320 won't blow through that wall
because<00:06:02.599> we<00:06:02.839> do<00:06:03.560> become<00:06:03.949> used<00:06:04.249> to<00:06:04.399> in

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
because we do become used to in

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.489 
because we do become used to in
battlefield<00:06:05.300> what<00:06:05.659> wolves<00:06:05.959> can<00:06:06.319> be

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:06.499 
battlefield what wolves can be

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.980 
battlefield what wolves can be
destructible<00:06:07.189> and<00:06:07.459> what<00:06:07.610> can't<00:06:07.909> and<00:06:08.240> some<00:06:08.959> of

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
destructible and what can't and some of

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.829 
destructible and what can't and some of
the<00:06:09.229> walls<00:06:09.469> look<00:06:09.919> destructible<00:06:10.699> and<00:06:10.939> armed<00:06:11.180> so

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:11.839 
the walls look destructible and armed so

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.439 
the walls look destructible and armed so
maybe<00:06:12.110> from<00:06:12.469> an<00:06:12.560> artistic<00:06:12.860> standpoint<00:06:13.449> just

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
maybe from an artistic standpoint just

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.659 
maybe from an artistic standpoint just
change<00:06:14.749> the<00:06:14.990> way<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.349> walls<00:06:15.560> look<00:06:15.919> make<00:06:16.430> them

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
change the way the walls look make them

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.089 
change the way the walls look make them
look<00:06:16.849> like<00:06:17.089> solid<00:06:17.719> bloody<00:06:17.930> concrete<00:06:18.529> bunker

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
look like solid bloody concrete bunker

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.489 
look like solid bloody concrete bunker
walls<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:20.089> those<00:06:20.270> are<00:06:20.300> really<00:06:20.659> my<00:06:20.959> thoughts<00:06:21.289> on

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:21.499 
walls so those are really my thoughts on

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:22.839 
walls so those are really my thoughts on
destruction<00:06:21.919> in<00:06:22.159> battlefield<00:06:22.639> and

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
destruction in battlefield and

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.969 
destruction in battlefield and
battlefield<00:06:23.270> hardline<00:06:23.779> and<00:06:23.990> as<00:06:24.469> I'm<00:06:24.649> sure<00:06:24.680> you

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
battlefield hardline and as I'm sure you

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.649 
battlefield hardline and as I'm sure you
can<00:06:25.129> tell<00:06:25.339> from<00:06:25.430> this<00:06:25.610> commentary<00:06:26.060> um<00:06:26.240> I'm

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
can tell from this commentary um I'm

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.469 
can tell from this commentary um I'm
kind<00:06:27.229> of<00:06:27.439> stuck<00:06:27.709> in<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:27.919> middle<00:06:28.039> I<00:06:28.430> can<00:06:28.669> see

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
kind of stuck in the middle I can see

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.239 
kind of stuck in the middle I can see
the<00:06:29.749> point<00:06:29.930> in<00:06:30.229> having<00:06:30.259> some<00:06:30.800> buildings

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:31.249 
the point in having some buildings

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.219 
the point in having some buildings
indestructible<00:06:31.849> even<00:06:32.779> though<00:06:32.839> I<00:06:32.870> bloody<00:06:33.139> love

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
indestructible even though I bloody love

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.969 
indestructible even though I bloody love
it<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.680> love<00:06:33.770> being<00:06:34.550> able<00:06:34.759> to<00:06:35.270> wield<00:06:36.169> this<00:06:36.469> godly

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
it I love being able to wield this godly

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.709 
it I love being able to wield this godly
power<00:06:37.279> being<00:06:37.669> able<00:06:37.879> to<00:06:37.969> bring<00:06:38.120> a<00:06:38.240> building

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
power being able to bring a building

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.379 
power being able to bring a building
down<00:06:38.959> with<00:06:39.319> people<00:06:39.860> inside<00:06:40.399> it<00:06:40.699> no<00:06:40.999> matter<00:06:41.209> how

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
down with people inside it no matter how

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.730 
down with people inside it no matter how
annoying<00:06:41.749> is<00:06:42.110> if<00:06:42.259> you're<00:06:42.409> on<00:06:42.469> the<00:06:42.529> receiving

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
annoying is if you're on the receiving

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.189 
annoying is if you're on the receiving
end<00:06:43.249> of<00:06:43.459> that<00:06:43.520> by<00:06:43.849> the<00:06:43.909> way<00:06:44.149> but<00:06:44.779> on<00:06:44.899> the<00:06:45.020> same

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
end of that by the way but on the same

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.219 
end of that by the way but on the same
note<00:06:45.529> there<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.399> actually<00:06:47.360> good<00:06:47.569> reason<00:06:48.050> for

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
note there is actually good reason for

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.989 
note there is actually good reason for
having<00:06:48.349> some<00:06:48.860> buildings<00:06:49.339> that<00:06:49.520> cannot<00:06:49.939> be

00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:49.999 
having some buildings that cannot be

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.939 
having some buildings that cannot be
destroyed<00:06:50.509> for<00:06:51.080> the<00:06:51.169> funneling<00:06:51.740> and

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
destroyed for the funneling and

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.010 
destroyed for the funneling and
channeling<00:06:52.430> of<00:06:52.580> the<00:06:52.819> gameplay<00:06:53.300> and<00:06:53.539> with

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
channeling of the gameplay and with

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.519 
channeling of the gameplay and with
cityscapes<00:06:54.889> with<00:06:55.520> cityscapes<00:06:56.240> it's<00:06:56.930> so<00:06:57.229> hard

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:57.529 
cityscapes with cityscapes it's so hard

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.219 
cityscapes with cityscapes it's so hard
you<00:06:57.889> I<00:06:58.189> don't<00:06:58.339> think<00:06:58.879> with<00:06:59.300> our<00:06:59.539> current<00:06:59.959> sort

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
you I don't think with our current sort

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.679 
you I don't think with our current sort
of<00:07:00.289> technology<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.039> memory<00:07:01.430> power<00:07:01.689> available

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:02.689 
of technology and memory power available

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.060 
of technology and memory power available
in<00:07:02.899> the<00:07:03.019> game<00:07:03.229> you<00:07:03.469> couldn't<00:07:03.829> have

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
in the game you couldn't have

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.490 
in the game you couldn't have
a<00:07:04.100> map<00:07:04.400> like<00:07:04.640> saying<00:07:05.510> crossing<00:07:06.020> where<00:07:06.320> the

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
a map like saying crossing where the

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.890 
a map like saying crossing where the
whole<00:07:06.830> map<00:07:07.190> could<00:07:07.400> be<00:07:07.550> flattened<00:07:08.060> just<00:07:08.660> yet

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:08.900 
whole map could be flattened just yet

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.500 
whole map could be flattened just yet
but<00:07:09.080> I<00:07:09.140> think<00:07:09.350> it<00:07:09.500> will<00:07:09.650> happen<00:07:09.890> one<00:07:10.790> day<00:07:10.820> let

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
but I think it will happen one day let

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.760 
but I think it will happen one day let
me<00:07:11.600> know<00:07:11.720> what<00:07:11.870> your<00:07:11.990> thoughts<00:07:12.020> are<00:07:12.530> in
