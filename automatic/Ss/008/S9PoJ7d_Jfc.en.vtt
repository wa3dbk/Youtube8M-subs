00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:33.950 
and scoring um we'll just have to see
how<00:05:33.000> many<00:05:33.060> points<00:05:33.270> might<00:05:33.479> end<00:05:33.630> up<00:05:33.750> but<00:05:33.900> we

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
how many points might end up but we

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.420 
how many points might end up but we
score<00:05:34.200> up<00:05:34.320> quite<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.590> bit<00:05:34.770> with<00:05:34.889> Paul<00:05:35.099> George

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430
