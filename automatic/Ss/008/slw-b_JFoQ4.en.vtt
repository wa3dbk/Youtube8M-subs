6 plus we do get this kind of man entry

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
6 plus we do get this kind of man entry
six<00:01:08.390> digit<00:01:09.390> passcode<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.799> annoying<00:01:11.240> but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
six digit passcode which is annoying but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.219 
six digit passcode which is annoying but
nevertheless<00:01:12.799> yes<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.040> more<00:01:14.250> secure<00:01:15.229> also

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
nevertheless yes it's more secure also

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
nevertheless yes it's more secure also
we<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> wallet<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.360> here

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
we do get this wallet kind of thing here

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.530 
we do get this wallet kind of thing here
now<00:01:19.009> which<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.400> replaces<00:01:21.299> something

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
now which I think replaces something

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
now which I think replaces something
else<00:01:22.369> which<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.880> use<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> keep<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.049> your

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
else which you can use to keep all your

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.789 
else which you can use to keep all your
tickets<00:01:25.710> retail<00:01:26.460> coupons<00:01:26.970> etc<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> could

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
tickets retail coupons etc so that could

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.020 
tickets retail coupons etc so that could
be<00:01:28.950> quite<00:01:29.250> useful<00:01:31.250> obviously<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
be quite useful obviously you need to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.899 
be quite useful obviously you need to
have<00:01:33.570> something<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.079> scan<00:01:34.439> which<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:35.070> at

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
have something to scan which I don't at

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
have something to scan which I don't at
the<00:01:36.090> moment<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:37.229> other<00:01:37.590> than<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the moment I don't think other than a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.030 
the moment I don't think other than a
rubber<00:01:38.490> ducky<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.619> offend<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
rubber ducky so I don't offend when you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300 
rubber ducky so I don't offend when you
get<00:01:41.460> very<00:01:41.729> far<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.100> other<00:01:44.100> than

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
get very far with that but other than

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.859 
get very far with that but other than
that<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> look<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.630> some<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that so we can have a look at some of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.859 
that so we can have a look at some of
the<00:01:46.079> other<00:01:46.229> apps<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.659> see

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the other apps here to see if we can see

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
the other apps here to see if we can see
any<00:01:49.140> major<00:01:50.060> differences<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
any major differences and I think the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.160 
any major differences and I think the
messaging<00:01:54.930> app<00:01:55.110> looks<00:01:55.320> quite<00:01:55.680> similar<00:01:56.040> as

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
messaging app looks quite similar as

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.130 
messaging app looks quite similar as
well<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.619> calendar<00:01:59.399> app<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.530> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
well as the calendar app here and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.589 
well as the calendar app here and
weather<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.469> well<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:07.940> definitely<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.390> like

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
weather as well I definitely do like

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.830 
weather as well I definitely do like
this<00:02:10.229> weather<00:02:10.890> app<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.730> iOS<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.629> very

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
this weather app here on iOS it's very

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.150 
this weather app here on iOS it's very
nice

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
nice

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.610 
nice
in<00:02:13.280> clean<00:02:14.440> no<00:02:15.440> fluff<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:17.230> keeps<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.470> up<00:02:18.590> to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
date and like it's bigger brother we do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.570 
date and like it's bigger brother we do
also<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:25.420> revamped<00:02:26.420> kind<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.590> camera

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
also get a revamped kind of camera

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.600 
also get a revamped kind of camera
interface<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.130> shut<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.400> out<00:02:31.550> here

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
interface so we can shut that out here

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
interface so we can shut that out here
see<00:02:34.610> how<00:02:35.080> quick<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:38.800> shoots<00:02:39.910> again<00:02:40.910> any<00:02:41.300> sound

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
see how quick it shoots again any sound

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:53.500 
see how quick it shoots again any sound
that's<00:02:42.640> better<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:47.770> nice<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.100> fast<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:53.480> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
that's better that nice and fast like a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.810 
that's better that nice and fast like a
machine<00:02:54.020> gun

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
machine gun

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.880 
machine gun
so<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:55.850> think<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.360> actual<00:02:56.660> core<00:02:56.960> settings<00:02:57.260> are

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
so I think the actual core settings are

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.930 
so I think the actual core settings are
quite<00:02:58.310> similar<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:01.520> know<00:03:01.700> there's

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
quite similar here so you know there's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.510 
quite similar here so you know there's
nowhere<00:03:02.260> major<00:03:03.260> difference<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:04.100> think<00:03:04.130> in

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
nowhere major difference I think in

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.580 
nowhere major difference I think in
terms<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.120> actual<00:03:06.400> feature<00:03:07.400> set<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:09.380> can

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
terms of the actual feature set you can

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.650 
terms of the actual feature set you can
also<00:03:09.740> do<00:03:10.220> something<00:03:10.490> with<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.910> gallery<00:03:11.150> but

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
also do something with the gallery but

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.270 
also do something with the gallery but
I've<00:03:11.780> not<00:03:11.960> really<00:03:12.170> figured<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.590> out<00:03:12.710> yet<00:03:13.040> so

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
I've not really figured it out yet so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.460 
I've not really figured it out yet so
I'm<00:03:13.340> not<00:03:13.400> going<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.940> embarrass<00:03:14.330> myself<00:03:14.690> and

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
I'm not going to embarrass myself and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.760 
I'm not going to embarrass myself and
try<00:03:15.710> it<00:03:15.770> again<00:03:16.840> some<00:03:17.840> sort<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.200> flick<00:03:18.560> or

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
try it again some sort of flick or

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.310 
try it again some sort of flick or
something<00:03:19.330> maybe<00:03:20.330> I'll<00:03:20.540> figure<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.959> out<00:03:21.080> in

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
something maybe I'll figure it out in

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.140 
something maybe I'll figure it out in
another<00:03:21.560> video<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.600> look<00:03:23.750> at<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.990> maps<00:03:24.260> here

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
another video as I look at the maps here

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.070 
another video as I look at the maps here
see<00:03:26.150> if<00:03:26.240> we<00:03:26.330> can<00:03:26.480> see<00:03:26.690> any<00:03:26.840> differences<00:03:27.590> I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.760 

think<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:34.220> maps<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:34.910> iOS<00:03:35.810> platform<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.560> death

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
think the maps on iOS platform of death

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.810 
think the maps on iOS platform of death
is<00:03:37.010> definitely<00:03:37.550> come<00:03:37.850> along<00:03:38.150> quite<00:03:38.630> far

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
is definitely come along quite far

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.250 
is definitely come along quite far
remember<00:03:40.820> when<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.060> was<00:03:41.209> first<00:03:41.480> come<00:03:41.810> out<00:03:41.989> and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
remember when it was first come out and

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.340 
remember when it was first come out and
people<00:03:42.440> like<00:03:42.860> laughing<00:03:43.310> at<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.840> now<00:03:45.140> it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
people like laughing at it but now it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.449 
people like laughing at it but now it
seems<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.770> be<00:03:46.010> quite<00:03:46.239> quick<00:03:47.239> here<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:49.160> if<00:03:49.310> I

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
seems to be quite quick here and if I

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.540 
seems to be quite quick here and if I
wanted<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.880> go<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.480> somewhere<00:03:51.110> like<00:03:51.520> let<00:03:52.520> us

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
wanted to go to somewhere like let us

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:02.600 
wanted to go to somewhere like let us
say<00:03:53.650> Island

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.420 

he<00:04:03.610> guess<00:04:03.849> it<00:04:04.120> does<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.420> job<00:04:04.690> basically<00:04:08.430> she's

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
he guess it does the job basically she's

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.070 
he guess it does the job basically she's
quite<00:04:09.760> nice<00:04:11.459> also<00:04:12.459> other<00:04:12.700> than<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:13.180> as<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
quite nice also other than that as I

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:26.550 
quite nice also other than that as I
look<00:04:14.110> at<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:15.540> browser<00:04:16.540> here<00:04:24.630> so<00:04:25.630> we<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.320> have

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
look at the browser here so we do have

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.719 
look at the browser here so we do have
Safari<00:04:27.460> here<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:29.710> definitely<00:04:29.919> like<00:04:30.250> this

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
Safari here and I definitely like this

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:39.650 
Safari here and I definitely like this
kind<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.270> UI<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.690> Safari<00:04:32.440> users<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:39.100> really

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
kind of UI that Safari users it's really

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.879 
kind of UI that Safari users it's really
pretty<00:04:40.660> cool<00:04:41.080> if<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.320> ask<00:04:41.530> me<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:43.680> other<00:04:44.680> than

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
pretty cool if you ask me and other than

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.170 
pretty cool if you ask me and other than
that<00:04:45.010> we<00:04:45.610> do<00:04:46.030> have<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.419> health<00:04:46.660> app<00:04:46.960> still<00:04:48.180> so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
that we do have the health app still so

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.879 
that we do have the health app still so
it<00:04:49.510> doesn't<00:04:49.780> alike<00:04:49.960> with<00:04:50.110> as<00:04:50.320> many<00:04:50.440> changes

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
it doesn't alike with as many changes

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.260 
it doesn't alike with as many changes
here<00:04:51.550> on<00:04:52.210> this<00:04:52.539> one<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:54.580> definitely<00:04:55.120> get

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
here on this one you definitely get

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.060 
here on this one you definitely get
quite<00:04:55.660> a<00:04:55.690> lot<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:55.990> stuff<00:04:56.289> here<00:04:56.590> though

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
quite a lot of stuff here though

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.159 
quite a lot of stuff here though
which<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:57.729> quite<00:04:58.030> good<00:04:58.949> you<00:04:59.949> also<00:05:00.160> get<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
which is quite good you also get the

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.480 
which is quite good you also get the
multitasking<00:05:02.169> as<00:05:02.410> well<00:05:02.680> same<00:05:03.039> as<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.370> iPhone

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
multitasking as well same as the iPhone

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.750 
multitasking as well same as the iPhone
6<00:05:03.970> plus<00:05:04.289> which<00:05:05.289> looks<00:05:05.889> a<00:05:06.010> little<00:05:06.130> bit<00:05:06.310> slicker

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
6 plus which looks a little bit slicker

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.940 
6 plus which looks a little bit slicker
here<00:05:07.300> than<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.690> iPhone<00:05:08.050> 6<00:05:08.289> plus<00:05:08.470> which<00:05:08.770> is<00:05:08.800> a

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
here than the iPhone 6 plus which is a

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.600 
here than the iPhone 6 plus which is a
bit<00:05:09.160> laggy<00:05:10.229> so<00:05:11.229> that's<00:05:11.680> pretty<00:05:12.039> cool<00:05:12.310> if<00:05:12.490> you

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
bit laggy so that's pretty cool if you

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.350 
bit laggy so that's pretty cool if you
ask<00:05:12.669> me<00:05:14.310> also<00:05:15.310> because<00:05:15.849> the<00:05:15.970> device<00:05:16.330> is

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
ask me also because the device is

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.710 
ask me also because the device is
smaller<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.289> does<00:05:17.500> feel<00:05:17.880> much<00:05:18.880> easier<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.510> do

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
smaller it does feel much easier to do

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.740 
smaller it does feel much easier to do
as<00:05:20.020> well<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:21.389> that's<00:05:22.389> quite<00:05:22.810> good<00:05:23.139> and<00:05:24.750> other

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
as well so that's quite good and other

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.000 
as well so that's quite good and other
than<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.289> we<00:05:27.039> are<00:05:27.070> also<00:05:27.990> as<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.320> look<00:05:29.590> at<00:05:29.740> the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
than that we are also as I look at the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.719 
than that we are also as I look at the
actual<00:05:30.990> software<00:05:32.729> kind<00:05:33.729> of<00:05:34.020> statistics<00:05:35.020> here

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
actual software kind of statistics here

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.409 
actual software kind of statistics here
if<00:05:36.729> I<00:05:36.910> can<00:05:37.120> get<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.630> them<00:05:38.789> so<00:05:39.789> trouble<00:05:40.150> when<00:05:40.300> you

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
if I can get to them so trouble when you

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.510 
if I can get to them so trouble when you
are<00:05:40.539> so<00:05:40.810> many<00:05:40.990> different<00:05:41.320> platforms<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.280> can

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
are so many different platforms it can

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.270 
are so many different platforms it can
get<00:05:43.410> quite<00:05:44.410> interesting<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:46.979> looks<00:05:47.979> like

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
get quite interesting so looks like

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:57.540 
get quite interesting so looks like
where<00:05:49.270> are<00:05:49.419> we<00:05:49.800> down<00:05:50.800> here<00:05:55.770> where<00:05:56.770> is<00:05:56.949> it<00:05:57.250> there

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
where are we down here where is it there

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.460 
where are we down here where is it there
is<00:05:57.760> version<00:05:58.630> 9<00:05:58.979> that's<00:05:59.979> what<00:06:00.250> I<00:06:00.280> needed<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.880> see

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
is version 9 that's what I needed to see

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.020 
is version 9 that's what I needed to see
so<00:06:02.470> I<00:06:02.500> wasn't<00:06:02.830> installing<00:06:03.639> something<00:06:03.910> random

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
so I wasn't installing something random

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.649 
so I wasn't installing something random
carplay<00:06:07.030> was<00:06:07.300> this<00:06:10.050> interesting<00:06:12.150> so<00:06:13.150> I<00:06:13.539> think

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
carplay was this interesting so I think

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.620 
carplay was this interesting so I think
really<00:06:14.560> it's<00:06:15.190> quite<00:06:15.760> a<00:06:15.880> nice

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
really it's quite a nice

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.430 
really it's quite a nice

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
difference in terms of the

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.020 
difference in terms of the
functionalities<00:06:23.680> if<00:06:24.160> were<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.400> be<00:06:24.640> honest

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
functionalities if were to be honest

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.020 
functionalities if were to be honest
kind<00:06:25.990> of<00:06:26.080> like<00:06:26.260> the<00:06:26.470> junk<00:06:26.770> from<00:06:27.930> like<00:06:28.930> Android

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030

jellybean - well in fact like the jump
from<00:06:35.230> ICS<00:06:36.040> to<00:06:36.340> Android<00:06:36.850> jellybean<00:06:37.440> like<00:06:38.440> I

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
from ICS to Android jellybean like I

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.350 
from ICS to Android jellybean like I
think<00:06:39.040> there<00:06:39.220> wasn't<00:06:39.370> too<00:06:39.700> much<00:06:39.880> in<00:06:40.090> the<00:06:40.210> way

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
think there wasn't too much in the way

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.500 
think there wasn't too much in the way
of<00:06:40.510> differences<00:06:41.400> but<00:06:42.400> the<00:06:42.580> underlying<00:06:42.880> kind

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
of differences but the underlying kind

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:49.200 
of differences but the underlying kind
of<00:06:43.720> stuff<00:06:44.080> was<00:06:44.890> made<00:06:45.130> better<00:06:46.020> so<00:06:47.020> I<00:06:48.210> think

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
of stuff was made better so I think

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.760 
of stuff was made better so I think
