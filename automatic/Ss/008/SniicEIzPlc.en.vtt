00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.670
Speaker 1: Broadway, I'm trying to work on
my handle here.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.670
Alright.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm from the expert level here.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.350
Do some fancy tricks, you know what I'm saying.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.350
Come down the court . . .

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.530
Speaker 2: What do you we say, Swoop?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
Speaker 1: What?

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.300
Speaker 2: Before you move on to the expert
level, what do we have to do first?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.000
Speaker 1: I gotta master the fundamentals.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I got you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Speaker 2: Master the fundamentals.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Speaker 1: Yes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Speaker 2: This is fun stuff you can try at
home.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.289
Speaker 2: But you want to first become a
good ball handler and practice the right technique

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.289
. . .

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.289
Speaker 1: OK.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:33.289
Speaker 2: . . . like we talked about before.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.289
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.289
Speaker 2: So you want to keep that ball below
your knee.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.289
Speaker 1: Right.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.289
Speaker 2: You want to keep your head up.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.289
Speaker 1: Head up.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.540
Speaker 2: And you want to make sure you control
the basketball.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.540
Speaker 1: Nice, nice.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.980
Speaker 2: So I brought in an expert.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.980
Speaker 1: Really?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.980
He's gonna teach me some tricks?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.910
Speaker 2: He can teach you some tricks, but
as long as you know . . .

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.910
Speaker 1: Right.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.470
Speaker 2: . . . you gotta do the fundamentals
first.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.470
Speaker 1: OK.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.470
I got you.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.470
Speaker 2: We got a deal?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.470
Speaker 1: We got a deal.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.470
Speaker 2: Alright.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.470
Speaker 1: Hey, what's the first trick I'm
gonna learn today?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.470
Speaker 2: You're going to do a little knee
bounce.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.830
Speaker 1: Oh I already know how to do a knee
bounce, yo.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.510
I don't know how to do a knee
bounce.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.300
Speaker 2: You just said you knew.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.100
Speaker 1: But I thought I had knew because
I have seen it in a movie called 'White Men

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.670
Can't Jump,' but I don't know how to do it.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.670
Speaker 2: No?

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.670
Speaker 1: No.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.400
Speaker 2: So King Arthur's gonna show us
a knee bounce.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Speaker 1: Oh.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
Speaker 2: See that?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.110
Speaker 1: Oh, he's, like, dribbling it off
his knee.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510
Speaker 2: Yeah.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.840
Speaker 1: That's nice, yo.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.141
Look how fly that look.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:19.141
He look fancy.

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.141
C: Fancy, huh?

00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:21.141
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:22.141

00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.141
OK.

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.141
So I just bounce it on my knee?

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:28.141
Speaker 2: Yeah.

00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:29.141
Speaker 1: Ok.

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:30.141
Oh.

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:31.141
Speaker 2: Oh.

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.141
Speaker 1: So when do I use this?

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:33.170
When I'm in the park?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.170

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.240

Speaker 2: They're gonna steal it from you.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
Speaker 1: Let's watch them do that.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.020
Speaker 2: No.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.020
Speaker 1: When do I do these, then?

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
Speaker 2: Just practice it at home.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.020

Speaker 2: No.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.020
You gotta be really advanced to pull that
off in a game.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.020
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.020

Speaker 1: OK.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.020
I'll call you.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.020

Speaker 1: Right.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.069
Speaker 2: . . . teaching the people at home
how to bounce that ball off your knee.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.069
Speaker 1: Right.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.959
Speaker 2: Again, mastering the fundamentals
first, then moving to expert level with the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.989
King.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.940
Bouncing the ball right off your knee.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.380
Lift that knee up.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.810
Throw the ball right under there.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.430
Come right back to you.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.639
There you have it.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.040
Knee bounce with the Wizards.
