this new shoot this one the one in the
back<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.899> shoot<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> growing<00:01:02.160> another

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
back and this shoot is growing another

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789 
back and this shoot is growing another
one<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> vegetative

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
one here so there's a lot of vegetative

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.580 
one here so there's a lot of vegetative
growth<00:01:05.010> no<00:01:05.670> flower<00:01:05.880> spikes<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.540> far<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.380> look

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

at this these two bulbs have flower
spikes<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:12.150> flower<00:01:12.390> spike<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
managed to save it The Orchid itself
doesn't<00:01:23.700> look<00:01:23.880> necessarily<00:01:24.420> good

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
doesn't look necessarily good

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.950

it was super dehydrated and I did my

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
it was super dehydrated and I did my
best<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.409> keep<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> moist<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> humid<00:01:29.610> but

still I got a few wrinkle beads this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.210 
still I got a few wrinkle beads this
growth<00:01:32.820> looks<00:01:33.210> much<00:01:33.479> better<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.770> reason

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

time the new growths will look normal

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
time the new growths will look normal
but<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> flower<00:01:42.060> spikes<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> good<00:01:42.960> sign

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
not happy about that maybe I just

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
not happy about that maybe I just
dehydrated<00:03:12.180> sometimes<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.050> it's<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.319> mass

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590

there's no ventilation anyway I don't

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.390 
there's no ventilation anyway I don't
like<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.269> whole<00:03:18.390> setup<00:03:18.709> I'm<00:03:19.709> more<00:03:19.920> acquainted

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400

I'll<00:03:22.140> do<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.349> mixture<00:03:22.769> more<00:03:23.459> water<00:03:23.700> retentive

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
sure why they managed to come out so

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.490 
sure why they managed to come out so
wrinkly<00:05:13.370> but<00:05:13.639> I'll<00:05:13.880> try<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.210> fix<00:05:14.570> that

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
wrinkly but I'll try to fix that

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.920 
wrinkly but I'll try to fix that
other<00:05:15.949> than<00:05:16.190> that<00:05:16.250> suitable<00:05:16.699> is<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.360> plump<00:05:17.690> the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
other than that suitable is so plump the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.900 
other than that suitable is so plump the
one<00:05:18.080> from<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.410> back<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:18.979> right<00:05:19.160> kid<00:05:19.340> they

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
one from the back so this right kid they

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.750 
one from the back so this right kid they
did<00:05:20.360> produce<00:05:20.539> some<00:05:20.720> roots<00:05:21.169> but<00:05:22.039> I<00:05:22.220> just<00:05:22.580> don't

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
did produce some roots but I just don't

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.210 
did produce some roots but I just don't
like<00:05:22.910> how<00:05:23.570> they<00:05:23.900> develop<00:05:24.380> they<00:05:24.560> could<00:05:24.919> be<00:05:25.039> much

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
like how they develop they could be much

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.550 
like how they develop they could be much
better<00:05:25.400> than<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.820> but<00:05:26.300> anyway<00:05:26.599> yeah<00:05:27.020> let's

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
one that I purchased from Ikea last

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.050 
one that I purchased from Ikea last
summer<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.470> producing<00:05:40.039> some<00:05:40.280> new<00:05:40.400> growths<00:05:40.760> a

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
summer it's producing some new growths a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.719 
summer it's producing some new growths a
few<00:05:41.570> pleated<00:05:42.020> leaves<00:05:42.289> didn't<00:05:43.250> have<00:05:43.370> too<00:05:43.550> many

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
few pleated leaves didn't have too many

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.000 
few pleated leaves didn't have too many
roots<00:05:44.000> starting<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.139> grow<00:05:45.349> quite<00:05:45.620> a<00:05:45.680> lot<00:05:45.889> of

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
roots starting to grow quite a lot of

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.920 
roots starting to grow quite a lot of
roots<00:05:46.250> right<00:05:46.430> now<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:46.880> I'm<00:05:47.090> hoping<00:05:47.479> she'll<00:05:47.720> get

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
roots right now so I'm hoping she'll get

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.430 
roots right now so I'm hoping she'll get
better<00:05:48.199> I<00:05:49.070> find<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.789> really<00:05:49.940> hard<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.539> keep<00:05:51.050> the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
better I find it really hard to keep the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.070 
better I find it really hard to keep the

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
Multani abscess leaves super straight

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.020 
Multani abscess leaves super straight
for<00:05:54.710> some<00:05:54.860> reason<00:05:55.190> some<00:05:55.400> of<00:05:55.520> them<00:05:55.699> grow

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
for some reason some of them grow

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.439 
for some reason some of them grow
straight<00:05:56.419> some<00:05:56.720> of<00:05:56.840> them<00:05:56.990> don't<00:05:58.120> except<00:05:59.120> for

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
straight some of them don't except for

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.950 
straight some of them don't except for
two<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.930> them<00:06:00.139> none<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.889> them<00:06:01.099> have<00:06:01.430> really

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
two of them none of them have really

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.570 
two of them none of them have really
really<00:06:02.960> good<00:06:03.260> root<00:06:03.620> system<00:06:03.650> so<00:06:04.099> probably

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
really good root system so probably

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.210 
really good root system so probably
that's<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:05.030> case<00:06:05.240> that's<00:06:05.870> anyway<00:06:06.409> this<00:06:06.979> is

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
that's the case that's anyway this is
