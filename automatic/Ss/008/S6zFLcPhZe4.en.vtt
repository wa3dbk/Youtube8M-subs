back to red so we can play around with

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.230 
back to red so we can play around with
different<00:03:13.560> color<00:03:13.950> schemes<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.000> kind

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
different color schemes to get the kind

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.670 
different color schemes to get the kind

of surfboard that we're really
interested<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.300> that's<00:03:18.420> one<00:03:18.690> use<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
interested in so that's one use of the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.800 
interested in so that's one use of the
smart<00:03:19.380> brush<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:20.070> turn<00:03:20.580> things<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.540> different

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
smart brush to turn things a different

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.170 
smart brush to turn things a different
color<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.370> smart<00:03:23.610> brush<00:03:23.850> we<00:03:24.030> also

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
color but in the smart brush we also

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.780 
color but in the smart brush we also
have<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.600> sort<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.350> more<00:03:25.560> powerful<00:03:25.950> capability

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
have a sort of more powerful capability

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.870 
have a sort of more powerful capability
where<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.350> pick<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> different<00:03:29.160> category<00:03:29.340> so

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
where if I pick a different category so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.670 
where if I pick a different category so
instead<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.330> color

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
instead of color

maybe<00:03:35.340> blue<00:03:35.880> skies<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:37.260> particular<00:03:37.530> picture

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
maybe blue skies this particular picture

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.949 
maybe blue skies this particular picture
doesn't<00:03:38.220> have<00:03:38.550> any<00:03:38.760> sky<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:39.810> this

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
doesn't have any sky in it but this

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.600 
doesn't have any sky in it but this
water<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> background<00:03:41.040> might<00:03:41.220> look<00:03:41.490> a

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
water in the background might look a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.420 
water in the background might look a
little<00:03:41.760> better<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:43.170> was<00:03:43.290> blue<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.310> I'm

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
little better if it was blue so I'm

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.040 
little better if it was blue so I'm
going<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.640> go<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> nature<00:03:45.300> category<00:03:45.810> I'm

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
going to select this one right here

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.449 
going to select this one right here
which<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.780> make<00:03:49.020> dull<00:03:49.410> skies<00:03:49.739> blue<00:03:50.040> works
