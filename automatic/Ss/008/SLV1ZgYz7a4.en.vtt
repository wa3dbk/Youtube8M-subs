00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
because this pedal um enables me to like

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.150 
because this pedal um enables me to like
almost<00:00:15.480> whatever<00:00:15.750> amp<00:00:16.109> anyway<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.890> plugging

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
almost whatever amp anyway I'm plugging

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.880 
almost whatever amp anyway I'm plugging
into<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.970> sort<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.300> get<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.750> sound<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.500> after

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
into I can sort of get my sound in after

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.450 
into I can sort of get my sound in after
and<00:00:20.070> work<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.630> also<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
and work with it and also you can it

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.849 
and work with it and also you can it
warms<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:24.740> most<00:00:25.740> stamps<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:27.859> it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
warms up most stamps and really it

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.669 
warms up most stamps and really it
doesn't<00:00:29.099> change<00:00:29.490> their<00:00:29.970> tone<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.900> sin<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.439> much

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
doesn't change their tone so sin as much

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.580 
doesn't change their tone so sin as much
as<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.040> well<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:34.020> there's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> lot

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
as it well it can because there's a lot

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
as it well it can because there's a lot
of<00:00:34.890> variance<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> mean<00:00:36.239> obviously

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
of variance you know I mean obviously

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.959 
of variance you know I mean obviously
there's<00:00:36.870> tone<00:00:37.230> controls<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> lot

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
there's tone controls and there's a lot

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.610 
there's tone controls and there's a lot
of<00:00:39.030> different<00:00:39.239> things<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.050> know<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.500> do

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
of different things you know you can do

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
of different things you know you can do
like<00:00:40.800> close<00:00:41.100> speaker<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.760> off<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.059> speaker

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
like close speaker and off the speaker

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.639 
like close speaker and off the speaker
and<00:00:42.510> all<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:42.899> different<00:00:43.110> things<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and all these different things that you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
and all these different things that you
can<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.700> B<00:00:44.820> b-plus<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
can do with the B b-plus but with the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
can do with the B b-plus but with the
thing<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.760> for

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
thing that it really really can do for

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.369 
thing that it really really can do for
you<00:00:48.149> though<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.870> sort<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:51.379> mitigate

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you though is it can sort of mitigate

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.810 
you though is it can sort of mitigate
some<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> evils<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> bad<00:00:54.870> amp<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.949> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
some of the evils of a bad amp and so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
some of the evils of a bad amp and so
that's<00:00:57.000> why<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> always<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.859> that's

that's why I always and you know that's
not<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> main<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> pedal<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.719> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
not the main use for the pedal but it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
not the main use for the pedal but it's
all<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.829> use<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.030> know

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120

totally fair because i'm using my amp

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.420 
totally fair because i'm using my amp
but<00:01:19.049> we're<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.259> plugging<00:01:19.740> straight<00:01:20.070> into<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
but we're just plugging straight into it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.950 
but we're just plugging straight into it
there's<00:01:20.759> no<00:01:20.880> i'm<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.180> using<00:01:21.360> any<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
so so now that's just a basic tone right

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.740 
so so now that's just a basic tone right
from<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.719> amp<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.469> went<00:01:30.770> up

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
don't want to you still want to hear

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.169 
don't want to you still want to hear
like<00:02:05.869> be<00:02:06.320> able<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.649> hear<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> pretty<00:02:07.190> cord<00:02:07.610> you

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
like be able to hear a pretty cord you

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.449 
like be able to hear a pretty cord you
know<00:02:08.360> then<00:02:09.350> i<00:02:09.530> wouldn't<00:02:09.860> turn<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.250> gain<00:02:10.429> up

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
know then i wouldn't turn the gain up

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.130 
know then i wouldn't turn the gain up
too<00:02:10.789> much<00:02:11.000> but

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.780 

you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.759 
you
and<00:02:19.329> it's<00:02:19.659> just<00:02:19.810> all<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> say<00:02:20.590> it

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
and it's just all like I say it

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.580 
and it's just all like I say it
automatically<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.939> makes<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.329> amp<00:02:22.590> just

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
automatically just makes the amp just

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.580 
automatically just makes the amp just
open<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.250> bit<00:02:24.730> check<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.150> out<00:02:25.739> so<00:02:26.739> listen

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.340 

No

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.680 

just<00:02:38.280> has<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> little<00:02:38.730> bit<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.000> Sparkle<00:02:39.600> and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
just has a little bit more Sparkle and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:51.440 
just has a little bit more Sparkle and
some<00:02:39.870> more<00:02:39.960> harmonics<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.800> stuff<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:51.090> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
some more harmonics and stuff up and it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.660 
some more harmonics and stuff up and it
really<00:02:51.660> reacts<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.470> similar<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> way

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
really reacts very similar to the way

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.780 
really reacts very similar to the way
that<00:02:53.940> uh<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:54.990> an<00:02:55.530> amp<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.280> kind<00:02:56.670> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that uh like a an amp that's kind of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.840 
that uh like a an amp that's kind of
turned<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.240> would<00:02:57.630> act<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.140> your<00:02:58.740> if<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.430> lower

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
turned up would act if your if you lower

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.670 
turned up would act if your if you lower
the<00:03:00.060> volume<00:03:00.330> control<00:03:00.690> pedal<00:03:00.990> on<00:03:01.110> your<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.320> mean

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680

still use this pedal to give a little
bit<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.610> know<00:04:52.639> to<00:04:52.789> open<00:04:53.210> up<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.449> sound<00:04:53.630> a

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
bit you know to open up the sound a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.810 
bit you know to open up the sound a
little<00:04:54.020> bit<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:54.440> i<00:04:54.470> really<00:04:54.740> loved<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.250> BB<00:04:55.580> for

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
little bit so i really loved a BB for
