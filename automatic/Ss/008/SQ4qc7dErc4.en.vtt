00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 their bravo the title and the record of 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 France I wanted to swim fast I had not 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.510
 Too much time in the lead even though 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.710
 necessarily again from France was my 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 scope especially with what I had 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.549
 did this morning I did not see my age and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.690
 like I wanted tonight so I think 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.619
 that I can go a little more 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.240
 quickly to the european championships 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.000
 so here you have to swim with your 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.220
 little brother right after you he is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 still pretty monstrous but 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.760
 monstrous but I think he's not 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 he's not happy about his race could 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 break a record tonight and I think 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.630
 it will be for soon so lighthouses 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.980
 in all the strokes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.059
 I think everyone who tells him 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 that they have to go 200 4 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180
 but must train too much for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 him so 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 so here we will see in a few years 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
 I think he can get close to fels 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.719
 finally you put your record of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 france of four hundredths irak the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.469
 France's record of 400 t wanted 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 show that you are the big sister 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 I'm the big sister but I have 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.190
 no longer need him who needs me 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.980
 and it's a pleasure to see you win 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.540
 today 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.399
 to know who is still under foot 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.600
 pleasure prices more generally on 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.950
 these championships of france here angers 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.839
 but I took a lot of fun 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.170
 especially with the club with its 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.210
 swimmers 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.010
 it is a moment that I shared 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.470
 moments like that since dunkirk 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.540
 last year and it's a real treat 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.729
 it's a shared feeling it's true 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.220
 that my goal was to beat his 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.720
 french record i knew the record 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.180
 from Europe was not very far either 26 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.770
 this is my reach so I think a 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.880
 little disappointed especially for for four 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.710
 hundredths but hey it's like that and I 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840
 know that I still have what we can be 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.399
 a little more prepared behind so I 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 think it's going to go I hope it's 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.259
 true I am quite versatile but I have 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.670
 not yet explored the 100 m the 200 m 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.770
 so I stay on small distances 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.060
 in short course sprint is true that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.640
 the template is made for many 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.810
 so that's a bit for that I think 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.369
 people say that but then I'm going 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.110
 wait to be in the big pool 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.700
 is to have won titles in big 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.050
 basin to say that lucky 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.960
 no I think he is 22 years old we are 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.850
 satiated it's complicated no I still 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.119
 the time before me and the desire in more 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.479
 so here I have I think of beautiful 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.479
 years before me 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.410
 here I like the pool I hurt 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.310
 vincent after we get to the 3rd day to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.410
 every time I blame a little 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.960
 little always the second part of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.300
 competition so tomorrow I'm doing 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.400
 a stalemate on a trial and I loose 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.959
 a little bit about a 50 pap history 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.970
 have fun and then start a 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.970
 little bit it's celebrated for euros
