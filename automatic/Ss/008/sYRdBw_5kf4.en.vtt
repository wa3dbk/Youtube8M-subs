00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
always you know had this doubt in the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.560 
always you know had this doubt in the
back<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.180> head<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:35.640> do<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> hybrid<00:02:36.300> squad

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
back of my head is to do a hybrid squad

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.420 
back of my head is to do a hybrid squad
now<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> think<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.620> would<00:02:37.740> make<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.070> road<00:02:38.280> to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
now I think I would make this road to

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.890 
now I think I would make this road to
glory<00:02:38.520> or<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.210> starting<00:02:39.600> from<00:02:39.720> scratch

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
glory or the starting from scratch

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.560 
glory or the starting from scratch
series<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.470> whole<00:02:41.310> lot<00:02:41.610> more<00:02:41.820> interesting<00:02:42.210> is

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
series a whole lot more interesting is

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.140 
series a whole lot more interesting is
if<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.870> did<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.680> know<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> hybrid<00:02:44.250> side<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:45.030> Mike

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
if I did you know a hybrid side but Mike

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.820 
if I did you know a hybrid side but Mike
what<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.600> thing<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.230> building<00:02:46.470> up<00:02:46.740> a

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
what the thing is when building up a

what the thing is when building up a
hybrid<00:02:47.220> squad<00:02:47.460> like<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.530> ya<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:50.010> just

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
hybrid squad like this and ya know just

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.310 
hybrid squad like this and ya know just
building<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.180> hybrid<00:02:51.510> squad<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.200> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
building up a hybrid squad you have to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.770 
building up a hybrid squad you have to
go<00:02:52.410> through<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.710> patch<00:02:52.920> where<00:02:53.640> your<00:02:54.270> chemistry

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
go through a patch where your chemistry

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.410 
go through a patch where your chemistry
is<00:02:54.990> going<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.560> be<00:02:55.680> pretty<00:02:55.980> poor<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.270> know

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
is going to be pretty poor and you know

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.910 
is going to be pretty poor and you know
you're<00:02:57.780> not<00:02:57.900> going<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.170> get<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.800> best

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
you're not going to get the best

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.270 
you're not going to get the best
chemistry<00:02:59.430> but<00:03:00.110> maybe<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.200> should<00:03:01.590> do<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:02.010> if

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
chemistry but maybe I should do it so if

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.000 
chemistry but maybe I should do it so if
you<00:03:02.580> guys<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.150> guys<00:03:03.210> have<00:03:03.540> any<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.980> know

that<00:05:43.710> I'm<00:05:43.919> going<00:05:44.099> to<00:05:44.190> revolve<00:05:44.700> an<00:05:44.910> entire<00:05:45.330> team

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
that I'm going to revolve an entire team

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.540 
that I'm going to revolve an entire team
around<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.530> think<00:05:46.740> that<00:05:46.889> still<00:05:47.190> keeps<00:05:47.430> the

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
around and I think that still keeps the

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.360 
around and I think that still keeps the
road<00:05:47.849> to<00:05:48.320> road<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.470> glory<00:05:49.590> aspect<00:05:49.889> of<00:05:50.250> it
