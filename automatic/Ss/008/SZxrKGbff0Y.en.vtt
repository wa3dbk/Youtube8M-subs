smaller box but it's the pretty much the
exact<00:00:41.670> same<00:00:41.760> game<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:42.930> through<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> desert

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
exact same game now through the desert

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
exact same game now through the desert
is<00:00:44.010> everything<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.820> about<00:00:45.030> games

is everything I don't like about games
in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> fact<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> theme<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.590> fake

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
in the fact that the theme is so fake

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
in the fact that the theme is so fake
it's<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:48.059> camels<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.690> caravans<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it's about camels and caravans and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's about camels and caravans and
whatever<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.460> abstract<00:00:51.030> strategy<00:00:51.210> game

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
whatever it's an abstract strategy game

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.850 
whatever it's an abstract strategy game
and<00:00:52.039> it<00:00:53.039> looks<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.309> candy<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.440> doesn't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and it looks like candy but that doesn't

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
and it looks like candy but that doesn't
mean<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> bad<00:00:56.219> game<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.879> fact<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
mean it's a bad game in fact it's a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:18.320 
mean it's a bad game in fact it's a
really<00:00:57.620> really<00:00:58.620> good<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.160> let<00:00:59.820> me<00:00:59.940> show<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.210 

so<00:01:19.330> here's<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.750> board<00:01:19.990> now<00:01:20.170> this<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.500> random

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
so here's the board now this is a random

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.100 
so here's the board now this is a random
setup<00:01:21.640> you'll<00:01:22.060> start<00:01:22.299> with<00:01:22.360> some<00:01:22.540> palm<00:01:22.780> trees

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
setup you'll start with some palm trees

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.740 
setup you'll start with some palm trees
on<00:01:24.040> some<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.760> these<00:01:24.820> spaces<00:01:25.119> that<00:01:25.360> have<00:01:25.510> palms

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
on some of these spaces that have palms

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.480 
on some of these spaces that have palms
on<00:01:26.140> them<00:01:26.350> you're<00:01:26.890> only<00:01:27.010> going<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.220> put<00:01:27.369> out

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
on them you're only going to put out

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.180 
on them you're only going to put out
five<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.880> them<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.740> can<00:01:29.950> have<00:01:30.040> them

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
five of them and so you can have them

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.770 
five of them and so you can have them
random<00:01:30.610> each<00:01:30.729> time<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.330> then<00:01:31.570> you're<00:01:31.690> going

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
random each time and then you're going

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.969 
random each time and then you're going
to<00:01:31.840> put<00:01:31.960> out<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.080> bunch<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.320> watering<00:01:32.680> holes

little cool color camels and players are

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.920 
little cool color camels and players are
at<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.550> beginning<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> game<00:02:16.269> are<00:02:16.750> gonna

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
at the beginning of the game are gonna

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.900 
at the beginning of the game are gonna
start<00:02:17.230> by<00:02:17.380> placing<00:02:17.680> these<00:02:18.069> around<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.640> board

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
start by placing these around the board

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.220 
start by placing these around the board
in<00:02:19.030> different<00:02:19.330> spots<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.780> can't<00:02:19.959> put<00:02:20.140> them

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
in different spots you can't put them

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.690 
in different spots you can't put them
next<00:02:20.440> other<00:02:20.709> camels<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.280> can't<00:02:21.489> put<00:02:21.640> them

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
next other camels and you can't put them

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.350 
next other camels and you can't put them
next<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.709> palm<00:02:23.709> tree<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.940> can<00:02:25.150> put<00:02:25.269> them

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
next to a palm tree but you can put them

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.830 
next to a palm tree but you can put them
in<00:02:25.420> different<00:02:25.540> areas<00:02:25.780> over<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.350> board<00:02:26.560> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
in different areas over the board and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.060 
in different areas over the board and
that's<00:02:28.840> kind<00:02:29.079> of<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.200> way<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.410> start<00:02:29.799> up<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
that's kind of the way you start up and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.020 
that's kind of the way you start up and
just<00:02:30.160> if<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.459> see<00:02:30.610> there's<00:02:30.760> like<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.910> little

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
just if you see there's like a little

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.460 
just if you see there's like a little
jagged<00:02:31.299> line<00:02:31.570> there<00:02:31.780> cuz<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.140> board<00:02:32.350> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
jagged line there cuz the board is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.210 
jagged line there cuz the board is
smaller<00:02:32.799> for<00:02:33.630> fewer<00:02:34.630> players<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:36.010> once

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
smaller for fewer players and then once

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.710 
smaller for fewer players and then once
all<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.519> camels<00:02:36.730> involve<00:02:37.239> different<00:02:37.420> players

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
all the camels involve different players

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.940 
all the camels involve different players
are<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.140> board<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.500> I'll<00:02:38.560> put<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.739> few

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
are all the board and I'll put a few

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.640 
are all the board and I'll put a few
more<00:02:39.160> out<00:02:39.340> even<00:02:40.090> though<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.170> completely

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
more out even though this is completely

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.289 
more out even though this is completely
just<00:02:41.829> random<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.519> be<00:02:42.700> thinking<00:02:43.060> about<00:02:43.180> a

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
just random I would be thinking about a

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.140 
just random I would be thinking about a
little<00:02:43.450> bit<00:02:43.660> more<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.380> were<00:02:44.530> playing<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.910> on

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
little bit more if I were playing but on

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.860 
little bit more if I were playing but on
my<00:02:46.630> turn<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.950> very<00:02:48.250> simple<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.820> take<00:02:49.600> two

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.810 
my turn it's very simple I take two
camels<00:02:50.170> from<00:02:50.799> these<00:02:50.950> piles<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.430> camels<00:02:51.730> over

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
camels from these piles of camels over

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.140 
camels from these piles of camels over

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
there because I get this chip now and I

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.900 
there because I get this chip now and I
put<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.070> front<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.280> me<00:03:12.370> that's<00:03:12.519> worth<00:03:12.670> one

the<00:03:54.030> last<00:03:54.209> thing<00:03:54.420> I'm<00:03:54.480> gonna<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.900> I'm<00:03:54.959> gonna

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
the last thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.610 
try to cut off the whole section of the
board<00:03:56.880> if<00:03:57.000> possible<00:03:57.569> you'll<00:03:58.230> notice<00:03:58.530> that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
board if possible you'll notice that

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500 
board if possible you'll notice that
there<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.459> rounded<00:03:59.849> area<00:04:00.030> here

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
there is a little rounded area here

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.240 
there is a little rounded area here
which<00:04:00.989> acts<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.440> an<00:04:01.530> edge<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.860> board<00:04:02.069> but

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
which acts as an edge of the board but

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.940 
which acts as an edge of the board but
let's<00:04:02.430> say<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.640> had<00:04:02.910> my<00:04:03.060> camels<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.989> at

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
let's say I had my camels like this at

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.030 
let's say I had my camels like this at
the<00:04:05.160> end<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.549> game<00:04:06.530> I've<00:04:07.530> been<00:04:07.769> closed

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the end of the game I've been closed

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.580 
the end of the game I've been closed
this<00:04:08.190> whole<00:04:08.459> area<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:10.080> would<00:04:10.260> get<00:04:10.410> one

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
this whole area here and I would get one

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.960 
this whole area here and I would get one
point<00:04:10.860> for<00:04:11.010> each<00:04:11.040> spot<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.670> have<00:04:11.850> been

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
point for each spot that I have been

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.900 
point for each spot that I have been
closed<00:04:12.440> now<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:13.739> never<00:04:13.860> put<00:04:14.160> your<00:04:14.400> camel

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
closed now you can never put your camel

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.960 
closed now you can never put your camel
next<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.019> same<00:04:16.290> color<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.919> someone<00:04:17.669> else's

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
next to the same color of someone else's

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.050 
next to the same color of someone else's
camel<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.930> if<00:04:19.200> for<00:04:19.769> example<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.370> green<00:04:20.549> camels

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
camel so if for example the green camels

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.110 
camel so if for example the green camels
are<00:04:21.600> over<00:04:21.870> here<00:04:22.220> no<00:04:23.220> neither<00:04:23.520> one<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:23.790> us<00:04:23.940> can

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
are over here no neither one of us can

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.210 
are over here no neither one of us can
put<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.510> yellow<00:04:24.660> camel<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.260> between<00:04:25.710> because

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
put a yellow camel in between because

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.219 
put a yellow camel in between because
then<00:04:27.090> we<00:04:27.210> would<00:04:27.360> join<00:04:27.540> our<00:04:27.690> caravans<00:04:28.139> and

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
then we would join our caravans and

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.530 
then we would join our caravans and
that's<00:04:28.410> not<00:04:28.530> possible<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> game<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.270> gonna

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
that's not possible so the game is gonna

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.659 
that's not possible so the game is gonna
progress<00:04:31.080> until<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.310> one<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.580> these

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
progress until all of one of these

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.370 
progress until all of one of these
colors<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.540> gone<00:04:33.960> at<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.880> point<00:04:36.570> when<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.289> of

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
colors is gone at that point when one of

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.300 
colors is gone at that point when one of
the<00:04:37.470> colors<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:37.919> gone

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
the colors is gone

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.180 
the colors is gone
the<00:04:38.400> game<00:04:38.580> ends<00:04:39.050> each<00:04:40.050> player's<00:04:40.560> colour<00:04:40.919> line

one<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.470> reasons<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:01.860> think<00:05:01.919> I<00:05:02.190> like

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
one of the reasons I think I like

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.560 
one of the reasons I think I like
through<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.669> desert<00:05:02.970> so<00:05:03.090> much<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.450> fact

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
through the desert so much is the fact

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.250 
through the desert so much is the fact
that<00:05:03.900> it's<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.010> simple<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:06.900> honestly

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
that it's just so simple and I honestly

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.100 
that it's just so simple and I honestly
believe<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.550> best<00:05:08.850> abstract<00:05:09.539> games<00:05:09.840> are

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
believe that the best abstract games are

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.779 
believe that the best abstract games are
the<00:05:10.350> most<00:05:10.590> simple<00:05:10.950> ones<00:05:11.100> on<00:05:11.280> this<00:05:11.430> one

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
the most simple ones on this one

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.670 
the most simple ones on this one
you<00:05:12.030> are<00:05:12.180> simply<00:05:12.539> putting<00:05:13.080> out<00:05:13.200> two<00:05:13.380> camels

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
you are simply putting out two camels

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.469 
you are simply putting out two camels
now<00:05:14.039> that<00:05:14.340> doesn't<00:05:14.550> mean<00:05:14.789> there's<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.060> huge

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
now that doesn't mean there's a huge

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.200 
now that doesn't mean there's a huge
amount<00:05:15.930> of<00:05:16.020> options<00:05:16.500> because<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.610> have<00:05:17.850> five

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
amount of options because you have five

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.060 
amount of options because you have five
camels<00:05:18.539> at<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.900> beginning<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.350> game<00:05:19.470> you

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
camels at the beginning of the game you

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
fact this game has a lot of similarities

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.190 
fact this game has a lot of similarities
to<00:05:34.560> go<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:35.789> know<00:05:35.850> but<00:05:36.330> go<00:05:36.539> purists<00:05:37.110> out

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
to go and I know but go purists out

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.650

there are screaming
it's<00:05:38.840> nothing<00:05:39.260> like<00:05:39.440> go-go<00:05:40.160> is<00:05:40.370> so<00:05:40.580> much

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
it's nothing like go-go is so much

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.210 
it's nothing like go-go is so much
better<00:05:41.060> maybe<00:05:41.390> so<00:05:41.720> but<00:05:41.750> I<00:05:41.990> like<00:05:42.440> this<00:05:42.770> game<00:05:43.040> and

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.780 
I do not let go I understand the appeal
of<00:05:47.360> go<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.780> understand<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.830> classicness<00:05:49.400> and<00:05:49.730> I

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
of go I understand the classicness and I

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.550 
of go I understand the classicness and I
understand<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.300> strategy<00:05:50.930> quite<00:05:51.110> understand

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
understand the strategy quite understand

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.660 
understand the strategy quite understand
a<00:05:51.590> strategy<00:05:51.890> but<00:05:51.980> I<00:05:52.040> mean<00:05:52.190> I<00:05:52.250> understand<00:05:52.580> that

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
a strategy but I mean I understand that

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.820 
a strategy but I mean I understand that
the<00:05:52.730> strategy<00:05:53.180> is<00:05:53.300> there<00:05:53.630> but<00:05:54.470> it's<00:05:54.590> not

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
the strategy is there but it's not

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.950 
the strategy is there but it's not
accessible<00:05:55.490> for<00:05:55.760> me<00:05:55.850> without<00:05:56.030> huge<00:05:56.660> amounts

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
accessible for me without huge amounts

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.960 
accessible for me without huge amounts
of<00:05:57.020> studying<00:05:57.530> while<00:05:58.040> through<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.460> desert<00:05:58.790> is

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
of studying while through the desert is

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.240 
of studying while through the desert is
it's<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.660> game<00:05:59.930> that<00:05:59.960> I<00:06:00.230> think<00:06:00.320> is<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.680> lot<00:06:00.920> of<00:06:01.070> fun

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
it's a game that I think is a lot of fun

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.800 
it's a game that I think is a lot of fun
and<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.490> can<00:06:01.640> play<00:06:01.790> with<00:06:01.820> lots<00:06:02.240> of<00:06:02.330> people<00:06:02.510> and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
and I can play with lots of people and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.430 
and I can play with lots of people and
yet<00:06:03.320> it's<00:06:03.500> very<00:06:04.000> very<00:06:05.000> deep<00:06:05.510> and<00:06:05.780> behind<00:06:06.350> that

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
yet it's very very deep and behind that

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.200 
yet it's very very deep and behind that
so<00:06:06.710> if<00:06:06.800> you<00:06:06.890> even<00:06:06.980> tried<00:06:07.280> it<00:06:07.400> out<00:06:07.490> if<00:06:07.790> you<00:06:08.030> don't

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
so if you even tried it out if you don't

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.060 
so if you even tried it out if you don't
like<00:06:08.330> abstract<00:06:08.630> games<00:06:09.020> give<00:06:09.590> this<00:06:09.740> one<00:06:09.920> a<00:06:09.980> try

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
like abstract games give this one a try

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.610 
like abstract games give this one a try
anyway<00:06:10.490> it's<00:06:11.150> fast<00:06:11.540> it<00:06:11.840> takes<00:06:11.960> about<00:06:12.110> 45

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
anyway it's fast it takes about 45

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.560 
anyway it's fast it takes about 45
minutes<00:06:12.770> to<00:06:13.130> play<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:13.580> yet<00:06:14.090> when<00:06:14.240> you're<00:06:14.330> done

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
minutes to play and yet when you're done

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.720 
minutes to play and yet when you're done
you<00:06:14.780> feel<00:06:15.020> like<00:06:15.290> you<00:06:15.440> played<00:06:15.710> a<00:06:15.740> pretty<00:06:16.190> solid
