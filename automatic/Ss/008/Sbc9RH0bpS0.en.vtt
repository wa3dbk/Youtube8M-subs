00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.770 

yeah<00:02:07.700> maybe<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.149> cheaper<00:02:08.660> oh<00:02:09.280> no<00:02:10.630> cuz<00:02:11.630> it's

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
yeah maybe it's cheaper oh no cuz it's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.680 
yeah maybe it's cheaper oh no cuz it's
free<00:02:11.989> old<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:13.810> mmm<00:02:14.900> how<00:02:15.110> can<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.410> say<00:02:16.690> one

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
free old but mmm how can you say one

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.979 
free old but mmm how can you say one
thing<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.110> don't<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:19.250> body<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.450> serve

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
thing I don't like is the body and serve

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.910 
thing I don't like is the body and serve
because<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.640> kind<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.570> weird<00:02:26.920> when

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
because it so it's kind of weird when

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.840 
because it so it's kind of weird when
you<00:02:28.640> want<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.120> swing<00:02:29.390> fast<00:02:29.750> because<00:02:30.170> it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
you want to swing fast because it's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.910 
you want to swing fast because it's
top-heavy<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:35.450> easy<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.260> like

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
top-heavy and it's not easy to like

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.490 
top-heavy and it's not easy to like
swing<00:02:37.430> through<00:02:37.730> compared<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:41.230> first<00:02:42.230> off

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
swing through compared to like first off

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.090 
swing through compared to like first off
six<00:02:42.859> 190<00:02:43.630> they're<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> top<00:02:45.380> light<00:02:45.620> model

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
six 190 they're like a top light model

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.240 
six 190 they're like a top light model
so<00:02:46.570> they're<00:02:47.570> like<00:02:47.750> more<00:02:48.019> swing<00:02:48.620> easier<00:02:49.100> you

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
so they're like more swing easier you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.259 
so they're like more swing easier you
can<00:02:49.430> do<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.000> something<00:02:51.070> mm-hmm<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:52.459> he<00:02:52.670> has<00:02:52.820> no

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
can do it something mm-hmm but he has no

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.210 
can do it something mm-hmm but he has no
this<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.690> has<00:02:53.959> more<00:02:54.650> power<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:56.390> top<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.220> if

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
this one has more power on the top so if

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.890 
this one has more power on the top so if
you<00:02:58.400> against<00:02:58.850> like<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.269> hard<00:02:59.810> shell<00:03:00.019> player<00:03:00.350> and
