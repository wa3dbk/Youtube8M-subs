actually you might even want to do a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520 
actually you might even want to do a
panel<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.750> start<00:01:31.049> with

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
panel like this to start with

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410

I wouldn't do a whole story at this
depth<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.759> medium<00:01:39.150> shot<00:01:39.590> at<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
depth which is a medium shot at this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.870 
depth which is a medium shot at this
kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> angle<00:01:41.460> we'll<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:42.110> straight<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.880> but

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
kind of angle we'll just straight on but

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
kind of angle we'll just straight on but
whatever<00:01:45.840> well<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.470> gonna<00:01:46.619> tell<00:01:46.860> you

whatever well now I'm gonna tell you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
whatever well now I'm gonna tell you
something<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.610> find<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.360> an<00:01:48.479> artist<00:01:48.810> is

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
something I find that when an artist is

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
something I find that when an artist is
really<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.710> good<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> depth<00:01:50.790> at

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
really as good and there's a depth at

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260 
really as good and there's a depth at
you<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:53.220> difficult<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> draw

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you as you it is very difficult to draw

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179
