00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.609
 Bayonetta 2 was another one of the most 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.230
 sounded to show us in new 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.200
 images because we do not forget that 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.910
 Nintendo is the one who produces exclusively 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.620
 this title for wii for you to do 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.930
 a nintendo idea is who is putting 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.210
 the pasta the video that we are seeing is 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.369
 premiered in that nintendo tired does so 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.410
 only a few hours we could finally see more 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.570
 about that sequel of bayonet that 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.760
 is preparing for wii u this time what 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.039
 we saw in some images that made you see 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.720
 which is a much more mature title than 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.280
 when they taught us at the beginning 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.160
 although it is true that they sneaked 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.930
 the odd image of that demo that 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.239
 it could be enjoyed in fairs so 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.309
 important as the matrix game way by 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.260
 course the playable part of bayonetta 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.809
 is what we stayed with and especially 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.640
 with those huge creatures at 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.710
 that we are going to have to face what 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.719
 most amazing of the images is that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.670
 at no time like what 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.770

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.219
 that demo of the bayonet sequel 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.500
 at no time does the 60 slow down 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.140
 frames per second are present in 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.820

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.600

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.610

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.740
 but it is true that we already know and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.590
