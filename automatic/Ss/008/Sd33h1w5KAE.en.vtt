00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
going to be a lot more steep with the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.070 
going to be a lot more steep with the
swing<00:00:53.699> causing<00:00:54.390> me<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:54.690> come<00:00:55.050> down

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
swing causing me to actually come down

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
got to make sure that we see the ball

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040 
got to make sure that we see the ball
correctly<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.760> amazing<00:01:00.149> fundamental<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
correctly not amazing fundamental but

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
correctly not amazing fundamental but
just<00:01:01.260> making<00:01:01.559> sure<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> balls<00:01:01.980> teed<00:01:02.280> up

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just making sure the balls teed up

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.090 
just making sure the balls teed up
correctly<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:03.000> how<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.020> half<00:01:04.800> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
correctly and how we do that is half the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
correctly and how we do that is half the
golf<00:01:05.250> ball<00:01:05.750> needs<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.899> be<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> top<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.860> the

driver we have it on a tee so when we
hit<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> golf<00:01:37.380> shot<00:01:37.679> instead<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.610> trying<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
hit the golf shot instead of trying to

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.510 
hit the golf shot instead of trying to
hit<00:01:39.119> down<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.050> have<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.319> swing<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.830> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
hit down we actually have to swing up so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
hit down we actually have to swing up so
the<00:01:41.640> reason<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> most<00:01:42.270> golfers<00:01:42.959> sky<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> drive

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the reason that most golfers sky a drive

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.250 
the reason that most golfers sky a drive
is<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.240> tear<00:01:45.539> too<00:01:45.840> low<00:01:46.050> number<00:01:46.380> one

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
is because they tear too low number one

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260 
is because they tear too low number one
and<00:01:47.770> when<00:01:47.890> they<00:01:47.980> get<00:01:48.160> ready<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.610> hit<00:01:48.850> they

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
and when they get ready to hit they

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.750 
and when they get ready to hit they
allow<00:01:49.480> the<00:01:49.540> body<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:50.080> shift<00:01:50.440> forward<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.130> hit

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
allow the body to shift forward and hit

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.450 
allow the body to shift forward and hit
down<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.390> an<00:01:52.540> iron<00:01:52.800> well<00:01:53.800> what<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.220> want<00:01:54.340> to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
down like an iron well what we want to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.130 
down like an iron well what we want to
do<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:54.730> we<00:01:54.820> want<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.000> keep<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.240> body<00:01:55.420> back<00:01:55.810> and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
do is we want to keep the body back and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.100 
do is we want to keep the body back and
to<00:01:56.290> get<00:01:56.440> up<00:01:56.680> like<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.400> driver<00:01:57.760> so<00:01:58.540> we<00:01:58.570> want<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.020> be

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
to get up like a driver so we want to be

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.830 
to get up like a driver so we want to be
in<00:01:59.230> this<00:01:59.350> position<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.070> swing<00:02:00.760> them<00:02:00.940> up<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.720> we

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
in this position and swing them up so we

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.780 
in this position and swing them up so we
actually<00:02:02.020> stay<00:02:02.500> behind<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.280> golf<00:02:03.430> shot

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
actually stay behind the golf shot

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.960 
actually stay behind the golf shot
throughout<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.630> entire<00:02:04.960> swing<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:06.430> we<00:02:06.730> miss<00:02:06.940> a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
throughout the entire swing if we miss a

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.390 
throughout the entire swing if we miss a
drive<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:07.660> actually<00:02:07.930> should<00:02:07.990> target<00:02:08.400> not

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
drive we actually should target not

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.940 
drive we actually should target not
going<00:02:09.790> or<00:02:09.880> Neath<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.300> sky<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.620> order<00:02:11.830> to
