the<00:00:47.129> same

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the same

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
the same
British<00:00:48.180> says<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> same<00:00:48.809> strategy

every<00:00:49.649> single<00:00:49.980> raid<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> really<00:00:51.360> helps

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
every single raid and that really helps

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
every single raid and that really helps
a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.260> when<00:00:52.530> there's<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> lot

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a lot with when there's like not a lot

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.920 
a lot with when there's like not a lot
of<00:00:53.340> strategy<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
of strategy because it's not that like

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.229 
of strategy because it's not that like
I'm<00:00:55.170> an<00:00:55.350> ass<00:00:55.500> attacker<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.640> easy<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.120> me

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
I'm an ass attacker and it's easy for me

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
I'm an ass attacker and it's easy for me
with<00:00:57.390> no<00:00:57.539> strategy<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.890> guys<00:00:59.190> should

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
with no strategy because you guys should

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490 
with no strategy because you guys should
know<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.940> decent<00:01:00.120> attacker<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.870> when

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
know that I'm a decent attacker but when

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.779

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.130 
all you have to do is just make a circle
around<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> base<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.629> makes<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> hell

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
around the base it just makes it a hell

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.899 
around the base it just makes it a hell
of<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.379> easier<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> loot

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.880 
with my king and queen and my archers

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
and luckily I did have my heroes during

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.200 
and luckily I did have my heroes during
this<00:03:09.040> right<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.400> didn't<00:03:09.550> have<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.760> heroes<00:03:10.060> I

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
this right if I didn't have my heroes I

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.880 
this right if I didn't have my heroes I
would<00:03:10.360> not<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.570> gotten<00:03:10.780> like<00:03:11.020> nearly<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:11.680> far

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
would not have gotten like nearly as far

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.190 
would not have gotten like nearly as far
as<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.130> did<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.570> probably<00:03:13.720> should<00:03:13.960> have<00:03:13.990> put

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
as I did and I probably should have put

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.230 
as I did and I probably should have put
in<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.380> archers<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.920> two<00:03:15.430> big<00:03:15.700> clumps<00:03:16.060> rather

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
in the archers in two big clumps rather

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.220 
in the archers in two big clumps rather
than<00:03:16.420> kind<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.630> like<00:03:16.750> spread<00:03:16.960> them<00:03:17.110> out<00:03:17.170> like

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
than kind of like spread them out like

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.140 
than kind of like spread them out like
that<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.950> don't<00:03:18.340> know<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.580> lot<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.000> them

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that because I don't know a lot of them

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.060 
that because I don't know a lot of them
pointlessly<00:03:20.140> died<00:03:20.410> because<00:03:20.800> they're<00:03:20.950> trying

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
pointlessly died because they're trying

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.410 
pointlessly died because they're trying
to<00:03:21.160> break<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:21.580> four<00:03:21.790> walls<00:03:22.030> right<00:03:22.210> now<00:03:22.240> but

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
to break like four walls right now but

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.240 
to break like four walls right now but
the<00:03:22.480> King<00:03:22.660> leads<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.290> fortunately<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
the King leads and fortunately the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.800

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
wizard tower locks on to the king so I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.120 
wizard tower locks on to the king so I
don't<00:03:26.020> have<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.320> worry<00:03:26.470> about<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.860> was<00:03:27.040> your

I<00:06:47.069> didn't<00:06:47.309> upgrade<00:06:47.610> those<00:06:47.729> initially<00:06:48.179> because

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
I didn't upgrade those initially because

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.429 
I didn't upgrade those initially because
I<00:06:48.419> figured<00:06:48.689> that<00:06:48.779> they<00:06:48.839> would<00:06:48.959> be<00:06:49.050> gone<00:06:49.229> after

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
I figured that they would be gone after

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.719 
I figured that they would be gone after
the<00:06:49.740> Halloween<00:06:50.009> update<00:06:50.099> but<00:06:50.429> they<00:06:50.520> weren't

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
the Halloween update but they weren't

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.449 
the Halloween update but they weren't
and<00:06:51.029> I<00:06:51.119> was<00:06:51.270> just<00:06:51.389> stupid<00:06:51.569> I<00:06:51.749> guess<00:06:52.309> but<00:06:53.309> yeah<00:06:53.399> I

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:53.459 
and I was just stupid I guess but yeah I

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:54.739 
and I was just stupid I guess but yeah I
did<00:06:53.580> finally<00:06:53.849> get<00:06:53.969> those<00:06:54.089> two<00:06:54.270> -<00:06:54.449> I'll<00:06:54.659> be

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:54.749 
did finally get those two - I'll be

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:55.790 
did finally get those two - I'll be
upgrading<00:06:55.080> those<00:06:55.139> to<00:06:55.289> three<00:06:55.439> pretty<00:06:55.589> soon

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
upgrading those to three pretty soon

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.679 
upgrading those to three pretty soon
here<00:06:55.919> I<00:06:55.949> think<00:06:56.099> they're<00:06:56.189> like<00:06:56.279> 1.2<00:06:56.789> million<00:06:56.999> to

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
here I think they're like 1.2 million to

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.570 
here I think they're like 1.2 million to
go<00:06:57.779> to<00:06:57.869> three<00:06:58.080> so<00:06:58.289> I<00:06:58.499> was<00:06:58.889> debating<00:06:59.279> getting<00:06:59.520> my

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
go to three so I was debating getting my

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.219
