00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 the defeat against dinamo became moscow 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.980
 washed down this morning on a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.870
 autumnal herdgang 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
 Sunday fc twente waits Wednesday 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.540
 feyenoord and the following week go again 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.639
 ahead eagles 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.300
 but with psv they don't see it as the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.300
 week of truth 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 yes that sounds very heavy 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.800
 it's just an important week true 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.020
 you with 2 top matches 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 against Feyenoord and 20 need finishing 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.279
 is twente and feyenoord and my eggo 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 so get martinus or home in in six 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.880
 days play three games 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.059
 between a busy schedule but not everything 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.800
 determine of course in the struggle for it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 championship that are a determining factor 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 and more importantly we feel a little early 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 have you with it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 I have a very good feeling about it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 you have control over our 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.110
 direct competition 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.410
 so that would be nice and tasty 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.070
 so we still have three home games 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.260
 a 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.060
 This must happen to the penultimate one 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.890
 training for twente was one for it 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.350
 seven players against Dinamo Moscow 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.910
 hardly or never took action in the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.920
 session of saturday how i have you then 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.420
 everyone on board again 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.250
 well there is a way to be truly 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.990
 often recover 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.119
 sometimes the players go play themselves 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.970
 have to get out that they get their 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.920
 recovery training on the field another 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.640
 then they work a program 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.340
 inside on the bike are what 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.009
 so we are stability exercises 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.670
 have now chosen to enter 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.009
 to recover 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.050
 let's focus on twente 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.110
 that a nice team to counter 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.850
 play football because they also play football themselves 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.130
 yes it would be nice if you are against it 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.000
 dared to play against a team there 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.009
 play football 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 because then you yourself have more space 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.149
 often we play against teams that play or 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.430
 he bagged the space so we 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.000
 spaces become smaller 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.530
 but trend is not the case so 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.060
 I always like to 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.150
 grow opponents to play and there 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.160
 hear wins me too and the defeat of 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.979
 yesterday that doesn't work at far or that 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.360
 does not work against you well that 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.690
 in the end we still have to leave that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.570
 see 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.060
 I believe I realize that it is not 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.190
 work against us because we are at 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.290
 flurries back that football shows one 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.520
 have created an opportunity 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.980
 just so that we see a role 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.810
 get in the last few minutes 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.790
 that remains annoying and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.190
 we also have to go very quickly 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.180
 because then it can be our head 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.680
 cost 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.940
 clear language of the supplier 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.950
 the highest rice 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.090
 Sunday afternoon at half past two in the philips 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 stadium against FC Twente
