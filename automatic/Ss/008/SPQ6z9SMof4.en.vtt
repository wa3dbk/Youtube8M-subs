00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:05.439
 and now the honorable Member has the second answer, yes, sir, you said 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.210
 that this program 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.640
 may have manipulated the issue was not very clear to the 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.139
 we will make it very clear now that if you have no defeat or no 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990
 understood how this reading 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.539
 first I want to show you the following how the picture is made the people 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.640
 wants to know 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460
 we carry a computer 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.550
 the person comes who is asking the question you to give an example 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 I'll show you now where the deputy interview was recorded. 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.940
 bolsonaro in a hotel of rio de janeiro jucerja a small hall the silence 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.640
 only our team has it 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.470
 I'll show you the raw material of the question, for example, about racial quotas 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.300
 samarava 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.500
 What are you against racial quotas? 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.890
 I am against because we are equal before the law 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.050
 access in which it appears in the third degree according to the proposal and is 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.739
 merit 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.909
 The goalkeeper is on a plane flown by a quota holder and would not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 operated by a medical practitioner by the competent physician, a pilot who 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 really in accordance with the new rules 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.280
 the last proof that we now have three and life you deputy bolsonaro 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.050
 says that maybe he who is the top scorer who did not understand the question 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.679
 of the black gil by the way I said that this is not the chosen program 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.260
 much more excited she the deputy bolsonaro 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.640
 I told him I want to believe if he did not understand the question when I 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.560
 I said this I wanted to believe with a hope in the soul of the summer 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.150
 that he had cheated but not that he stayed he had not heard 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.710
 and you will see now 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 As an athlete, ask the question. 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.910
 clearly to the question was posed by deputies 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.140
 who had no doubt to answer what he answered 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 paulista 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.149
 they delayed 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.089
 the company will pass the crown 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.479
 or black I will not discuss promiscuity with anyone I do not run 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:26.089
 This risk and my children were very well educated and did not live in the 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.089
 unfortunately it's yours 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:35.319
 because it's there 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.549
 are local salvio you want 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.159
 with the question of the black gil you hear - even the producer is talking to 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.659
 he black gil announced by the mayor asks himself 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.990
 he hears the question answers yes 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.319
 none 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.289
 finally his justification that he would have been wrong to reverse the veto or 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.810
 sex that are words 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.370
 the same problem of homosexual reading the big problem is the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.920
 following unfortunately having made his placement on being in solidarity 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.530
 it's no crime homophobia is simply donated 1 take this guy 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.060
 to jail racism shrinking the meeting obama pressed on time 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.120
 I think I'm going to do the following and I'll repeat the question again and again. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.549
 answer for a very simple reason 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.959
 is this he responds to have until promiscuity is tied to a 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.049
 ambiance that it was created 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.260
 we all know that black 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.380
 is the son of one of the living artists not in Brazil on this planet 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.570
 minister of culture gilberto gil 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.619
 of whom I am admirer 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.249
 so I can say friend of 30 thousand 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.279
 many years 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.439
 and I think we'll see it again just so we do not 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.630
 stay there no doubt 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.309
 both of the question you will hear the voice of the producer speaking now black gil 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:57.739
 the question if his last response to us would end this 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.739
 subject matter 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.449
 at sea the load falls 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.239
 It's cool for 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.729
 or black I will not discuss promiscuity with anyone I do not run 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:19.339
 This risk and my children were very well educated and did not live in the 

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.339
 unfortunately it's yours 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.680
 After the king my dear Brazil you draw your conclusions now I go 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.569
 take the opinion of the erratic expert 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.150
 marco luque 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.610
 Do you want maicon victim? 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.910
 Sure, it's very prejudiced and racism in Brazil. 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.879
 although it seems to be there I think you are gentle that you depend on it 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.219
 goal of mother maternal to have wanted 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.219
 to improve what I expected to see 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.250
 it worked again after not having problem with me until now other 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.050
 actions was therefore a political issue and it is important to show 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.510
 this type of positioning 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.290
 we live in a country that presents we believe in freedom of expression 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.060
 in this case the part that was elected and by stages egypt or not the request 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.110
 is much less important than the fact that there are people who vote and approve the 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.470
 His reasoning for expression is important to people who continue 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.629
 supporting this country has to learn to listen to experience 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.870
 who do you think different 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.270
 has the part this devout subject better in the upcoming elections and hope 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.319
 at the time you assaulted a person because he liked me because she has a 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.409
 sexual orientation differently from the classic and so it is important to 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.149
 and we are showing
