were totally dead and obviously

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.690 
were totally dead and obviously
these<00:01:11.510> laptops<00:01:11.810> are<00:01:12.230> really<00:01:12.470> old<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.220> one<00:01:13.490> is

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
these laptops are really old this one is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.120 
these laptops are really old this one is
more<00:01:14.060> than<00:01:14.090> ten<00:01:14.420> years<00:01:14.660> old<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.710> course<00:01:15.950> the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
more than ten years old so of course the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.250 
more than ten years old so of course the
battery<00:01:16.460> is<00:01:16.580> pretty<00:01:16.820> wait<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.780> could<00:01:18.020> not

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
battery is pretty wait and it could not

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.170 
battery is pretty wait and it could not
hold<00:01:18.620> any<00:01:18.920> charge<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:20.450> what<00:01:21.110> should<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.470> do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
hold any charge so what should I do

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.180 
hold any charge so what should I do
looked<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.600> looked<00:01:23.960> up<00:01:24.110> online<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.860> searched

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
looked on I looked up online I searched

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.460 
looked on I looked up online I searched
for<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.460> replacement<00:01:25.790> battery<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.690> a

them<00:02:19.880> as<00:02:20.060> oversight<00:02:20.570> double-a<00:02:20.989> batteries<00:02:21.440> see

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
them as oversight double-a batteries see

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.479 
them as oversight double-a batteries see
Carteret<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.780> these<00:02:24.709> are<00:02:24.950> lithium-ion

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
Carteret here these are lithium-ion

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.500 
Carteret here these are lithium-ion
cells<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.420> look<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.900> oversight<00:02:27.860> away<00:02:28.510> so

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
cells it look like oversight away so

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.610 
cells it look like oversight away so
technically<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.580> get<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.209> berry<00:02:32.420> out

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
technically if you get the berry out

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.970 
technically if you get the berry out
open<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.739> up<00:02:34.000> you'll<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:35.299> you'll<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.290> lots<00:02:36.799> of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
open it up you'll see you'll see lots of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.880 
open it up you'll see you'll see lots of
these<00:02:37.130> cells<00:02:37.400> connected<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.060> series<00:02:38.299> you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
these cells connected in series you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.620 
these cells connected in series you
could<00:02:39.890> take<00:02:40.220> out<00:02:40.430> these<00:02:40.580> bad<00:02:40.820> cells<00:02:41.120> replace

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
could take out these bad cells replace

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.160 
could take out these bad cells replace
them<00:02:41.810> with<00:02:41.959> good<00:02:42.019> ones<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> brand

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
them with good ones and you have a brand

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.430 
them with good ones and you have a brand
new<00:02:45.230> berry<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.390> I'm<00:02:47.690> going<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.959> put<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.290> this

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
new berry so I'm going to put up this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.340 
new berry so I'm going to put up this
theory<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.100> test<00:02:49.570> I'm<00:02:50.570> going<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.930> take<00:02:51.110> out

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
theory to the test I'm going to take out

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.490 
theory to the test I'm going to take out
very<00:02:52.040> from<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.519> laptop

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.550 

there<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.620> is

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
there it is

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.690 
there it is
pretty<00:03:00.430> funny<00:03:00.670> shake<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.090> say<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:03.010> one<00:03:03.280> problem

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
pretty funny shake I say so one problem

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.620 
pretty funny shake I say so one problem
is<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.630> batteries<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.260> sealed<00:03:05.530> shut

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
is that this batteries are sealed shut

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.240 
is that this batteries are sealed shut
of<00:03:07.630> course<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.140> manufacturer<00:03:08.770> doesn't<00:03:09.010> want

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
of course the manufacturer doesn't want

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.390 
of course the manufacturer doesn't want
people<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.670> tamper<00:03:10.180> with<00:03:10.390> these<00:03:10.540> things<00:03:11.400> but

well<00:04:01.890> since<00:04:02.890> it's<00:04:03.130> got<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.609> really<00:04:04.239> funny

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
well since it's got this really funny

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.550 
well since it's got this really funny
shape<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:06.570> started<00:04:07.570> to<00:04:07.720> twist<00:04:08.109> it<00:04:08.320> like<00:04:08.350> this

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
shape I started to twist it like this

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.090 
shape I started to twist it like this
and<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.790> slipped<00:04:10.239> in<00:04:10.390> action<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.440> was<00:04:11.829> good

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
and this slipped in action it was good

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.890 
and this slipped in action it was good
enough<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.370> loosen<00:04:12.880> up<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.299> glue<00:04:13.329> that<00:04:13.570> was

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
enough to loosen up the glue that was

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.400 
enough to loosen up the glue that was
holding<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.290> battery<00:04:14.530> casing<00:04:15.130> together<00:04:16.410> so

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
holding the battery casing together so

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.710 
holding the battery casing together so
after<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:17.919> few<00:04:18.010> twisting<00:04:18.640> motions<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.450> battery

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
after a few twisting motions the battery

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.380 
after a few twisting motions the battery
was<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.440> casing<00:04:20.859> was<00:04:20.950> completely<00:04:21.519> loose<00:04:21.729> and

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
was the casing was completely loose and

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.600 
was the casing was completely loose and
I<00:04:22.479> could<00:04:22.720> remove<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.169> open<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.740> up<00:04:23.860> right<00:04:24.250> open

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
I could remove it open it up right open

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.190 
I could remove it open it up right open
with<00:04:24.760> my<00:04:24.910> bare<00:04:25.180> hands<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.750> I'm<00:04:25.870> going<00:04:26.140> to

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.500 
with my bare hands and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.890> right<00:04:27.130> now<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.669> can<00:04:28.150> open<00:04:28.419> up

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510
