00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.609
 all right 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.940
 very good to all guys and girls in 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.400
 this video we will continue with the 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.080
 ideas for black ops 3 zombies as I say 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.490
 in many videos these ideas are not mine 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.050
 but they were sent by the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.480
 English community at the time of 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.980
 ascension and call of the dead and some 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.750
 of these ideas have already been used 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.190
 by treyarch in black ops 1 and in black 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.900
 ops 2 so possibly we will see 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.690
 some of these ideas also in black 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.910
 ops 3 in this video we are going to talk about 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.500
 the constructions in effect some of 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.449
 the construcibles that we see in black ops 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.250
 2 already appear in the letter as the 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.480
 trampoline or the turret that I mentioned 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.550
 in a previous video that you have in 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.440
 screen is this why I think that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.510
 crash was based on these ideas for 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.940
 make them buildable from black ops 2 if 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.620
 those damn buildable in the letter 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 of ideas in addition to the buildable as 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.280
 turrets trampolines and traps that already 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.210
 We know of black ops 2 also 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.910
 talks about the construction of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.440
 fortifications of defense towers that 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.780
 is what we are going to focus on this 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.610
 video according to this idea in certain 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.649
 rounds would leave us a time to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.090
 build a fortification on the map 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.550
 it's like it's a defense tower 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.320
 this construction could only be done in 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.940
 certain places on the map and we 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 it would help to gain strategic advantage 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.070
 directing zombies to traps for 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.900
 kill him 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.580
 so this defense tower is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 difference of black construcibles 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.330
 ops 2 in that the things that we 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.190
 we build in black ops 2 become 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.690
 in part of our team while 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.729
 this defense tower is a 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.350
 construction that modifies the environment 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.690
 we are modifying the map in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.150
 certain areas adding barriers 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.340
 walls and other defense elements what 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.710
 which would increase that strategic factor 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 in zombie mode this idea could be very 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 simple for example that we could add 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.650
 here a wall and it is or could be 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.050
 something more complex and can build a 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.670
 true defense tower from scratch and 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.020
 to improve it as the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 starting by adding fences 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.009
 electrified spotlights towers 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.229
 sniper etc. these elements 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.479
 would be purchased with defensive points that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.520
 in the end I will explain and every time it would cost 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.260
 more buy and improve your tower 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.360
 As you can see in the letter of ideas 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.980
 English community put simple images 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.900
 of the different elements that can 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 have our defense tower we have 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.500
 wooden fences that we can scale the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 but the zombies destroy it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.730
 we quickly have spiked wires 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.160
 the zombies pass over and it will make them 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.050
 damage we have several electric that do 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.090
 Damage to zombies while jumping 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.830
 we have brick walls that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.200
 zombies will try to break though them 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.230
 It will cost more than a wooden fence 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.610
 we can put a window on this wall 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.770
 to have more visibility but 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.450
 it would make it easier for the zombies to enter and 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.100
 finally we also have fields of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.720
 mines that we can place outside the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.910
 tower would be how we are going to invest 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.840
 from war at work that if a zombie goes through 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.840
 over explode 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.890
 we also have other elements 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.510
 specials that we could add to 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.150
 our defense tower for example 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.920
 all electrical structures like the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.140
 electric fence or the spotlights that now 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.760
 I will mention should be connected to a cable 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.080
 that will take electricity from a 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.880
 electric terminal 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.830
 this cable should be protected as 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.570
 if the zombies break it the tower will 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.220
 would be without power and most of 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.620
 our traps would no longer work 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.630
 we also have spotlights and projectors for 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.760
 give more light to the tower and we can see 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.530
 much better we also have a mortar 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.450
 which I already talked about in another video that would be 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.640
 like a trap similar to the mortar of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.620
 multiplayer there would also be turrets of 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.660
 nitrogen that would freeze the zombies 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.580
 how the winter howl would also have 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.500
 sniper towers that would be like 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.270
 the trap they already added in fall of 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.910
 dead and finally we have a device 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.830
 called ramblers that would work as a 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.820
 monkey bomb attracting the zombies by 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.820
 the sound that it emits 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.760
 on the screen you have a possible design of 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.680
 the defense tower seen from above to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.630
 the left you have the image of the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.520
 tower just start the game one 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.260
 normal house with four walls and that 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.480
 I would have the electrical terminal for 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.790
 connect the cables and a radar from which 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.410
 I already spoke also in another conformal video 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.360
 advance the game we get points and 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.520
 we buy improvements for our tower the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.140
 we are adding and as you can see in the part 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.720
 on the right we have more walls now 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.940
 more flats traps like turrets wires 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.920
 of skewers the rambler and towers of 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.799
 guards everything connected to the terminal 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.600
 electrical using cables as I said 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.310
 before all these elements and traps are 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.350
 buy with defense points starting 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 from now when you kill a zombie or 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.040
 rebuild barriers or whatever it is that you 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.050
 give points not only you will receive 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.270
 normal points to buy weapons 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.040
 et cetera but also defense points 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.040
 to buy improvements to your tower 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.659
 it should be taken into account that in 

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:46.389
 different maps or each type of zombie 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.639
 prefers to attack a type of trap or 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.409
 determined wall is why it would have 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.059
 to build and improve your tower 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.859
 defense according to the zombies that 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.869
 come and go to the map you 're on 

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:58.449
 playing which as I said would increase 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:00.699
 much more the strategic factor of the mode 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.559
 zombie and I hope you have 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.329
 liked the video I do not believe the truth that 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.889
 add this idea in black ops 3 either 

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:07.809
 I would like it because the game would already be 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.789
 too complex but others as 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.649
 better yes they like the idea that 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.879
 add but add it as 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.709
 something secondary that if you want 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.809
 you build that tower if you want not the 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:18.459
 you build only three videos left 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.839
 of this series so greetings and we 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.839
 we see the next video bye bye
