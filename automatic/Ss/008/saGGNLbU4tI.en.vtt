00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.080 

I'm<00:00:18.300> convinced<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.349> in<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.670> future

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I'm convinced that in the future

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.810 
I'm convinced that in the future
learning<00:00:22.079> surgery<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.790> job<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.810> not

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
learning surgery on the job is not

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:34.470 
learning surgery on the job is not
acceptable

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.200 

I<00:00:34.770> wanted<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.950> start<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.520> minimum<00:00:36.940> wage

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
I wanted to start the minimum wage

mitral<00:00:37.750> valve<00:00:37.930> surgery<00:00:38.170> program<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
mitral valve surgery program and I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.790 
mitral valve surgery program and I
realized<00:00:41.680> that<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.020> is<00:00:44.170> so<00:00:44.350> complex

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
realized that because it is so complex

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.479 
realized that because it is so complex
procedure<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.600> learning<00:00:46.949> curve<00:00:47.949> is<00:00:48.250> so

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
procedure and the learning curve is so

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.290 
procedure and the learning curve is so
steep<00:00:48.970> it<00:00:49.510> is<00:00:49.960> more<00:00:50.230> efficient<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.370> provide<00:00:51.879> or

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
steep it is more efficient to provide or

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.100 
steep it is more efficient to provide or
to<00:00:52.480> develop<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:53.199> simulator<00:00:54.269> on<00:00:55.269> which<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.780> can

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
to develop a simulator on which you can

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.740 
to develop a simulator on which you can
practice<00:00:56.949> and<00:00:57.280> develop<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:58.269> skills

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
practice and develop the skills

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.590 
practice and develop the skills
necessary<00:00:58.960> for<00:00:59.650> doing<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> operation<00:01:00.790> then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
necessary for doing the operation then

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.170 
necessary for doing the operation then
starting<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.260> program<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:03.190> developing<00:01:03.970> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
starting the program and developing the

a robot and you open the lid you see the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.389 
a robot and you open the lid you see the
papillary<00:02:03.130> muscles<00:02:05.099> it's<00:02:06.099> also<00:02:06.509> disposable

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
papillary muscles it's also disposable

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.229 
papillary muscles it's also disposable
this<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> disposable<00:02:10.270> mitral<00:02:11.230> valve

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this is the disposable mitral valve

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.330 
this is the disposable mitral valve
created<00:02:13.239> from<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> special<00:02:14.680> material<00:02:15.310> that

valve you can put it here in the
simulator

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.650 

this<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.390> not<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:40.099> simulator<00:02:41.150> with<00:02:42.150> which<00:02:42.390> you

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
this is not a simulator with which you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.770 
this is not a simulator with which you
just<00:02:43.170> practice<00:02:43.800> some<00:02:45.200> mechanical<00:02:46.200> skills

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
just practice some mechanical skills

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.650 
just practice some mechanical skills
it's<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.900> kind<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.980> intelligence<00:02:50.660> simulator

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it's a kind of intelligence simulator

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.150 
it's a kind of intelligence simulator
because<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.530> gives<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.950> feedback<00:02:53.900> feedback

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
because it gives you feedback feedback

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080 
because it gives you feedback feedback
from<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.519> computer<00:02:57.450> who<00:02:57.989> observes<00:02:59.090> exactly

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
from a computer who observes exactly

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.170 
from a computer who observes exactly
what<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.450> are<00:03:00.480> doing<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.349> looks<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
what you are doing and looks at the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.640 
what you are doing and looks at the
critical<00:03:03.900> steps<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.970> informs<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.239> about<00:03:06.840> for

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
critical steps and informs you about for

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.940 
critical steps and informs you about for
instance<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.549> depth<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:10.110> stitches<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
instance the depth of the stitches you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.319 
instance the depth of the stitches you
put<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.519> valve<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:14.280> simulator<00:03:14.819> can<00:03:15.150> be

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
put in the valve the simulator can be

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.509 
put in the valve the simulator can be
used<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.970> maintain<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:19.260> practice<00:03:20.190> those

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
used to maintain and practice those

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.589 
used to maintain and practice those
skills<00:03:21.410> before<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> operations<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> that

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
skills before the operations so that

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.190 
skills before the operations so that
your<00:03:25.049> learning<00:03:25.470> curve<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:26.010> less<00:03:26.549> steep<00:03:27.200> so

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
your learning curve is less steep so

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.119 
your learning curve is less steep so
I've<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> badger<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.379> see<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.799> depth

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
I've put a badger so you see the depth

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.229 
I've put a badger so you see the depth
of<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.819> suture<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.859> one<00:03:34.859> point<00:03:35.190> seven<00:03:35.489> almost

millimeter<00:03:44.850> with<00:03:45.840> wider<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.980> gives<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.549> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
millimeter with wider it gives you the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.740 
millimeter with wider it gives you the
opportunity<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:49.709> experience<00:03:50.639> what<00:03:51.599> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
opportunity to experience what the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.710 
opportunity to experience what the
boundaries<00:03:52.260> are<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:53.250> your<00:03:55.280> interventions<00:03:56.720> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
boundaries are of your interventions so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.349 
boundaries are of your interventions so
but<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.989> suture<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.620> too<00:03:59.280> broad<00:03:59.549> but<00:03:59.910> the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
but the suture is too broad but the

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.199 
but the suture is too broad but the
depth<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:01.489> okay<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.230> we<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.590> also<00:04:04.829> see<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
depth is okay so we can also see the

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.250 
depth is okay so we can also see the
suture

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
suture

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.289 
suture
one<00:04:08.349> of<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.620> features<00:04:09.099> of<00:04:09.129> this<00:04:09.430> simulator<00:04:09.970> is

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
one of the features of this simulator is

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.069 
one of the features of this simulator is
not<00:04:10.599> only<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.290> training<00:04:11.920> station<00:04:12.480> but<00:04:13.480> it<00:04:13.720> can

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
not only a training station but it can

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.550 
not only a training station but it can
be<00:04:14.349> used<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:16.060> clinical<00:04:16.359> setting<00:04:16.930> for

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
be used in a clinical setting for

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.920 
be used in a clinical setting for
pre-planning<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.609> complex<00:04:19.239> procedures

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
pre-planning of complex procedures

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.760 
pre-planning of complex procedures
because<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.070> disposable<00:04:21.970> mitral<00:04:22.419> valve<00:04:22.770> can

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
because the disposable mitral valve can

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.060 
because the disposable mitral valve can
be<00:04:23.800> replaced<00:04:24.430> by<00:04:24.880> 3d<00:04:25.600> printed<00:04:26.229> mitral<00:04:26.830> valve

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
be replaced by 3d printed mitral valve

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.930 
be replaced by 3d printed mitral valve
of<00:04:27.310> individual<00:04:28.090> patients<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.470> make<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.130> 3d

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
of individual patients so you make it 3d

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.560 
of individual patients so you make it 3d
prints<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.410> valve<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.979> your<00:04:33.220> patient<00:04:33.789> put

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
prints of the valve of your patient put

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.170 
prints of the valve of your patient put
it<00:04:34.780> in<00:04:35.020> our<00:04:35.110> simulator<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.190> then<00:04:36.789> you<00:04:36.940> can

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
it in our simulator and then you can

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.020 
it in our simulator and then you can
practice<00:04:37.720> how<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.050> solve<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:39.220> problem<00:04:39.729> of<00:04:39.850> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
practice how to solve the problem of the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.520 
practice how to solve the problem of the
insufficiency<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.560> valve
