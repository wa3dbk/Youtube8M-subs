for you guys so basically Mothra is one
of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.699> kaiju<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> Godzilla<00:00:24.930> movies<00:00:25.490> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
of the kaiju in the Godzilla movies the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.759 
of the kaiju in the Godzilla movies the
first<00:00:26.730> time<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> appeared<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> movie

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
first time it appeared was in the movie

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.020 
first time it appeared was in the movie
Mothra<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.519> believe<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.289> 1961<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.369> just

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
Mothra I believe in 1961 and then I just

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
Mothra I believe in 1961 and then I just
finished<00:00:33.360> watching<00:00:33.540> which<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> big

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
finished watching which is a big

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.220 
finished watching which is a big
coincidence<00:00:35.059> Godzilla<00:00:36.059> versus<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.989> thing

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
coincidence Godzilla versus the thing

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.619 
coincidence Godzilla versus the thing
which<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> Godzilla<00:00:38.520> versus<00:00:38.879> Mothra<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> think

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
which is Godzilla versus Mothra I think

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.869 
which is Godzilla versus Mothra I think
that's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.989> movie<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.430> mistaken

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that's a movie from if I'm not mistaken

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.740 
that's a movie from if I'm not mistaken
1964<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.370> said<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> Revoltech

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
1964 and like I said this is a Revoltech

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.319 
1964 and like I said this is a Revoltech
figure<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.340> does<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> revolver

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
figure so it does have the revolver

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.630 
figure so it does have the revolver
joints<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.770> most<00:00:49.920> articulated

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
joints it's not the most articulated

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
joints it's not the most articulated
thing<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> planet<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.899> really

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
thing on the planet it's not really

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
thing on the planet it's not really
intended<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.829> instead<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> starting<00:00:53.820> off

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
intended to be instead of starting off

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.130 
intended to be instead of starting off
with<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> base<00:00:54.270> figure<00:00:54.539> I've<00:00:54.840> already

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
with a base figure I've already

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.049 
with a base figure I've already
assembled<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> pieces<00:00:56.280> together<00:00:56.579> just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
which is that much and then you know the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.649 
which is that much and then you know the
little<00:01:54.990> movement<00:01:55.350> side<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> side<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.009> legs

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
little movement side to side the legs

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.420 
little movement side to side the legs
are<00:01:57.659> not<00:01:58.290> movable<00:01:58.619> they're<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.250> on

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
are not movable they're not on

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.410 
are not movable they're not on
microscopic<00:02:00.210> Revoltech<00:02:00.899> joints<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:03.149> head

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
microscopic Revoltech joints the head

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.969 
microscopic Revoltech joints the head
does<00:02:04.290> move<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> revolver<00:02:05.460> joint<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
does move on a revolver joint like so

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.089

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
nice I mean check that out it's not your

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.490 
nice I mean check that out it's not your
typical<00:02:29.360> Revoltech<00:02:30.360> figure<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.380> is

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
typical Revoltech figure but this is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
typical Revoltech figure but this is
beautiful<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> check<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.850> out<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.300> wings

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
beautiful and check this out the wings

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.770 
beautiful and check this out the wings
are<00:02:34.970> separate<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> top<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> bottom

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
are separate for the top and the bottom

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.840 
are separate for the top and the bottom
here<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.640> nice<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.750> little

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
here which is really nice the little

details like the feet and the antennae

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.370 
details like the feet and the antennae
obviously<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.860> PVC<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:45.600> feels<00:02:46.170> like<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
obviously are PVC this feels like a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.230 
obviously are PVC this feels like a
harder<00:02:46.680> plastic<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.340> might<00:02:47.580> not<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> PVC

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
harder plastic this might not be a PVC

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.710 
harder plastic this might not be a PVC
it's<00:02:48.510> probably<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.260> ABS<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:51.060> overall<00:02:51.360> very

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it's probably just ABS but overall very

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.110 
it's probably just ABS but overall very
nice<00:02:51.900> get<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.190> tad<00:02:53.400> closer<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.030> can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
nice get in just a tad closer so you can

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.460

you'll see there's a hold there that one
piece<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.590> took<00:04:10.680> off<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.250> Mothra<00:04:13.700> goes<00:04:14.700> in

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
piece that I took off of Mothra goes in

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.199 
piece that I took off of Mothra goes in
here<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:16.250> holds<00:04:17.250> Mothra<00:04:17.640> here<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.060> he's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
here and holds Mothra here so he's

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.720 
here and holds Mothra here so he's
actually<00:04:18.390> a<00:04:18.660> lot<00:04:18.840> closer<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:20.430> he's<00:04:20.580> basically

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
actually a lot closer so he's basically

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.790 
actually a lot closer so he's basically
on<00:04:21.180> top<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.570> cocoon<00:04:21.900> here<00:04:22.109> as<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.590> can<00:04:22.620> see
