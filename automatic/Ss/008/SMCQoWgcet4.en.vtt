00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
welcome to episode 36 of mini mods and

welcome to episode 36 of mini mods and
in<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.719> episodes<00:00:13.200> could<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.530> similar<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
in this episodes could be similar to the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.400 
in this episodes could be similar to the
previous<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.519> because<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.599> state<00:00:15.900> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
previous one because at this state that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.840 
previous one because at this state that
this<00:00:16.619> episode<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> previous<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.580> are

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this episode and the previous one are

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.970 
this episode and the previous one are
pretty<00:00:18.090> much<00:00:18.150> gonna<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.420> tweaks<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.199> 1.5<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
pretty much gonna be tweaks for 1.5 that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160 
pretty much gonna be tweaks for 1.5 that
I<00:00:20.039> feel<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:20.609> very<00:00:20.760> necessary<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.480> thus

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
I feel that are very necessary and thus

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
I feel that are very necessary and thus
I<00:00:22.410> am<00:00:22.560> choosing<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.189> mini<00:00:23.369> mods<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.910> these

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
I am choosing the mini mods for these

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.089 
I am choosing the mini mods for these
two<00:00:24.210> episodes<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.230> other<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> had<00:00:26.070> in

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
two episodes now the other one I had in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.009 
two episodes now the other one I had in
mind<00:00:26.430> based<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> comments<00:00:27.750> from<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> last

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
mind based on the comments from the last

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.310 
mind based on the comments from the last
one<00:00:28.289> was<00:00:29.189> having<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> old<00:00:30.320> skeleton

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
one was having the old skeleton

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.100 
one was having the old skeleton
mechanics<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.040> point<00:00:32.189> four<00:00:32.489> into<00:00:32.790> 1.5<00:00:33.510> but

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
mechanics at one point four into 1.5 but

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
mechanics at one point four into 1.5 but
when<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.290> comes<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> many<00:00:34.710> mods<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.130> kind<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
when it comes to many mods it's kind of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
when it comes to many mods it's kind of
a<00:00:35.550> compromise<00:00:35.969> between<00:00:36.149> myself<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> Telex<00:00:37.140> we

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
a compromise between myself and Telex we

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350 
a compromise between myself and Telex we
kind<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.500> vote<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> mini<00:00:38.610> mod<00:00:38.790> suggestions

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
kind of vote on the mini mod suggestions

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
kind of vote on the mini mod suggestions
and<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:40.050> choose<00:00:40.290> ones<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:41.010> practical

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and we choose ones that are practical

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.260 
and we choose ones that are practical
not<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.600> difficult<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
not so difficult and are actually you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.510 
not so difficult and are actually you
know<00:00:45.440> reasonable<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.100> came<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
know reasonable but it came to the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
know reasonable but it came to the
conclusion<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.420> skeleton<00:00:48.809> mechanics

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
conclusion that the skeleton mechanics

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189 
conclusion that the skeleton mechanics
wasn't<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> done<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.600> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
wasn't going to be done in this one so

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.389 
wasn't going to be done in this one so
unfortunately<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.309> done

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
unfortunately that's not gonna be done

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
unfortunately that's not gonna be done
but<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.360> useful<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.559> instead

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
but we have a very useful one instead

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
but we have a very useful one instead
which<00:00:56.579> honestly<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> almost<00:00:57.809> as

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
which honestly I think this is almost as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.869 
which honestly I think this is almost as
great<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:59.180> if<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> guys<00:01:00.480> didn't<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
great because if you guys didn't know a

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
great because if you guys didn't know a
1.5<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.809> flows<00:01:04.409> extremely<00:01:05.129> fast<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
1.5 a lot of flows extremely fast and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.700 
1.5 a lot of flows extremely fast and
the<00:01:05.729> nether<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> end<00:01:06.720> many<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the nether and in the end many of you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
the nether and in the end many of you
probably<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.340> yet<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.720> now

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
probably don't know this yet or just now

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
probably don't know this yet or just now
figured<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.500> after<00:01:10.740> 1.5<00:01:11.310> command<00:01:11.670> because

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
figured it out after 1.5 command because

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
figured it out after 1.5 command because
I<00:01:12.210> was<00:01:12.420> never<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.750> patch<00:01:12.960> notes<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.500> was

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
I was never in the patch notes it was

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
I was never in the patch notes it was
never<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> Minecraft<00:01:14.850> Wiki<00:01:15.049> it<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.200> kind

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
never in the Minecraft Wiki it was kind

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
never in the Minecraft Wiki it was kind
of<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> hidden<00:01:17.040> update<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.939> figured<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> out

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of like a hidden update I figured it out

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
of like a hidden update I figured it out
pretty<00:01:19.049> fast<00:01:19.259> cuz<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
only one that places snapshots instead

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
only one that places snapshots instead
of<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.960> reviews<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.500> why<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.400> both<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> them

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
of just reviews them why do both of them

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.480 
of just reviews them why do both of them
whoa<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.130> lighting<00:01:26.340> just

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
whoa what was that the lighting just

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.899 
whoa what was that the lighting just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the nether the nether just went all dark

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.420 
the nether the nether just went all dark
and<00:01:32.189> such<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.150> enough<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> okay<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.040> what

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
right now a before and after clip I did

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.679 
right now a before and after clip I did
and<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> send<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> dinner<00:01:41.400> bones<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and I send it to dinner bones now in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.480 
and I send it to dinner bones now in
this<00:01:42.869> clip<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.320> show<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.920> before<00:01:44.040> and

this clip I just show that before and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.789 
this clip I just show that before and
the<00:01:44.610> after<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.479> much<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.020> overworld

lava flowing mechanics for the nether
and<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.490> end<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:23.180> course<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.720> said<00:02:23.900> we're

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
and the end of course like I said we're

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.480 
and the end of course like I said we're
not<00:02:24.200> really<00:02:24.319> gonna<00:02:24.470> use<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.770> end<00:02:24.950> so

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
not really gonna use the end so

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.020 
not really gonna use the end so
introducing<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.690> slow<00:02:27.020> lava<00:02:27.350> mod<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:29.000> I

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
introducing this slow lava mod so like I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.059 
introducing this slow lava mod so like I
saw<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.540> clip<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.900> lava<00:02:30.230> flows<00:02:30.440> extremely

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
saw in the clip the lava flows extremely

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.880 
saw in the clip the lava flows extremely
fast<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:31.930> what<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.050> mod<00:02:33.230> allows<00:02:33.260> us<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.770> do

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
fast but what this mod allows us to do

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.010 
fast but what this mod allows us to do
is<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.160> place<00:02:34.430> lava<00:02:34.670> anywhere<00:02:35.239> like<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.870> this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
is if I place lava anywhere like in this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.140 
is if I place lava anywhere like in this
case<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.319> ceiling<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.130> will<00:02:37.250> flow<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.970> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
case the ceiling it will flow just the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.080 
case the ceiling it will flow just the
way<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.420> did<00:02:38.600> right<00:02:39.170> before<00:02:39.319> 1.5<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:40.910> way

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
way it did right before 1.5 so this way

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.910 
way it did right before 1.5 so this way
if<00:02:41.360> you're<00:02:41.569> no<00:02:41.870> like<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.350> example<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.800> I'm

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
if you're no like for example if I'm

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.400 
if you're no like for example if I'm
over<00:02:43.220> here<00:02:43.550> let's<00:02:44.060> say<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.239> am<00:02:44.450> mining<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.260> is

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
over here let's say I am mining this is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.900 
over here let's say I am mining this is
what<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.680> will<00:02:45.830> happend<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.130> me<00:02:46.220> like<00:02:46.430> when<00:02:46.880> I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
what this will happend to me like when I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.420 
what this will happend to me like when I
first<00:02:47.209> test<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.870> out<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.890> let's<00:02:49.250> have<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
first test this out so let's have the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.949 
first test this out so let's have the
lava<00:02:49.760> bucket<00:02:50.090> right<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:50.480> let's<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.810> this

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
lava bucket right here let's have this

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.140 
lava bucket right here let's have this
here<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.380> break<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.220> said<00:02:52.370> oh<00:02:52.459> crap<00:02:52.700> must

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
here I break this I said oh crap must

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.870 
here I break this I said oh crap must
close<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.380> current<00:02:54.680> game<00:02:54.950> 1.5<00:02:55.519> if<00:02:55.730> I

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
close it up in the current game 1.5 if I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.250 
close it up in the current game 1.5 if I
break<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.209> immediately<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.900> thing<00:02:57.110> will

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
break this immediately this thing will

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.110 
break this immediately this thing will
just<00:02:57.290> flow<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:57.860> top<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.160> me<00:02:58.250> flow<00:02:58.760> right<00:02:58.940> here

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
just flow on top of me flow right here

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.910 
just flow on top of me flow right here
just<00:02:59.330> completely<00:02:59.660> annihilate<00:03:00.440> me<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.739> it's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
just completely annihilate me and it's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.890 
just completely annihilate me and it's
not<00:03:01.069> really<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.400> fun<00:03:01.700> like<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.630> point

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
not really that fun like to the point

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.320 
not really that fun like to the point
that<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.350> can't<00:03:03.769> even<00:03:03.890> survive<00:03:04.459> or<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.970> can't

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
that I can't even survive or I can't

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.229 
that I can't even survive or I can't
even<00:03:05.480> defend<00:03:05.690> myself<00:03:05.900> over<00:03:06.380> how<00:03:06.650> fast<00:03:06.890> lava<00:03:07.519> so

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
even defend myself over how fast lava so

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.940 
even defend myself over how fast lava so
that's<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.480> reason<00:03:08.630> why<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:09.050> mod<00:03:09.290> exists

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
that's the reason why this mod exists

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.360 
that's the reason why this mod exists
the<00:03:10.480> slow<00:03:11.480> bomb<00:03:12.080> on<00:03:12.230> other<00:03:12.800> guy<00:03:12.920> said<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.190> old

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the slow bomb on other guy said the old

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.090 
the slow bomb on other guy said the old
mod<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.780> some<00:03:14.900> reason<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.170> don't<00:03:15.230> know<00:03:15.350> why<00:03:15.380> but

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
mod for some reason I don't know why but

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.289 
mod for some reason I don't know why but
yeah<00:03:16.550> that's<00:03:16.730> pretty<00:03:16.850> much<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.090> with<00:03:17.209> this

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
yeah that's pretty much it with this

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.910 
yeah that's pretty much it with this
episode<00:03:17.600> minimize<00:03:18.049> it's<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.290> very<00:03:18.470> short<00:03:18.709> one

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
episode minimize it's a very short one

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.310 
episode minimize it's a very short one
um<00:03:19.130> it's<00:03:19.840> allows<00:03:21.160> lava<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.850> finally<00:03:23.480> slow<00:03:23.840> go

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
um it's allows lava to finally slow go

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.970 
um it's allows lava to finally slow go
very<00:03:24.560> slow<00:03:24.829> just<00:03:25.790> how<00:03:26.000> was<00:03:26.299> for<00:03:26.600> many<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.290> guess

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
very slow just how was for many I guess

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.650 
very slow just how was for many I guess
years<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.489> guess<00:03:28.640> technically<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.329> years

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
years I guess technically it is years
