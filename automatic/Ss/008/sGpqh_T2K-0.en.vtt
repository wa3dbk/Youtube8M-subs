that<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.489> whatever<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.269> strongest

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that you know whatever the strongest

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.850 
that you know whatever the strongest
beer<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.019> brew<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.289> something<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
beer you can brew or something like that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.289 
beer you can brew or something like that
and<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.459> try<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> sort<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
and so I try to have a sort of a

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.509 
and so I try to have a sort of a
culinary<00:02:12.810> mindset<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:14.430> I

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
culinary mindset you know and so look I

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.800 
culinary mindset you know and so look I
don't<00:02:14.580> say<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.030> wouldn't<00:02:15.420> want<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.600> brew<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
don't say I wouldn't want to brew the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.420 
don't say I wouldn't want to brew the
saltiest<00:02:16.200> dish<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:16.620> ever<00:02:16.769> been<00:02:16.950> made<00:02:17.160> or

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
saltiest dish that's ever been made or

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.860 
saltiest dish that's ever been made or
you<00:02:17.670> know<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.940> doesn't<00:02:18.209> make<00:02:18.299> any<00:02:18.390> sense<00:02:18.630> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you know it doesn't make any sense you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.059 
you know it doesn't make any sense you
know<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.140> try<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.319> think<00:02:19.590> about<00:02:19.769> sort<00:02:20.010> of

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
know so I try to think about sort of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.820 
know so I try to think about sort of
balanced<00:02:20.519> flavors<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.080> sort<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.380> you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
balanced flavors and so that sort of you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.500 
balanced flavors and so that sort of you
know<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.069> think<00:02:23.190> about<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.610> another<00:02:23.819> form

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
know I just think about is another form

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
know I just think about is another form
of<00:02:24.660> sort<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.900> cooking<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.709> know<00:02:25.799> so<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
of sort of cooking really you know so I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.130 
of sort of cooking really you know so I
think<00:02:26.040> that's<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.549> lot<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.299> where<00:02:27.510> my<00:02:27.720> mindset

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
think that's a lot of where my mindset

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.220 
think that's a lot of where my mindset
is<00:02:28.290> when<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.590> come<00:02:28.709> I'm<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> brewing<00:02:30.230> we

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
is when it come I'm just a brewing we

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.390 
is when it come I'm just a brewing we
knew<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.500> there<00:02:31.650> was<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> lot<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.070> excitement

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
knew that there was a lot of excitement

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.789 
knew that there was a lot of excitement
building<00:02:32.790> up<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.390> write<00:02:33.720> proper<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.680> we
