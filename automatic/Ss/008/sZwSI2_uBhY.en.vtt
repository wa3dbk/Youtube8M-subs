00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.379 

all<00:00:01.469> right<00:00:01.650> hi<00:00:02.010> guys<00:00:02.280> it's<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.760> Cuba<00:00:03.240> one

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
all right hi guys it's the Cuba one

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.599 
all right hi guys it's the Cuba one
thank<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.810> for<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:04.980> here<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.339> show<00:00:05.400> you

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
thank you for and I'm here to show you

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.310 
thank you for and I'm here to show you
how<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.120> solve<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.379> 2<00:00:08.280> by<00:00:08.400> 2<00:00:08.429> cube<00:00:09.380> um<00:00:12.320> alright

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
how to solve the 2 by 2 cube um alright

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.310 
how to solve the 2 by 2 cube um alright
so<00:00:14.960> basically<00:00:15.960> there's<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.859> algorithms<00:00:17.210> and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
so basically there's two algorithms and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.380 
so basically there's two algorithms and
the<00:00:19.320> rest<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.740> hands<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.029> let's<00:00:21.210> get

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the rest is just hands on so let's get

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.290 
the rest is just hands on so let's get
started<00:00:22.310> we're<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> work<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.939> solving

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
started we're going to work on solving

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.259 
started we're going to work on solving
the<00:00:24.840> first<00:00:25.529> um<00:00:26.900> side<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> now<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> do<00:00:30.090> this

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the first um side so now to do this

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
the first um side so now to do this
we're<00:00:31.260> gonna<00:00:31.349> look<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.740> our<00:00:31.859> black<00:00:32.219> piece

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
we're gonna look at our black piece

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
we're gonna look at our black piece
that's<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.000> top<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:34.079> wherever<00:00:34.559> around<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that's on top or wherever around the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
that's on top or wherever around the
cube<00:00:36.410> let's<00:00:37.410> start<00:00:37.590> off<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.340> sign<00:00:39.050> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
cube let's start off with this sign and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.770 
cube let's start off with this sign and
this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> blue<00:00:41.340> piece<00:00:41.640> right<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:41.910> so

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
this is the blue piece right here so

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
this is the blue piece right here so
then<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> look<00:00:43.410> around<00:00:43.620> cube<00:00:44.239> for

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
then we're going to look around cube for

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
then we're going to look around cube for
a<00:00:45.270> black<00:00:45.719> piece<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> blue<00:00:46.559> piece<00:00:46.829> which<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
a black piece of the blue piece which is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.970 
a black piece of the blue piece which is
right<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.780> I'm<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> under<00:00:49.739> where<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
right there so I'm get it under where it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
right there so I'm get it under where it
needs<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:51.350> um<00:00:52.460> I'll<00:00:53.460> put<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> lid<00:00:54.120> and<00:01:03.199> now

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
needs to go um I'll put a lid and now

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.859 
needs to go um I'll put a lid and now
it's<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:06.720> lined<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.869> say

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's up there with this lined up and say

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.460 
it's up there with this lined up and say
this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.080> our<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.640> arms<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
this is our see how this is arms are you

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.109 
this is our see how this is arms are you
find<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> black<00:01:13.740> piece<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> orange<00:01:14.790> mine

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
find the black piece of the orange mine

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:28.190 
find the black piece of the orange mine
happens<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.750> right<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.210> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.139 

and<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.520> lined<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:32.189> find<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.000> last

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
and that's lined up and find the last

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.539 
and that's lined up and find the last
piece<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:35.000> put<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
piece just put it up and you have the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.240 
piece just put it up and you have the
first<00:01:39.770> side<00:01:40.770> salt<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:43.619> only<00:01:43.979> should<00:01:44.039> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
first side salt and not only should you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
first side salt and not only should you
have<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.700> solved<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.840> should<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
have that solved is you should have the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.600 
have that solved is you should have the
first<00:01:46.670> place<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:49.069> right<00:01:50.069> so<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:50.369> you're

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
first place all right so now you're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
first place all right so now you're
going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.789> do<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.179> going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> live<00:01:51.539> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
going to do is you're going to live on

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.169 
going to do is you're going to live on
the<00:01:51.780> top<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.340> where<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> algorithms

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
the top this is where the algorithms

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.819 
the top this is where the algorithms
come<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.899> you're<00:01:55.110> wondering<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.679> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
come in if you're wondering what the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
come in if you're wondering what the
algorithms<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:57.179> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.539> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
algorithms are there going to be in a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.020 
algorithms are there going to be in a
strip<00:01:58.069> description<00:01:59.069> box<00:01:59.369> over<00:01:59.909> there<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.860> um

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
strip description box over there and um

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.279 
strip description box over there and um
yeah<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.670> all<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.849> now<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:07.110> L

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
yeah so all right now you have the L

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.999 
yeah so all right now you have the L
here<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:10.140> you're<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.799> to<00:02:10.890> do

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here and then so you're just going to do

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.199 
here and then so you're just going to do
this<00:02:11.130> algorithm<00:02:12.380> right<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.920> right<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.030> bring

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
this algorithm right up right and bring

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.400 
this algorithm right up right and bring
it<00:02:15.329> up<00:02:15.480> right<00:02:16.019> up<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.920> write<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.489> read<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:18.410> any

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
it up right up to write and read it any

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.930 
it up right up to write and read it any
other<00:02:19.709> over<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
other over here and then just do it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.650 
other over here and then just do it
again<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.450> many<00:02:21.660> times<00:02:22.459> until<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.910> full

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
again as many times until this full

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.920 
again as many times until this full
yellow<00:02:25.200> side<00:02:25.590> gets<00:02:25.980> solved<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.450> let's<00:02:27.599> just<00:02:27.780> do

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
yellow side gets solved so let's just do

00:02:27.930 --> 00:03:15.160 
yellow side gets solved so let's just do
that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:32.690 

keep<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:18.349> so<00:03:19.349> eventually<00:03:19.739> gets<00:03:20.519> all<00:03:31.700> make

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
keep on it so eventually gets all make

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.000 
keep on it so eventually gets all make
sure<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.599> bottom<00:03:33.780> corner<00:03:33.959> to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.759 

surface<00:03:38.010> saying<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.849> about<00:03:41.480> burial

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
surface saying that to a about burial

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.030 
surface saying that to a about burial
all<00:03:43.769> right<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.099> that<00:03:44.370> should<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.640> salt<00:03:46.040> then

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
all right now that should be salt then

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.110 
all right now that should be salt then
so<00:03:47.579> then<00:03:47.760> what<00:03:48.090> we're<00:03:48.180> going<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.390> do<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:50.120> we're

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
so then what we're going to do is we're

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.199 
so then what we're going to do is we're
gonna<00:03:52.700> do<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:54.590> match<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.889> up<00:03:56.040> like<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
gonna do that match it up like that and

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.740 
gonna do that match it up like that and
then<00:04:00.209> we're<00:04:00.780> gonna<00:04:01.400> do<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.880> last<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.510> final

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
then we're gonna do the last and final

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.309 
then we're gonna do the last and final
algorithm<00:04:06.290> which<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:09.260> um<00:04:10.519> right<00:04:11.519> inverted

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
algorithm which is um right inverted

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.949 
algorithm which is um right inverted
front<00:04:13.319> right<00:04:14.190> inverter<00:04:14.669> back<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:16.880> write<00:04:17.959> one

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
front right inverter back to write one

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.390 
front right inverter back to write one
raised<00:04:19.410> right<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.160> reverted<00:04:20.609> back<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:22.400> write

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
raised right and reverted back to write

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.870 
raised right and reverted back to write
to<00:04:25.849> write<00:04:26.849> into<00:04:27.479> action

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
to write into action

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.940 
to write into action
and<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.570> should<00:04:29.780> have<00:04:29.960> another<00:04:30.230> completed

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
and you should have another completed

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.030 
and you should have another completed
side<00:04:31.540> along<00:04:32.540> with<00:04:32.810> your<00:04:33.140> yellow<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.770> black

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
side along with your yellow and black

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.810 
side along with your yellow and black
side<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.060> then<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:36.320> face<00:04:36.620> this<00:04:36.920> side<00:04:37.430> by

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
side and then you just face this side by

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.900 
side and then you just face this side by
side<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.660> solve<00:04:39.050> or<00:04:39.490> whatever<00:04:40.490> side<00:04:40.880> you

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
side that you solve or whatever side you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.580 
side that you solve or whatever side you
have<00:04:41.180> sold<00:04:42.580> all<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.900> do<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.080> I'll<00:04:45.350> go

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
have sold all and you do that I'll go

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.250 
have sold all and you do that I'll go
again<00:04:46.180> I'm<00:04:47.180> going<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.360> repeat<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:47.960> right

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
again I'm going to repeat it it's right

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.970 
again I'm going to repeat it it's right
and<00:04:48.470> brother<00:04:48.680> front<00:04:49.130> right<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.910> read<00:04:50.440> back<00:04:51.440> to

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
and brother front right and read back to

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.020 
and brother front right and read back to

wait for inverted right over to back to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.380 
wait for inverted right over to back to
our<00:04:56.420> two<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:58.220> then<00:04:58.400> your<00:04:58.610> cube<00:04:58.940> should<00:04:59.210> be

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
our two and then your cube should be

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.050 
our two and then your cube should be
