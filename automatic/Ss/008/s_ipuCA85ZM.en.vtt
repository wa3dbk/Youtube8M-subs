00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
bar right here is very crucial well let

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.649 
bar right here is very crucial well let
me<00:01:24.990> draw<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.740> straighter<00:01:26.659> because

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
me draw this a little straighter because

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.590 
me draw this a little straighter because
I'm<00:01:27.810> doing<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.140> freehand<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:29.070> here

the silver bugs

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.050 
the silver bugs
is<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:30.250> are<00:03:30.600> oversold<00:03:31.600> at<00:03:32.400> 6.35<00:03:33.400> percent

there<00:03:40.510> from<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.350> level<00:03:41.560> now<00:03:41.860> let's<00:03:42.250> take<00:03:42.460> a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
there from that level now let's take a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.760 
there from that level now let's take a
look<00:03:42.640> at<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.000> level<00:03:43.360> here<00:03:43.630> let's<00:03:44.260> take<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> look

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
look at the level here let's take a look

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.320 
look at the level here let's take a look
at<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.010> bottom<00:03:45.250> level<00:03:45.730> six<00:03:45.970> point<00:03:46.270> three

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
at that bottom level six point three

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.620 
at that bottom level six point three
five<00:03:46.540> percent<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.850> short-term<00:03:48.850> oversold

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
five percent and short-term oversold

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.870 
five percent and short-term oversold
gives<00:03:51.780> short<00:03:52.780> cover<00:03:53.080> rallies<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.950> great<00:03:54.370> entry

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
gives short cover rallies a great entry

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.270 
gives short cover rallies a great entry
and<00:03:55.090> an<00:03:55.630> exit<00:03:56.020> you're<00:03:56.440> not<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.770> a<00:03:56.830> bull<00:03:57.040> rally

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
and an exit you're not in a bull rally

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.800 
and an exit you're not in a bull rally
now<00:03:57.780> you're<00:03:58.780> you're<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.260> a<00:04:00.060> severe<00:04:01.060> bear

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
now you're you're in a severe bear

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.400 
now you're you're in a severe bear
reversal<00:04:02.760> however<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.360> will<00:04:04.630> get<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.170> the

reversal however you will get in the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.690 
reversal however you will get in the
shorter<00:04:05.800> term<00:04:05.830> so<00:04:06.250> their<00:04:06.400> short-term

don't have nearly the risk in standard
technical<00:06:11.410> analysis<00:06:12.040> is<00:06:12.190> when<00:06:12.490> something

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
technical analysis is when something

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.980 
technical analysis is when something
that's<00:06:13.000> closing<00:06:13.210> up<00:06:13.480> toward<00:06:13.720> the<00:06:13.810> high<00:06:13.930> the

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
that's closing up toward the high the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.450 
that's closing up toward the high the
day<00:06:14.380> so<00:06:15.280> if<00:06:15.580> we<00:06:16.150> break<00:06:16.390> that<00:06:16.630> trend<00:06:16.930> line<00:06:17.460> we're

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
day so if we break that trend line we're

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.770 
day so if we break that trend line we're
going<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.640> come<00:06:18.880> back<00:06:18.910> down<00:06:19.360> here<00:06:19.390> and<00:06:19.630> the

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
going to come back down here and the

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.630 
going to come back down here and the
green<00:06:20.020> line<00:06:20.230> was<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.470> 200-day<00:06:21.010> moving<00:06:21.190> average

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
green line was a 200-day moving average

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.150 
green line was a 200-day moving average
we're<00:06:22.180> short<00:06:22.540> sellers<00:06:22.960> had<00:06:23.170> such<00:06:23.410> a<00:06:23.440> big<00:06:23.860> move

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
we're short sellers had such a big move

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.150 
we're short sellers had such a big move
now<00:06:24.660> that<00:06:25.660> there<00:06:25.930> was<00:06:26.080> a<00:06:26.110> big<00:06:26.380> by<00:06:26.560> to<00:06:26.620> cover<00:06:26.920> so

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
now that there was a big by to cover so

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.740 
now that there was a big by to cover so
if<00:06:27.220> you're<00:06:27.370> shorten<00:06:27.790> up<00:06:27.850> here<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.300> you're

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
if you're shorten up here and you're

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.250 
if you're shorten up here and you're

they<00:06:35.350> held<00:06:35.560> it<00:06:35.740> down<00:06:35.880> what<00:06:36.880> happens<00:06:37.270> is<00:06:37.450> with

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
they held it down what happens is with

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.600 
they held it down what happens is with
the<00:06:38.020> public<00:06:38.470> is<00:06:38.590> it<00:06:38.740> gaps<00:06:38.950> down<00:06:39.250> the<00:06:39.370> first

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
the public is it gaps down the first

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.970 
the public is it gaps down the first
time<00:06:39.850> well<00:06:40.030> okay<00:06:40.330> it's<00:06:40.480> going<00:06:40.660> to<00:06:40.720> stop<00:06:40.980> that

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
time well okay it's going to stop that

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.190 
time well okay it's going to stop that
gaps<00:06:42.370> down<00:06:42.700> again<00:06:43.030> and<00:06:43.060> it<00:06:43.300> doesn't<00:06:43.720> stop<00:06:43.810> and

gaps down again and it doesn't stop and
then<00:06:44.290> they<00:06:44.380> think<00:06:44.620> well<00:06:44.800> it's<00:06:44.920> going<00:06:45.130> to

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
then they think well it's going to

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.190 
then they think well it's going to
bounce<00:06:45.310> like<00:06:45.700> it<00:06:45.850> should<00:06:46.090> but<00:06:46.660> the<00:06:46.840> 10<00:06:47.050> day
