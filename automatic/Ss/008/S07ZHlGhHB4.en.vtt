and<00:01:53.420> just<00:01:53.690> mixing<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.440> up<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.800> then<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.100> way<00:01:55.190> I

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
and just mixing it up and then the way I

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.210 
and just mixing it up and then the way I
like<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.780> measure<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.110> or<00:01:57.350> get<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.830> patties

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
like to measure it or get the patties

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.320 
like to measure it or get the patties
right<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:58.460> actually<00:01:58.760> just<00:01:58.850> put<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.150> whole

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
right is actually just put the whole

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.360 
right is actually just put the whole
thing<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.720> scale<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.350> then<00:02:00.920> turn<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.250> on

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
thing on the scale and then turn it on

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.420 
thing on the scale and then turn it on
and<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.900> call<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.410> backwards<00:02:04.040> way<00:02:04.190> I'm

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
and I just I I call it backwards way I'm

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.430 
and I just I I call it backwards way I'm
sure<00:02:04.580> there's<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.820> more<00:02:05.030> official<00:02:05.390> term<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:06.260> do

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
sure there's a more official term to do

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.770 
sure there's a more official term to do
that<00:02:06.650> but<00:02:07.010> so<00:02:07.730> I<00:02:07.760> put<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.000> on<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.270> scale<00:02:08.540> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
that but so I put it on the scale and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
that but so I put it on the scale and
then<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:09.200> take<00:02:09.500> off<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.770> little<00:02:10.010> bit<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.520> it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
then just take off a little bit and it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.660 
then just take off a little bit and it
deducts<00:02:10.880> two<00:02:11.780> ounces<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.710> just<00:02:13.220> fall<00:02:13.520> them

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
deducts two ounces so I just fall them

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.050 
deducts two ounces so I just fall them
up<00:02:13.820> make<00:02:14.210> them<00:02:14.240> into<00:02:14.540> little<00:02:14.570> patties<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
up make them into little patties and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.660 
up make them into little patties and
then<00:02:17.300> that's<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.480> again<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.670> measure

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
then that's it so again I just measure

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.160 
then that's it so again I just measure
out<00:02:22.940> about<00:02:22.970> two<00:02:23.480> ounces<00:02:24.040> fall<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:26.170> make

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
out about two ounces fall it up make

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.580 
out about two ounces fall it up make
little<00:02:27.560> patties<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.480> that's<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.110> do<00:02:33.260> so

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
little patties and that's all you do so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.950 
little patties and that's all you do so
I<00:02:33.620> made<00:02:34.010> go<00:02:34.640> ahead<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.000> make<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.210> patties<00:02:35.600> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
I made go ahead and make the patties and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.350 
I made go ahead and make the patties and
as<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.410> hit<00:02:36.710> green<00:02:37.010> or<00:02:37.220> free<00:02:37.520> me<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.790> be<00:02:37.940> skillet

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
as it hit green or free me to be skillet

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.750 
as it hit green or free me to be skillet
to<00:02:38.840> medium<00:02:39.230> heat<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.130> reason<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.520> doing<00:02:40.580> that

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
to medium heat the reason for doing that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.520 
to medium heat the reason for doing that
is<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.210> cooks<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.930> cooks<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.350> meat

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
is this cooks up this cooks the meat

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.020 
is this cooks up this cooks the meat
better<00:02:42.680> because<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.310> such<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.520> lean<00:02:43.820> meat

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
better because it is such a lean meat

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.070 
better because it is such a lean meat
you<00:02:44.150> don't<00:02:44.180> want<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.480> cook<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.750> too<00:02:44.780> fast

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
you don't want to cook it too fast

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.960 
you don't want to cook it too fast
because<00:02:45.470> don't<00:02:45.650> dry<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.950> out<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.400> make<00:02:46.880> it

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
because don't dry it out and make it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.000 
because don't dry it out and make it
really<00:02:47.150> tough<00:02:47.450> I'm<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.170> cooking<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.740> medium

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
really tough I'm so cooking it on medium

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.940 
really tough I'm so cooking it on medium
heat<00:02:49.489> watching<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.150> really<00:02:50.390> closely

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
heat watching it really closely

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.500 
heat watching it really closely
throughout<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.130> cooking<00:02:52.250> process<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.940> found

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
throughout the cooking process I found

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.360 
throughout the cooking process I found
is<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:53.750> better<00:02:54.110> especially<00:02:54.410> into<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.100> mid

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
is just better especially into the mid

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.590 
is just better especially into the mid
with<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> lot<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.910> saving<00:02:56.209> bulk

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
with a lot of saving bulk

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.810 
with a lot of saving bulk
it<00:02:57.020> also<00:02:57.260> stores<00:02:57.830> better<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.340> way<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.670> it

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
it also stores better that way and it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.699 
it also stores better that way and it
still<00:02:59.120> continues<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.720> be<00:02:59.750> moist<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.320> after

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
still continues to be moist and after

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.520 
still continues to be moist and after
you<00:03:00.830> reheat<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.370> when<00:03:02.030> you're<00:03:02.690> cooking<00:03:03.260> your

important to make it on lower heat I

mean that make sure you overcook it you

mean that make sure you overcook it you
don't

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
don't

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
important things when you're using this

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.590 
important things when you're using this
piece<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.580> could<00:03:18.820> get<00:03:18.970> between<00:03:19.300> two<00:03:19.450> and

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
piece so I could get between two and

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.880 
piece so I could get between two and
three<00:03:19.660> minutes<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.200> each<00:03:20.350> side

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
of depending on what it looks like that

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.050 
of depending on what it looks like that
day<00:03:25.540> but<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.050> also<00:03:26.230> then<00:03:26.650> will<00:03:26.860> let<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.490> cool<00:03:27.700> up

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
day but I also then will let it cool up

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.480 
day but I also then will let it cool up
before<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:28.990> put<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.770> refrigerator<00:03:30.220> I

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
before I put it in the refrigerator I

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.820 
before I put it in the refrigerator I
said<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.060> keeps<00:03:31.600> all<00:03:31.780> those<00:03:31.990> juices<00:03:32.380> in<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.770> I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
said it keeps all those juices in and I
