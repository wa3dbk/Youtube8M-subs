00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.099
 then a muscular scale like his 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 name indicated it is a break of the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
 muscle here in an accident then 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.870
 of an accident that is rather the fact 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.170
 with a violent gesture 1 for example one can 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.170
 to make a tear of the quadriceps on 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.560
 muscle of the thigh when one makes a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.320
 shoot a very violent shoot this is a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 lesions of the footballer one can get 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 to make a tear of the muscles ischio 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 leg muscles it's the muscles are behind 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 thigh 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 it is rather a pathology of the sprinter 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.160
 during a very fast race and well at 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 moment of muscle should be left 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 is pulled he does not let himself be stretched and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 breakage can occur 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.500
 it is a rupture of the muscular fibers 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.039
 we can not miss it because the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 pain is violent when she 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 happens so that's the symptom is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.219
 essential 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.770
 and then the one of a second is that just 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.780
 after this very important pain the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.339
 movement is no longer possible so if 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.950
 it's a tear for example of a 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.200
 muscle of a lower limb and well the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.070
 no one is going to have to mud been see 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.170
 to lean on someone's shoulder 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.090
 so the two major signs are a 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.229
 very strong initial pain and then this 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.670
 what is called impotence 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.490
 functional ie a 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.310
 inability to achieve the movements that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.119
 would be generated by this injured muscle 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.400
 first there are things not to do 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.060
 and one thing to do is mass and 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.680
 this important pain so who is the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.119
 consequence of the tear why not 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.369
 not to amass because a tear is 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.070
 like a sore so if you handle 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.990
 you can spread the banks of the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.520
 sore and then the second reason it's 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.229
 that when you have a tear often 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.960
 this bleeds a hematoma can be 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.190
 build up and massaged a hematoma is not 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.410
 not without risks it can lead 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.780
 So sometimes calcifications 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.340
 consultation consultation of a doctor 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.970
 of your GP or a doctor 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.880
 sports doctor 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.970
 this doctor will make the diagnosis in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.430
 looking at you eventually but that's 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.989
 not necessarily an obligation he you 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.660
 will propose additional examinations 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.100
 to better specify the location and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.010
 the extent of the injury 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.790
 these additional exams are the most 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.750
 often an ultrasound see a irm the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.690
 word tear is a word that means in 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.550
 a significant injury 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.040
 the word breakdown 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.210
 which also corresponds to breaks 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.190
 of 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.750
 of muscle fibers corresponds to 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.290
 less important lesions so everything 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.060
 depends on the importance of the lesions a 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.010
 Muscle injury can heal 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.810
 between one week and two months 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.800
 that's most of the time let's count 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 rather between three and six weeks and 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 what you need to know is that there is 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.020
 four moments if we want to be very 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.720
 pointed in the treatment of this 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.730
 muscle injury there is a prime 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.180
 treatment which is the treatment 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.970
 immediate 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.080
 it's the first day to see the second 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:12.240
 or the third the frosting to avoid 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.820
 bleeding too much the rest 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 the elevation of the leg for also 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.280
 drained a hematoma that would have 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.140
 consisting 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.780
 and then possibly a contention 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.730
 so surrounded the muscle of a band 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.200
 elastic for example here too for 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.020
 avoid bleeding that's it 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.210
 the Greek acronym grc icing rest 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.510
 contention elevation which are the 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.950
 first phase of this treatment 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.590
 then a second phase after 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.840
 a few days could constitute in 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.780
 a mobilization of this very soft muscle 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.730
 even relaxation without movement 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.280
 simply because the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.100
 muscle mobilization at the beginning of his 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.500
 healing will allow the best 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.410
 modeling of this scar is so 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.180
 will accompany healing 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.800
 a third phase that will succeed the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.480
 second so there too according to the 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.550
 gravity this third phase will arrive 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.980
 after 15 days or three weeks and 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.739
 it will be good to start again 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.510
 remuscler get muscle and then the muscles 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.579
 from a periphery who did not work 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.260
 who will have to re-prepare and 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.329
 to the efforts you are going to ask him 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.090
 and then the fourth phase is fine 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.790
 it's starting to do the gesture again 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.320
 sporty who is your pleasure 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.210
 this is called the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.400
 reathlisation ended up being the 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.290
 muscular ability of the skill of 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.169
 this muscle in a sportsman's request 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.060
 zero risk does not exist so and all 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.300
 the best prepared champions have 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.770
 also been or are not enough have not 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.150
 often but in any case are victims 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.910
 muscle damage 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.830
 we say that the best way to avoid the 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.270
 muscle injury is to have a 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.919
 good physical condition 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.990
 the muscular addition is going rather 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.490
 appear during fatigue so 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.140
 when one has gone beyond one's 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.370
 capacity 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.640
 muscle injury may appear 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.860
 also if we have a bad balance between 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.600
 our muscles 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.690
 each muscle does not work in isolation 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.010
 if you take for example the muscle of 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.590
 the thigh at the quadriceps which is a 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.419
 muscle that extends the legs that allows 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.550
 the race is this muscle of 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.050
 controlled by the opposing muscle that is 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.000
 behind called the ischio 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.800
 legs and who control the action of the 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.860
 first you have to have a good balance 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.190
 of balance of power between his muscles 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.930
 that we say agonist and antagonists 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.820
 good physical condition a good 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.800
 muscular ability to a good balance 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.490
 muscle is the best weapon of 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.229
 this prevention 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.880
 and then the technical gesture as well 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.830
 sure plays a role when we play sports 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.039
 a technical defect is always 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.039
 risk
