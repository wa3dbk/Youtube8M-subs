00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
make sure to take a piece that it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.410 
make sure to take a piece that it's
slightly<00:01:03.949> larger<00:01:04.460> than<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.879> paper<00:01:05.089> plate

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
slightly larger than the paper plate

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.859 
slightly larger than the paper plate
this<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.619> much<00:01:06.920> fun

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
this is so much fun

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.050 
this is so much fun
then<00:01:08.869> take<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.380> water<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.979> mix<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.790> with<00:01:11.000> a

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
then take the water and mix it with a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.780 
then take the water and mix it with a
white<00:01:11.299> craft<00:01:11.689> glue<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.710> should<00:01:13.070> be<00:01:13.220> about<00:01:13.549> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
white craft glue it should be about the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.390 
white craft glue it should be about the
same<00:01:14.000> amount<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.570> water<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.590> glue<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.220> that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
same amount of water as of glue so that

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000 
same amount of water as of glue so that
the<00:01:16.490> glue<00:01:16.700> becomes<00:01:16.909> fluent<00:01:17.600> yep<00:01:18.170> mix<00:01:18.799> together

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
the glue becomes fluent yep mix together

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.580 
the glue becomes fluent yep mix together
this<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.060> going<00:01:20.090> smoothly<00:01:22.840> then<00:01:23.840> brush<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.350> thin

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
this is going smoothly then brush a thin

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.469 
this is going smoothly then brush a thin
layer<00:01:24.799> on<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.400> back<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.880> paper<00:01:26.060> plate

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
layer on the back of the paper plate

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.219 
layer on the back of the paper plate
like<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:29.000> glue<00:01:29.390> glue<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:31.009> glue<00:01:31.400> glue<00:01:32.229> be

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
like this you glue glue you glue glue be

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.959 
like this you glue glue you glue glue be
careful<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:33.920> don't<00:01:34.009> end<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:34.670> loop

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.770 

put<00:01:37.969> down<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.299> tissue<00:01:38.509> paper<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.200> Stroke<00:01:39.740> it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
put down the tissue paper and Stroke it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.239 
put down the tissue paper and Stroke it
brush<00:01:41.780> even<00:01:42.109> more<00:01:42.320> glue<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:42.740> top<00:01:42.979> of<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
brush even more glue on top of the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.550 
brush even more glue on top of the
tissue<00:01:43.460> paper<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.420> sticks<00:01:44.749> firmly<00:01:45.109> on<00:01:45.439> the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
tissue paper so it sticks firmly on the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.819 
tissue paper so it sticks firmly on the
plate<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.069> becomes<00:01:46.609> quite<00:01:46.999> plain<00:01:47.329> neat<00:01:48.259> if

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
plate and becomes quite plain neat if

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.800 
plate and becomes quite plain neat if
the<00:01:48.890> tissue<00:01:49.310> paper<00:01:49.429> is<00:01:49.939> bursting<00:01:50.390> somewhere

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
the tissue paper is bursting somewhere

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.899 
the tissue paper is bursting somewhere
just<00:01:51.109> put<00:01:51.439> a<00:01:51.469> small<00:01:51.859> new<00:01:52.130> piece<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.700> tissue

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
just put a small new piece of tissue

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.209 
just put a small new piece of tissue
paper<00:01:53.060> over<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.990> hole<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.380> brush<00:01:54.770> some<00:01:55.009> blue

like this it looks fantastic now we make
a<00:02:14.480> nice<00:02:14.780> pattern<00:02:15.110> on<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.530> top<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> plate

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
a nice pattern on the top of the plate

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.120 
a nice pattern on the top of the plate
woah

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
woah

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.680 
woah
choose<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> tissue<00:02:19.520> paper<00:02:19.880> in<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.270> different

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
choose a tissue paper in a different

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.540 
choose a tissue paper in a different
color<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.340> cut<00:02:22.340> off<00:02:22.550> wide<00:02:22.880> stripes<00:02:23.480> oh

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
color and cut off wide stripes oh

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.070 
color and cut off wide stripes oh
there's<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.790> scissors<00:02:26.240> again<00:02:26.630> something

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
there's the scissors again something

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.020 
there's the scissors again something
like<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:29.710> then<00:02:30.710> cut<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> strip<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.550> pieces

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
like this then cut the strip in pieces

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.450 
like this then cut the strip in pieces
like<00:02:32.450> this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
like this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.190 
like this
careful<00:02:34.460> now<00:02:34.670> then<00:02:35.090> change<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.630> angle<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
careful now then change the angle of the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.600 
careful now then change the angle of the
scissors<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.710> make<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.100> next<00:02:37.400> cut

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
scissors and make the next cut

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.900 
scissors and make the next cut
diagonally<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.390> other<00:02:38.510> way<00:02:38.720> katkat<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:40.760> you

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
diagonally the other way katkat then you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.820 
diagonally the other way katkat then you
get<00:02:41.090> these<00:02:41.300> kinds<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.870> pointy<00:02:42.350> tips<00:02:42.590> or

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
get these kinds of pointy tips or

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.270 
get these kinds of pointy tips or
triangles<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.720> here<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.410> usually<00:02:45.920> means<00:02:46.070> a

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
triangles so here it usually means a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.350 
triangles so here it usually means a
