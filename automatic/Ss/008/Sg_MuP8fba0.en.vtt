00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
can see the plot the black is the

both make a very good combination and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.460 
both make a very good combination and
how<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.029> works<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.810> reason<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.140> making<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
how this works the reason I making this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
how this works the reason I making this
video<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.300> there<00:00:24.300> were<00:00:24.449> no<00:00:24.750> videos

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
video is because there were no videos

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.540 
video is because there were no videos
online<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.760> case<00:00:27.260> that<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.320> could<00:00:28.529> find<00:00:28.710> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
online of this case that I could find so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.470 
online of this case that I could find so
I<00:00:29.580> decided<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.779> ordered<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:31.769> offline

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
I decided to do is I ordered one offline

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.780 
I decided to do is I ordered one offline
because<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.780> fits<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.079> phone<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:35.040> cool<00:00:35.370> case

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

taped no instructions at all so after
tinkering<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> long<00:00:49.649> time<00:00:49.710> you

what fit I even tried taking this part
out<00:00:58.039> fitting<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.100> over<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.989> you<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.109> this

part<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:02.850> promising<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
part was on it was promising because you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
part was on it was promising because you
know<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.860> worked<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.640> unlike

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
know it actually worked at first unlike

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.010 
know it actually worked at first unlike
my<00:01:06.570> other<00:01:06.600> failed<00:01:07.170> attempts<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:08.640> um<00:01:09.020> sadly

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
my other failed attempts but um sadly

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
my other failed attempts but um sadly
enough<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> end<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> still<00:01:11.159> did<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:11.340> work

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
enough in the end it still did not work

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.820 
enough in the end it still did not work
it<00:01:11.850> made<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.060> even<00:01:12.150> harder<00:01:12.439> well<00:01:13.439> after<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it made it even harder well after a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
it made it even harder well after a
little<00:01:13.950> while<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.549> saw<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.659> splitting

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
little while I saw that it was splitting

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
little while I saw that it was splitting
in<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.979> region<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> see

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in that region I don't know if you see

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.320 
in that region I don't know if you see
that<00:01:18.299> very<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.990> uh<00:01:19.250> yeah<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.939> first

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that very well but uh yeah my first

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
that very well but uh yeah my first
thought<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.960> broke<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.549> like

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
thought is I broke it and it was like

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.390 
thought is I broke it and it was like
the<00:01:23.790> first<00:01:23.909> 10<00:01:24.180> minutes<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> having<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
the first 10 minutes of having it well I

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
the first 10 minutes of having it well I
figured<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.549> no<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.509> most<00:01:27.780> cases<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
figured out that no like most cases that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.050 
figured out that no like most cases that
I<00:01:28.920> had<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.310> been<00:01:29.549> around<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.869> uh<00:01:31.790> just<00:01:32.790> pop

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I had not been around to see uh just pop

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.530 
I had not been around to see uh just pop
on<00:01:33.350> like<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.509> I<00:01:36.509> thought<00:01:37.170> fail<00:01:37.650> well<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
on like that and I thought fail well I

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.760 
on like that and I thought fail well I
finally<00:01:39.540> figure<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.500> didn't

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
finally figure it out and then it didn't

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.370 
finally figure it out and then it didn't
take<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.369> effort<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.790> figure<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> out

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
take a bit of effort to figure it out

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.789 
take a bit of effort to figure it out
you<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.619> lay<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.590> fits

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
you just lay it in there like so it fits

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.999 
you just lay it in there like so it fits
perfectly<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.530> now<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.860> are<00:01:49.890> two

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
perfectly then this now there are two

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
perfectly then this now there are two
parts<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.909> notches<00:01:51.149> at<00:01:51.420> top<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.439> could

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
parts with notches at top and it could

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
parts with notches at top and it could
get<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.860> disorienting<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.509> for

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
get a little disorienting just look for

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.819 
get a little disorienting just look for
the<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.899> notch<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:57.000> notch<00:01:57.380> if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.560> close

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the one notch and one notch if you close

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.700 
the one notch and one notch if you close
it<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.310> and<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.960> pops<00:02:01.259> off<00:02:01.409> very

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it on there and it pops off very

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.569 
it on there and it pops off very
securely<00:02:02.899> makes<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> very<00:02:04.140> good<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:05.310> takes<00:02:05.490> a
