00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.769
 last steam emission 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 a cell phone that is characterized by being 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.210
 clearly compact however having a keyboard that olic I expect a trasunto 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.359
 of the accessible mind and the sd specification 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.789
 thanks to a little lower than what we found four children as well as 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.920
 promote the box because what we have is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.630
 Black color leaves the ticket sideways but the one that supports most of the other 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.979
 thing more than the force of destiny 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.700
 12 6% 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 if we open the box 3 this device two parts 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.450
 pretty smart osvaldo let's do both 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.840

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 we have here in st 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 wall charger there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.490
 apparently these from the chargers that 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.950
 josÃ© carlos bermejo 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.790
 in fact the chargers that issued adapted do not hook the connection to 15 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.710
 says connect villamil phone portal rowing clubs apparently 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 four and is now using more micro then according to the tastes 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.220
 one side here we have an adapter of some by products are third 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.590
 efe if we want to be us the communists of Cuba 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 this phone in the English version 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.210
 this collector and we have the walker for the americas 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 we want hearing aids 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 these hearing aids are apparently components 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 of 3 points 5 millimeters holy sunday 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 and well and we have a vcd cable 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.910
 with equal conviction and air force 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.100
 we have a battery 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 just that same battery they found for the previous cup 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.070
 i synergy millions of dollars thousand 110 grams which 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.800
 with the hope of life to defend with order and efficiency 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.109
 one would believe that after many problems with this 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.109
 here is our more than 6% 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.279
 let's see who we have this activity 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.279
 the irs apparently a fast track 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.829
 let's see signs of a quick guide of what we can for less 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.269
 we have dengue 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.269
 Four daughters seeks to sensitize to synchronization 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.999
 the exclusive invitation 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.629
 to know 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.809
 silvano aureoles banque 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.819
 we must register 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.859
 and we have the user manual 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.309
 and let's see 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.309
 apparently some of the images 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.259
 we have the boxes 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.259
 those that come within the content 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.859
 pretty pretty small pretty smart I love him 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.309
 keyboard design a little different drivers are now 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.869
 p different to what we found an earlier act and apparently it is the 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.929
 first cross that comes with with this office for the prefect to take that 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.919
 extra and previously 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.049
 famous for red 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.969
 the article that refers that apparently slow progress 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.599
 it's just as long but 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.599
 let's see is a bit harder it's actually almost the same 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.239
 in case we compare it against the clear epa and that is another cell phone with 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.019
 those who compete the aipac is definitely not longer 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.169
 definitely older of course like 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.859
 if we are going to see with processes go behind these movements 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:53.329
 definitely after long address times in some more serious cases I do not 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.139
 I have to tell you 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.859
 just compare the opposite 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.009
 motorola Jun 9 h I apologize but this is one of the most phones 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:02.359
 used 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.099
 however other states actually longer but more comfortable 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.329
 we hope to arrive at the afp 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.089
 motorola city with nine days was another 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.529
 of the proposals of the experts 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.039
 the popular of the percent percent compared to products and 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.579
 definitely the law 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.579
 patriotic all a little bit longer 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.280
 they were practically as first part we have seen the contents of the box 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.930
 quite complete that it houses even though it does not include any class 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.040
 leather shorts or something but what are we going to do have other ways 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.810
 so far the first two thirds of the French pretty 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.009
 pretty pretty warm 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.869
 Maybe it's maybe I feel a little loose in the back 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.970
 today losses something characteristic of the area where any doubt they have 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.139
 they can leave a comment the cost in the same way they were together 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.020
 with they saw before playing in first since I finished the first part the 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.560
 next let's see a little of what has jure john phones thank you
