00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:02.059 
me or I didn't find them until just
until<00:02:54.040> after<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.610> video<00:02:57.269> let's<00:02:58.269> see<00:02:58.600> they<00:02:59.290> are

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.530 

pokemon<00:03:03.069> leaf<00:03:03.340> green<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.829> sake<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.860> smash<00:03:06.310> pack

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.000 

if<00:03:10.540> they<00:03:10.780> were<00:03:10.870> gonna<00:03:11.019> really<00:03:11.230> say<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> smash

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
pack which has Sonic Spinball on it so I

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.750
