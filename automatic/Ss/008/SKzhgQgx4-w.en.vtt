00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Welcome to the first couple of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.470
 series call of duty codes explains this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.330
 let's explain the mode of domination 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 Years is now the same as in 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
 none of the old cryptic title 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 Innovations are the same as always 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 just now without a page change 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.010
 Just finish playing the minutes 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 district 200 points without page change 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 unfortunately now says ten minutes 15 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 Just a minute, balance can be reached 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880
 I decide mine 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.289
 perfect written down and in black 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.730
 ops 2 that they have very clear 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.219
 page change made to stop 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 a bit competitive to bring in that 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.850
 whole because that's what you have today 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 page change but that has quite like 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.989
 not so complete because yes 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.550
 just then in the second round he will 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.110
 the best way had already been there 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.149
 daniel lightning and everything out of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.489
 could and so actually our man for 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.920
 could decide and therefore has to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.289
 you look like this is going to be on now 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.469
 cottbus if you can do it now anyway 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.289
 it could be a bit flat, for example 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.049
 because of the abos or filter in the 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.510
 traffic so in control and look 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 now comes or happy so far 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.630
 we you have the second one again 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.549
 search destroy play the same today 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 cool is like normally now 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 that leads with the two halves so indeed 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.090
 already very cool and that's a pity 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 and what's too bad is black 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 ops 2 at the two round system that you 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.400
 that's just what it's for, for example 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 half of the second round 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.380
 Can calculate it as our time and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.850
 they already have so many points that can 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.750
 no one can stop and at the same time 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 quits or so theoretically 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 and there it can already calculate if that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.450
 game can also be rotated or 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 Not so and it is a pity that you 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.520
 can not keep up with any innovation as 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.860
 mountain has been perfect when at 100 100 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.640
 points would be page switching and then too 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.820
 play the end 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 that would be phenomenal really ultra 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.329
 super duper mega super extreme I pull 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.219
 that wanted longer horny and writes in 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.799

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.730
 get out my name is caps and la la la 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:11.510
