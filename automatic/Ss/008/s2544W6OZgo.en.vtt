00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.860
 Spartak Zenith match fans were waiting 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.010
 long today you could watch the subway 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.340
 lots of scarf fans all day 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.389
 tribune today it was confirmed for the match 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.780
 it's about fifty thousand 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.070
 viewers and this energy could not 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.580
 not affect the game that as a result 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.679
 happened 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.189
 such a game what Spartak showed 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.229
 fans of red white roses today 

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.640
 waited a long time on such a zenith Spartak 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.739
 responded with two or even three attacks which 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.309
 were certainly no less acute excellent 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:33.070
 moments were help the judges niki studies and in 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 madrid can generally be safely recognized 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.370
 one of the best players of the first half 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.769
 despite the fact that as a result 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.740
 Spartak scored by opening an account 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.920
 I think even the fans at the zenith will agree 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 what a high performance goal 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.970
 P 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.120
 scoring goal Spartak continued 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.100
 dominate 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 however, he is aware 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.730
 win back 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.880
 running to the counterattack on the 39th minute 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.890
 initiative on the gates of dikan equalized 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.850
 after three minutes an event occurred 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.040
 which is still long to be discussed 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.380
 Suslov match between Spartak and Zenith 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.150
 calling some kind of scandal possible 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 remember the situation with the Americans 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.230
 many other things for us 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.720
 judicial decisions will be discussed 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.370
 sure semenko 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.570
 Nicolas parehu for pushing his face 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 from the Cossacks 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 for business 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 the second half for the red and white began 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.820
 off goal dikan 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.760
 after shooting through the wide 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.500
 rod locked korzhakov 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.710
 what is interesting right after the break 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.180
 field splashed appeared 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.940
 she is understandable given that the other 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.660
 center back has already been removed 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.760
 began the third minute Akopyan decided 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.940
 remove from the field splasgalov however with 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.920
 another replacement carpina come 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.479
 really guessed bark Spartak 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.189
 won back made the score 2 2 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.349
 percent limit tons hit gate 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.959
 after shooting from the flank in the performance 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.959
 magic 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.859
 so the teams went peacefully 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.719
 and after the match was over 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.299
 talk they are all twice champion 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.149
 Spartacus owners said that during 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:32.889
 quarantine such judging which 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.469
 It was today performed by Kazmenko 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.539
 but somehow the scheme is 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.039
 Spartak and zenith will always be that 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.359
 to discuss 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.359
 I would like to win 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.010
 the picture turned out dollars 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.010
 first precedent and last 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.839
 many issues 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.939
 on Tuesday
