I'm a little bit afraid to step off of
these<00:02:37.080> logs<00:02:37.410> because<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.160> thing<00:02:38.430> probably

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
these logs because this thing probably

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.170 
these logs because this thing probably
not<00:02:39.810> too<00:02:40.140> good<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.470> humans<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.610> next<00:02:42.000> of

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
not too good for humans the next of

not too good for humans the next of
these<00:02:42.360> buckets<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.530> toxic<00:02:44.130> bucket<00:02:44.520> now

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
deadliest bucket because it is basically

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.740 
deadliest bucket because it is basically
like<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.590> tsunami<00:02:49.950> except<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:51.060> poisonous
