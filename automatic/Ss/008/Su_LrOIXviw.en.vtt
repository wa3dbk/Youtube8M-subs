obviously you want to make sure that

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260 
obviously you want to make sure that
your<00:00:17.380> printer<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.860> this<00:00:18.010> is<00:00:18.190> I'm<00:00:18.370> gonna<00:00:18.520> just

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
your printer and this is I'm gonna just

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.120 
your printer and this is I'm gonna just
to<00:00:19.390> cut<00:00:19.540> off<00:00:19.600> I'm<00:00:19.840> dealing<00:00:20.200> with<00:00:20.230> printers

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
to cut off I'm dealing with printers

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.440 
to cut off I'm dealing with printers
that<00:00:21.280> are<00:00:21.370> connected<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:21.820> your<00:00:21.880> local<00:00:22.090> system

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
that are connected to your local system

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.840 
that are connected to your local system
by<00:00:22.720> some<00:00:22.930> like<00:00:23.050> USB<00:00:23.410> okay<00:00:24.340> I'm<00:00:24.640> not<00:00:24.730> talking

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
by some like USB okay I'm not talking

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.010 
by some like USB okay I'm not talking
bout<00:00:25.000> network<00:00:25.270> printers<00:00:25.510> network<00:00:25.780> printers

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
bout network printers network printers

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.420 
bout network printers network printers
adds<00:00:26.260> a<00:00:26.380> whole<00:00:26.530> other<00:00:26.710> layer<00:00:26.920> of<00:00:26.980> complexity

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
adds a whole other layer of complexity

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.860 
adds a whole other layer of complexity
because<00:00:27.610> you<00:00:27.850> have<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.600> thought<00:00:28.720> about

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870 
because you have to thought about

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.170 
because you have to thought about
debugging<00:00:29.110> network<00:00:29.650> problems<00:00:30.070> or<00:00:30.430> potential

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
debugging network problems or potential

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.429 
debugging network problems or potential
Network<00:00:31.420> problems<00:00:31.690> so<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.110> first<00:00:32.289> thing<00:00:32.379> you

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
Network problems so the first thing you

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.750 
Network problems so the first thing you
want<00:00:32.559> to<00:00:32.589> do<00:00:32.710> is<00:00:32.920> first<00:00:33.159> off<00:00:33.339> you<00:00:33.550> want<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.699> make

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
want to do is first off you want to make

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.799 
want to do is first off you want to make
sure<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.089> your<00:00:34.239> printer<00:00:34.359> is<00:00:34.539> actually

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
sure that your printer is actually

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.040 
sure that your printer is actually
plugged<00:00:34.929> into<00:00:35.109> the<00:00:35.320> USB<00:00:35.559> into<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.100> USB<00:00:36.370> port<00:00:36.670> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
plugged into the USB into a USB port and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.590 
plugged into the USB into a USB port and
on<00:00:38.050> your<00:00:38.230> computer<00:00:38.319> and<00:00:38.829> it's<00:00:39.159> also<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:40.239> plug

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
on your computer and it's also the plug

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.239 
on your computer and it's also the plug
is<00:00:40.780> securely<00:00:41.109> plugged<00:00:41.409> into<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.980> printer

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.249 
is securely plugged into the printer

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:43.040 
is securely plugged into the printer
itself

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
itself

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.200 
itself
assuming<00:00:44.050> that's<00:00:44.109> the<00:00:44.289> case<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.789> want<00:00:46.030> to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
assuming that's the case you want to

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.610 
assuming that's the case you want to
then<00:00:46.390> try<00:00:46.870> cycling<00:00:47.679> the<00:00:47.769> printer<00:00:48.039> on<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.370> off

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
then try cycling the printer on and off

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520 
then try cycling the printer on and off
and<00:00:50.620> see<00:00:50.739> if<00:00:50.769> that<00:00:51.010> fixes<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.550> issue<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:53.409> next

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
and see if that fixes the issue the next

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.799 
and see if that fixes the issue the next
thing<00:00:53.739> you'd<00:00:53.859> want<00:00:54.069> to<00:00:54.129> try<00:00:54.339> is<00:00:54.670> if<00:00:55.569> your

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
thing you'd want to try is if your

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.389 
thing you'd want to try is if your
printer<00:00:55.929> is<00:00:56.170> plugged<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.769> say<00:00:56.920> that's<00:00:57.100> it

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
printer is plugged in to say that's it

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.279 
printer is plugged in to say that's it
like<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.760> USB<00:00:58.299> hub<00:00:58.449> or<00:00:58.629> something<00:00:58.809> like<00:00:58.870> that

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
like a USB hub or something like that

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.160 
like a USB hub or something like that
try<00:00:59.769> plugging<00:01:00.039> it<00:01:00.339> in<00:01:00.489> directly<00:01:01.089> rather<00:01:01.989> than

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
try plugging it in directly rather than

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
try plugging it in directly rather than
indirectly<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.190> see<00:01:03.429> if<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:03.670> works

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
indirectly and see if that works

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.030 
indirectly and see if that works
you<00:01:06.640> also<00:01:06.820> want<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.150> go<00:01:07.540> up<00:01:07.840> into<00:01:08.110> go<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.890> the

recognizing<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.210> for<00:01:37.570> some<00:01:37.750> reason<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.950> now

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
recognizing it for some reason so now

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.470 
recognizing it for some reason so now
that's<00:01:39.280> one<00:01:39.490> possibility<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.240> other

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
that's one possibility and other

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.940 
that's one possibility and other
possibility<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.350> may<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.500> something

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
possibility is you may have something

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.550 
possibility is you may have something
jammed<00:01:42.160> up<00:01:42.370> in<00:01:42.490> your<00:01:42.610> queue<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:44.110> fix<00:01:44.290> either

then turning your printer back on

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.880 
then turning your printer back on
that<00:02:00.370> can<00:02:00.520> sometimes<00:02:00.700> clear<00:02:01.060> things<00:02:01.300> out

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that can sometimes clear things out

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610 
that can sometimes clear things out
assuming<00:02:02.890> all<00:02:03.070> of<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.340> fails<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.470> can

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
assuming all of that fails what you can

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.940 
assuming all of that fails what you can
do<00:02:05.710> here<00:02:06.040> is<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.400> can<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:07.990> your<00:02:08.319> system

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
do here is you can go to your system

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.930 
do here is you can go to your system
preferences<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.460> then<00:02:10.240> print<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.630> fax

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
preferences and then print and fax

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.990 
preferences and then print and fax
and<00:02:12.680> first<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.250> open<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.700> print

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and first off you can open up the print

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
and first off you can open up the print
queue<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.380> see<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.680> there's<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.890> job
