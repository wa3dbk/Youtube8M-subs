00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.599
 hello welcome to this video where 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.700
 let's learn the basics in 

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:09.740
 crochet therefore is a bit 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.050
 dedicated to those people that maybe 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.750
 want to enter the world of 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.640
 crochet but they still do not have 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.619
 no previous idea is worth 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.980
 then the only thing we're going to need 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.440
 is the thread that we have chosen and our 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.029
 crochet the hooks carry a 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.680
 numbering that usually go a little bit 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.770
 according to the numbering that usually 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.170
 bring the yarn and wool the thread that 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.819
 we are using the numbers the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.870
 I do not really handle it, I just see 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:41.300
 let my crochet hook the thread 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.710
 what am I using so that what 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.749
 you see well I will use a thread a 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.479
 little chubby that is a knit yarn 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.769
 cross then I think that being so a 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.799
 little to chubby you are going to be able to see it 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.989
 better good what we will do is 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.329
 call chain and is the basics that we go 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.549
 to need to start any other 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.379
 kind of point then to learn 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.180
 some more thing we're going to need 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.630
 first yes or yes 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.130
 this kind of start this chain as 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.140
 we 're going to start it good by doing the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.630
 world with the crochet is worth a knot 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.790
 simply the yarn if not very with the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.290
 crochet how are we going to do good I 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.960
 I'm going to teach you the way that for me 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.720
 it's easier we're going to catch the thread 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.880
 this way we are going to hold it like this and 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.940
 let's go over it and now we're going 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.660
 to do an X is to say what are we going 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.420
 ride like this you see the X not well then what 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.390
 what I'm going to do is conar ancillo to catch 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.170
 the part that has remained below and the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.380
 I go and I'm going to simply hook it 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.149
 I'm worth what hit him, nothing, I repeat, I 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.600
 I put it like this and he tied it to me and I make a 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:54.530
 X the X ends up there towards 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.320
 the left side I put the crochet 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.660
 below and did not hook anything simply what 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.610
 I put underneath and now I have to 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.080
 hook I have to hook the last 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.020
 stamen that went over to the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.060
 most superior part of the X's I turn it 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 I hooked him 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.140
 and simply having a hook of the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.910
 coat 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.360
 and shot 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.210
 of the two habits so to speak 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.560
 they have left me over, I'm going to repeat it 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.560
 I make an X 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.510
 went under on hook 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.510
 and shot 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.370
 I already have my knot in new ones as we throw 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.379
 from one side of the other we will be able to 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.459
 press a little more or a little 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.829
 less 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.019
 this is important to tell you that the knot 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.840
 it's a little bit, so to speak, sliding 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.390
 then we are going to have to hold 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.819
 once we have done this knot 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.159
 the correct way is to leave this 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.440
 bit that has been left to us then 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.870
 here, it does not matter, we're not going to 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.720
 use and this the rest that is with what 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.180
 we will weave we will go through 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.250
 above our index finger of this 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.500
 way like that and the rest we grabbed it with 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.329
 the hand just has to grab like this 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.549
 because it's the most comfortable way it's worth 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.840
 have here a support on the finger not 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.959
 we can do it like that in the air 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.370
 we need a support this if you want 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.829
 so that you do not bother for the moment 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.540
 you can take like this and for the moment what 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.819
 we will need is with our finger 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.409
 fat and our index finger grab a 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.810
 little is scary because I already tell you that 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.400
 is the first knot that we have 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.019
 done we should squeeze it a lot 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.030
 because otherwise we will not be able to start 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.560
 to knit 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.209
 well from this has already been 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.459
 just like with the crochet 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.040
 looking for us in this way 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.090
 let's load the thread that is called 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.120
 load the hay that is what we do 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.280
 we just passed it below and I 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.800
 I say exhausted you have to grab it and it's 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.360
 it's gone you have to grab it like that just 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.430
 we pass it below and on the way back 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.890
 we hooked up and put it through 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.810
 knot hole and we have what 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.610
 same a crochet needle like today 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.069
 with a thread on top with a kind 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.829
 of and good 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.350
 we do not have caught with a thread and make it 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.470
 the same thing all the time we went through 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.860
 below and back we hooked and by 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.860
 inside 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.280
 and so I say let grabbing the chain 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.910
 with little fingers so you do not leave 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.180
 with these two fingers the same thing happened to him 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.590
 underneath and on the turn hooked to be able 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.790
 put in here 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.180
 I repeat went under hooked bag by 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.340
 the little hole 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.889
 step below you can see better what 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.410
 I have here did not pass the crochet 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:01.050
 under the turn I hooked it and I put it 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:06.629
 all 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:11.090
 the little hole I do the same underneath 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.090
 the turn in hook and below 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.150
 his hook 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.370
 and by the little hole 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.419
 I hooked him 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.250
 by the hole he hooked it by the 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.960
 Hole hooked it and through the hole 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.880
 it's just this all the time you see 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.550
 that is not complicated to start 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.949
 but yes it will serve us well I will 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.199
 take this out as you see this is what 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.180
 it is worth a kind of chain that there 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.190
 to be careful because if we pull 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.949
 Here we pull here we go is 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.169
 doing completely worth then there's 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.990
 to be careful, this is 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.690
 important that it seems very very simple and 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.400
 in fact, well, it's not, but it's very 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.960
 important that we practice it before 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.970
 learn anything else because it's going to 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.880
 allow to be fluent will allow us 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.479
 get loose with the crochet is going to 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.760
 allow you to catch your height driving the 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.370
 threads will allow us to catch a lot 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.979
 loose then when we do the 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.139
 chainstones like that in a way 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.380
 quick way is when we are going to be able to 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.080
 start learning the more tissues 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.280
 points and more things crochet but 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.680
 moment until we going to do 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.000
 this chain is what we have to 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.890
 practice practicing them 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.350
 videos and practice not fluency of not 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.100
 he knows he's going to do it fast and especially 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.570
 good and good because basically it's a 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.340
 crochet chain that as I have 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.520
 said is all beginning to be able 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.080
 start with the old crochet and good 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.090
 I hope you liked my video 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.920
 I hope you have understood it well and I 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.310
 I encourage camps and practice because you go to 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.470
 go learning another type of tissue 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.330
 if I learned no other type of knots and it's 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.860
 something very beautiful and nothing I hope you 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.860
 like and that my video has served you
