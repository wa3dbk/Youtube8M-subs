00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.110 
to work they're German spec so good luck
finding<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.650> coding<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.790> have<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.000> go

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
finding the coding you have to go

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.330 
finding the coding you have to go
through<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:41.390> little<00:04:41.570> bit<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:42.040> trouble<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.130> find

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
through a little bit of trouble to find

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.370 
through a little bit of trouble to find
them<00:04:43.550> but<00:04:44.510> aren't<00:04:44.720> they<00:04:44.840> worth<00:04:45.020> it

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
them but aren't they worth it

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.920 
them but aren't they worth it
they<00:04:45.620> pay<00:04:45.860> off<00:04:46.040> so<00:04:47.000> now<00:04:47.120> my<00:04:47.330> lights<00:04:47.600> are

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
they pay off so now my lights are

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.460 
they pay off so now my lights are
European<00:04:48.500> code<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:50.920> they're<00:04:51.920> hot<00:04:52.100> brother

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
European code and they're hot brother

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
European code and they're hot brother
let's<00:04:54.470> see<00:04:54.530> if<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.770> get<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.890> close-up<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.370> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
let's see if I can get a close-up of the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.659 
let's see if I can get a close-up of the
light<00:04:55.640> themselves

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.429 

you<00:05:00.879> can<00:05:01.000> see<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> LEDs<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:02.050> has<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.199> nice

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:02.439 
you can see the LEDs and it has a nice

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:09.340 
you can see the LEDs and it has a nice
hallow<00:05:02.740> symbol<00:05:03.990> shining<00:05:04.990> through

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.500 

and<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.400> American<00:05:10.880> ones<00:05:11.060> this<00:05:11.300> whole

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
and in the American ones this whole

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.320 
and in the American ones this whole
section<00:05:11.960> in<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.290> American<00:05:12.770> spec<00:05:13.070> GTI<00:05:13.850> they

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
section in the American spec GTI they

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.460 
section in the American spec GTI they
don't<00:05:14.510> even<00:05:14.660> use<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.200> just<00:05:15.260> like<00:05:15.410> a

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
don't even use it it's just like a

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.290 
don't even use it it's just like a
glorified<00:05:15.680> reflector<00:05:16.400> now<00:05:16.910> these<00:05:17.060> actually

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
glorified reflector now these actually

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.690 
glorified reflector now these actually
are<00:05:17.540> being<00:05:17.720> utilized<00:05:17.870> which<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.470> think<00:05:18.710> my<00:05:19.340> GTI

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
are being utilized which I think my GTI

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.240 
are being utilized which I think my GTI
wants<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.180> have<00:05:20.300> happen<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.560> got<00:05:21.800> my<00:05:21.920> car<00:05:22.130> the

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
wants to have happen so I got my car the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.910 
wants to have happen so I got my car the
way<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.370> should<00:05:22.490> be<00:05:23.140> German<00:05:24.760> thank<00:05:25.760> you<00:05:26.920> thanks

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
way it should be German thank you thanks

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.710 
way it should be German thank you thanks
for<00:05:27.950> watching
