00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi i am the sander from return 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.759
 insider and I want you once today so 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.730
 a few critical thoughts on the topic 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.110
 will seek and health of the boy 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.110
 give horses on the way 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.039
 again and again I hear from the customer that 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.169
 they say yes I buy a young ready 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.539
 Buy a paragraph here is still 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.550
 healthy because nothing be spanking and so 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 I've lived my life for a long time or at least 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.920
 maybe half my life maybe one 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.260
 healthy attraction and sport partner 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.150
 Unfortunately that is not so often 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.540
 that is underestimated is that 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.500
 simply also the mare and the stallion 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.960
 as earth material quite relevant to 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.239
 long-term health of the horse 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.689
 Contribute or influence it greatly 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.400
 to have 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:59.710
 I always horses out 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.970
 big ones did not come that way 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.619
 absolutely must be bad yes 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.350
 in general but I keep coming back 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:07.119
 the horses really easy, so to speak 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 are bred to be bred 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.759
 and in the end but neither 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.790
 now from the mare only from the left 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.070
 really also on this breed 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.680
 that means they will be built 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.770
 it does not supply minerals 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.100
 Do not be regular even now 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.250
 especially the mare of a thought break 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.229
 subjected 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.689
 because every year in poland is to get 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.659
 of course for the mare already extreme 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.060
 also for an organism if 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.859
 Do not mix it with minerals 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.289
 with trace elements and also with 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.939
 vitamins regularly so to speak from 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.479
 mineral depot refilled 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.689
 becomes 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.880
 and unfortunately this problem is also 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.880
 especially among the races, so to speak 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.810
 also likes to be used as a battle breeds 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.939
 So there are also the orca unfortunately 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.770
 or even many haflinger will be there 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.009
 sometimes not real breeders 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.289
 but simply a multiplication and if 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.779
 just do not do that any buyer or weaner 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.369
 then find the poor animal then goes 

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:11.800
 just in the sausage in good German 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.069
 So the butcher and thus there are 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.200
 sometimes not even breeders 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.959
 Very strong on the quality of their 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.459
 pay attention to their breeding and accordingly 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.340
 also not very strong on the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.590
 pay attention to mineralization of the breeding mare 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.660
 so if you buy a young horse, yes 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.520
 that's what I always do personally 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.900
 if I had the opportunity then 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.660
 I would always look at me 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.160
 Which horse does this horse come from? 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.560
 it grew up 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.200
 it has had enough movement 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.880
 It had regular hoof care for 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.770
 that too is a huge problem many 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.870
 young horses during the hooves at all 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.750
 never made it to the stop then 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.190
 action is yes if yes and then 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.140
 it is often a problem because of the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.510
 horses just need to be regularly taken care of 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.800
 a competent farm expert 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.570
 you may have to be controlled 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.130
 do not always cut it out so much 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.200
 There are also young horses as well 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.030
 two three months old foals die 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.190
 problems in their statics have the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.770
 maybe one-sided also bockhoff 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.780
 tend and that just belongs to boys 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.570
 years or even young ones 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.240
 months already corrected then one has 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.190
 that also very quickly optimized again 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.540
 only if you understand that and then 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.790
 maybe the horses somehow up 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.080
 almen has or on big meadows and the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.830
 then collected again three years later 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.020
 become 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.730
 then often the catastrophe is already there 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.980
 because the horse is just awkward 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.450
 is one-sided and just from the balance 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.730
 and from the statics really one 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.910
 problem is that means we have to go for it 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.150
 Pay attention that the parents were healthy 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.760
 ideally the mare, too 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.900
 really well mineralized and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.470
 supplied trace elements and vitamins 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.990
 has been 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.540
 both in gestation and 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.670
 that the mare really does 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.010
 healthy foals can be used if 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.660
 the horse had already had 15 16 rides 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.560
 then they are often just like that 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.240
 leached that the reality good 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.310
 I'll say mineral depot now 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.020
 can pass and this youth 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.300
 just keep getting problems 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.180
 own and also as an adult man 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.489
 extremely long and tedious that 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.320
 mineral depot must try again 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.109
 build and it is indeed 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.239
 questionable if I am not such a complete 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.560
 mineralizes the young horse ob 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.660
 I ever really did 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.970
 that it is really fit and 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.880
 it can really be extremely expensive 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.640
 extremely cumbersome and therefore I advise 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.860
 you really buy with the horses where he is 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.360
 know-how is invested by the breeder 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.150
 maybe even a thousand more 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.940
 and and that it really matters 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.919
 The breeder must try long term 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.560
 easy to cover at his expense 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.070
 and then rather really well searched and 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.070
 really good young horses 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.350
 to produce in the end and then 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.540
 rather ask for a thousand more 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.880
 and explain that to the people as well 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.400
 a healthy young horse is easy 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.850
 the grower also money in hoof care in 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.460
 tÃ­as inspections in dental checks at 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.520
 young horse very important and also too 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.220
 into the corresponding mineralization of 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.530
 Zugpferde and just the corresponding 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.199
 Movement and care and correct 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.300
 attitude for the draft horses 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.580
 Of course it is also very important that the 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.000
 is sufficiently moved in the 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.729
 Pregnancy because only so can the 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.530
 photos really optimal with oxygen 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.900
 to be supplied only works that way 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.850
 the metabolism of the breeding mare and 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.220
 of course also of the foal in the 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.570
 Body of the mother optimal for horses 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.610
 he works over the hooves 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.800
 mechanism therefore the metabolism of the 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.690
 horses are also available 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.850
 time comes also a great free 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.970
 product that you can download 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.770
 and even if it's good if I'm too little 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.410
 is moved then it comes unfortunately 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.870
 to that the fetus in the mother's body 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.389
 often does not turn enough that is 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.979
 also in humans so movement is 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.250
 extremely important for the right one 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.229
 metabolism for optimal care 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.330
 from mare and foal and just as well 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.220
 really for the agility of the 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.470
 horses but also that photos actually 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.430
 in the womb and i have the experience 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.479
 made that if you just marry 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.360
 in the long term really until shortly before the 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.950
 born in so not just on the 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.620
 coupled but also very targeted 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.300
 just go for a walk as a hand 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.550
 then at the end still takes along or 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.590
 Run a little free and that 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.630
 controlled and conscious then does 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.520
 Just come the most uncomplicated 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.800
 horses births and the 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.130
 healthiest fittest ago 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.930
 in that sense, if you are a horse 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.090
 buys a little closer looks 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.460
 and rather pay a little more 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.010
 money because unfortunately it is actually so 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.460
 Cheap horses are usually in the 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.630
 long seen more expensive 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.760
