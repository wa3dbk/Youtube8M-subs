this one image now marci HDR pro has two
little<00:00:56.640> tweaks<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.809> very

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
little tweaks and that I think are very

little tweaks and that I think are very
very<00:00:58.230> important<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.750> near<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
very important one of which is near and

dear to my heart they actually added one

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
dear to my heart they actually added one
of<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.750> presets<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.769> called<00:01:05.010> Scott

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
of my presets in here it's called Scott

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
of my presets in here it's called Scott
five<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> fifth<00:01:07.380> precept<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
five because it was the fifth precept I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.940 
five because it was the fifth precept I
created<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.000> anyway<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.960> does<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.439> job<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
created but anyway it does a nice job so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.289 
created but anyway it does a nice job so
if<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.280> choose<00:01:11.520> Scott<00:01:11.850> five<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
if you just choose Scott five and it

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
if you just choose Scott five and it
tones<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> image<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.710> access<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
tones the image so you have access to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
tones the image so you have access to
that<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.490> an<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.240> copy<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that it's an you know your copy of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.890 
that it's an you know your copy of
Photoshop<00:01:18.780> cs6<00:01:19.700> however<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> one

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Photoshop cs6 however this is the one

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
Photoshop cs6 however this is the one
I'm<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.049> excited<00:01:22.229> about<00:01:22.680> edge<00:01:23.009> smoothness

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I'm really excited about edge smoothness

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
I'm really excited about edge smoothness
so<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> does<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> edges

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
so what it does is look at the edges

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.160 
so what it does is look at the edges
they're<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.240> harsh<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.020> which

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
they're a little bit harsh in here which

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
they're a little bit harsh in here which
is<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> typical<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.340> much<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
is kind of typical for this much you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
is kind of typical for this much you
know<00:01:30.119> toning<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> edge<00:01:31.890> smoothness<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
know toning but the edge smoothness it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
know toning but the edge smoothness it
actually<00:01:32.939> brings<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.390> detail<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
actually brings out detail and at the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.719 
actually brings out detail and at the
same<00:01:34.409> time<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.860> smoothes<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> image<00:01:35.579> watch

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
same time it smoothes the image watch

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.069 
same time it smoothes the image watch
you<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.119> click<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> does<00:01:36.900> its

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
you just click on it and it does its

here's before and after before and after
I<00:01:43.140> find<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.560> though<00:01:43.710> sometimes<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I find out though sometimes with this it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
I find out though sometimes with this it
helps<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.420> raise<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> strength<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.590> up

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
helps if you raise the strength back up

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.380 
helps if you raise the strength back up
just<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.430> bit<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:48.000> gonna<00:01:48.090> turn

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
just a little bit if you're gonna turn

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.020 
just a little bit if you're gonna turn
on<00:01:48.600> edge<00:01:49.110> smoothness<00:01:49.979> raise<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> strength

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
on edge smoothness raise the strength

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
on edge smoothness raise the strength
just<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.860> look

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
just a little bit and you get this look

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
just a little bit and you get this look
so<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.520> two<00:01:54.060> little<00:01:54.329> enhancements<00:01:54.840> again

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
so that's two little enhancements again

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.910 
so that's two little enhancements again

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.319 
is just simply a user interface tweak
that's<00:03:10.290> kind<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.650> cool<00:03:10.859> so<00:03:11.459> if<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.849> notice<00:03:12.120> I

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
that's kind of cool so if you notice I

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.699 
that's kind of cool so if you notice I
guess<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.780> first<00:03:12.900> thing<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.170> notice<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
guess the first thing you notice is the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.280 
guess the first thing you notice is the
interface<00:03:14.159> is<00:03:14.430> dark<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.569> it's<00:03:15.840> always<00:03:16.019> been

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
interface is dark and it's always been

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.809 
interface is dark and it's always been
light<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.799> grade<00:03:17.129> it<00:03:17.310> always<00:03:17.430> kind<00:03:17.699> of

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
light like grade it always kind of

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.780 
light like grade it always kind of
looked<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.290> every<00:03:19.290> other<00:03:19.470> Adobe<00:03:20.220> program<00:03:20.699> it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
looked like every other Adobe program it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.159 
looked like every other Adobe program it
looks<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> Acrobat<00:03:21.629> Reader<00:03:21.810> or

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
looks like the Acrobat Reader or

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.080 
looks like the Acrobat Reader or
something<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.040> love<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.609> they<00:03:23.730> change<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
something so I love that they change the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.939 
something so I love that they change the
interface<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.599> dark<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.500> actually<00:03:25.680> have

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
interface to dark but you actually have

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.920 
interface to dark but you actually have
a<00:03:26.010> control<00:03:26.430> over<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.209> change<00:03:27.449> it<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.569> a

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
a control over it you can change it to a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.439 
a control over it you can change it to a
darker<00:03:28.430> or<00:03:29.430> lighter<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.209> actually

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449

crop out so if you want to add a real

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.440 
crop out so if you want to add a real
quick<00:05:58.979> border<00:05:59.400> around<00:05:59.520> your<00:05:59.880> image<00:06:00.680> like<00:06:01.680> this

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
quick border around your image like this

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.390 
quick border around your image like this
all<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.720> have<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.990> do<00:06:04.169> is<00:06:04.440> crop<00:06:04.890> out<00:06:05.100> that's<00:06:05.310> a

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
all you have to do is crop out that's a

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.120 
all you have to do is crop out that's a
little<00:06:05.580> big<00:06:06.289> crop<00:06:07.289> it<00:06:07.410> in<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.590> little<00:06:07.800> bit<00:06:07.919> like

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
little big crop it in a little bit like

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.150 
little big crop it in a little bit like
that<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.729> you<00:06:09.510> can<00:06:09.630> get<00:06:09.840> any<00:06:10.200> size<00:06:10.620> border<00:06:11.039> you

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
that and you can get any size border you

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.250 
that and you can get any size border you
like<00:06:11.340> by<00:06:11.550> cropping<00:06:11.820> outside<00:06:12.330> of<00:06:12.450> there<00:06:12.630> so<00:06:13.080> I

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
like by cropping outside of there so I

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.719 
like by cropping outside of there so I
think<00:06:13.380> that<00:06:13.740> right<00:06:13.979> there<00:06:14.010> is<00:06:14.280> pretty<00:06:14.490> cool

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
think that right there is pretty cool

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.210 
think that right there is pretty cool
also<00:06:15.510> you<00:06:15.900> can<00:06:16.020> also<00:06:16.169> change<00:06:16.530> your<00:06:16.680> aspect

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
also you can also change your aspect

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.700 
also you can also change your aspect
ratio<00:06:17.340> on<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.330> fly<00:06:18.600> so<00:06:19.200> if<00:06:19.320> you<00:06:19.410> wanted<00:06:19.650> to

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
ratio on the fly so if you wanted to

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.990 
ratio on the fly so if you wanted to
change<00:06:19.890> this<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.220> no<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.400> think<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:20.669> want<00:06:20.760> to<00:06:20.880> do<00:06:20.970> a

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
change this to no I think I want to do a

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.200 
change this to no I think I want to do a
square<00:06:21.330> version<00:06:21.750> of<00:06:21.900> this<00:06:22.050> or<00:06:22.229> you<00:06:22.320> want<00:06:22.560> to<00:06:22.650> do

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
square version of this or you want to do

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.610 
square version of this or you want to do
any<00:06:24.210> different<00:06:24.419> one<00:06:24.720> they're<00:06:25.169> all<00:06:25.350> built

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
any different one they're all built

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.870 
any different one they're all built
right<00:06:25.680> in<00:06:26.039> here<00:06:26.070> so<00:06:26.370> that's<00:06:26.520> kind<00:06:26.729> of<00:06:26.789> nice

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
right in here so that's kind of nice

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.550 
right in here so that's kind of nice
let's<00:06:27.120> get<00:06:27.300> this<00:06:27.450> thing<00:06:27.660> back<00:06:27.810> down<00:06:28.050> to<00:06:28.260> normal

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
let's get this thing back down to normal

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.800 
let's get this thing back down to normal
let's<00:06:29.460> go<00:06:29.640> to<00:06:29.700> unconstrained<00:06:30.450> and<00:06:30.600> I'll<00:06:30.660> bring

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
let's go to unconstrained and I'll bring

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.060 
let's go to unconstrained and I'll bring
it<00:06:30.870> back<00:06:31.080> in<00:06:31.260> here<00:06:31.440> because<00:06:31.530> I<00:06:31.680> want<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:31.890> leave

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
it back in here because I want to leave

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.270 
it back in here because I want to leave
you<00:06:32.190> with<00:06:32.370> actually<00:06:33.360> it<00:06:33.539> is<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.890> feature<00:06:34.890> but

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
you with actually it is a feature but

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.160 
you with actually it is a feature but
it's<00:06:35.430> also<00:06:35.610> kind<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.090> a<00:06:36.210> photoshop<00:06:36.840> tip<00:06:37.200> so

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
it's also kind of a photoshop tip so

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.660 
it's also kind of a photoshop tip so
let's<00:06:39.590> get<00:06:39.710> it<00:06:39.860> cropped<00:06:40.040> back<00:06:40.220> down<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.490> side

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
let's get it cropped back down the side

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.040 
let's get it cropped back down the side
here's<00:06:41.030> the<00:06:41.180> tip<00:06:41.590> so<00:06:42.590> when<00:06:43.550> I<00:06:43.670> crop<00:06:44.180> I<00:06:44.510> like<00:06:44.870> to

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
here's the tip so when I crop I like to

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.740 
here's the tip so when I crop I like to
have<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.350> image<00:06:45.770> be<00:06:46.250> the<00:06:46.550> same<00:06:47.060> dimensions<00:06:47.600> as

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
have the image be the same dimensions as

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.720 
have the image be the same dimensions as
I<00:06:47.990> started<00:06:48.320> with<00:06:48.530> so<00:06:49.280> in<00:06:49.370> other<00:06:49.490> words

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
I started with so in other words

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.520 
I started with so in other words
normally<00:06:50.150> you<00:06:50.270> would<00:06:50.390> hold<00:06:50.570> a<00:06:50.690> shift<00:06:50.960> key<00:06:51.230> and

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
normally you would hold a shift key and

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.040 
normally you would hold a shift key and
then<00:06:52.340> you<00:06:52.490> have<00:06:52.670> to<00:06:52.790> constrain<00:06:53.330> it<00:06:53.570> to<00:06:53.900> where

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
then you have to constrain it to where

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.540 
then you have to constrain it to where
it<00:06:54.140> doesn't<00:06:54.440> change<00:06:54.680> the<00:06:54.920> dimensions<00:06:55.400> or<00:06:55.520> the

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
it doesn't change the dimensions or the

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.600 
it doesn't change the dimensions or the
aspect<00:06:56.090> ratio<00:06:56.150> of<00:06:56.660> the<00:06:56.750> crop<00:06:57.380> right<00:06:57.650> well

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
aspect ratio of the crop right well

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.230 
aspect ratio of the crop right well
there<00:06:59.000> actually<00:06:59.150> is<00:06:59.540> a<00:06:59.570> way<00:06:59.870> to<00:06:59.930> make

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
there actually is a way to make

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.820 
there actually is a way to make
constrained<00:07:02.240> the<00:07:02.750> original<00:07:03.230> ratio<00:07:03.380> of<00:07:03.680> your

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
constrained the original ratio of your

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.040 
constrained the original ratio of your
photo<00:07:04.070> to<00:07:04.550> be<00:07:04.670> the<00:07:04.820> default<00:07:05.150> and<00:07:05.420> the<00:07:05.870> way<00:07:05.990> to

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
photo to be the default and the way to

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.390 
photo to be the default and the way to
do<00:07:06.260> that<00:07:06.410> is<00:07:06.710> to<00:07:07.450> close<00:07:08.450> the<00:07:08.480> image<00:07:09.280> to<00:07:10.280> where

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
do that is to close the image to where

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.720 
do that is to close the image to where
nothing's<00:07:10.910> up<00:07:11.120> get<00:07:12.110> the<00:07:12.260> crop<00:07:12.500> tool<00:07:12.770> and<00:07:13.040> then

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
nothing's up get the crop tool and then

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.760 
nothing's up get the crop tool and then
just<00:07:13.760> choose<00:07:14.120> original<00:07:14.720> ratio<00:07:15.080> you<00:07:15.260> just<00:07:15.530> set

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
just choose original ratio you just set

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.740 
just choose original ratio you just set
the<00:07:15.920> default<00:07:16.310> now<00:07:16.550> so<00:07:17.120> when<00:07:17.240> I<00:07:17.270> open<00:07:17.570> up<00:07:17.630> an

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
the default now so when I open up an

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.210 
the default now so when I open up an
image<00:07:17.840> in<00:07:18.050> the<00:07:18.140> future<00:07:18.470> I<00:07:18.500> won't<00:07:18.740> have<00:07:18.950> to<00:07:19.070> hold

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
image in the future I won't have to hold

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.590 
image in the future I won't have to hold
the<00:07:19.310> shift<00:07:19.340> key<00:07:19.610> anymore<00:07:19.880> it'll

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
the shift key anymore it'll

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.450 
the shift key anymore it'll
automatically<00:07:21.140> be<00:07:21.320> set<00:07:21.590> to<00:07:21.980> the<00:07:22.100> original

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
automatically be set to the original

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.950 
automatically be set to the original
ratio<00:07:22.610> so<00:07:23.030> it<00:07:23.150> crops<00:07:23.390> with<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:23.690> same

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
ratio so it crops with the same

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.590 
ratio so it crops with the same
basically<00:07:24.830> aspect<00:07:25.700> ratio<00:07:26.000> was<00:07:26.090> the<00:07:26.210> first<00:07:26.390> one

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
basically aspect ratio was the first one

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.840 
basically aspect ratio was the first one
there<00:07:27.470> are<00:07:27.590> so<00:07:27.800> many<00:07:27.980> other<00:07:28.190> things<00:07:28.310> because

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:28.850 
there are so many other things because

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.670 
there are so many other things because
Adobe<00:07:29.330> did<00:07:29.510> this<00:07:29.630> very<00:07:29.840> cool<00:07:30.110> thing<00:07:30.380> they<00:07:30.530> did

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 
Adobe did this very cool thing they did

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.530 
Adobe did this very cool thing they did
a<00:07:30.710> thing<00:07:30.890> called<00:07:31.130> just<00:07:31.550> do<00:07:31.790> it<00:07:31.940> where<00:07:32.420> they

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.540 
a thing called just do it where they

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.480 
a thing called just do it where they
actually<00:07:32.930> take<00:07:33.170> a<00:07:33.410> couple<00:07:33.830> of<00:07:33.920> weeks<00:07:34.010> off<00:07:34.250> from

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
actually take a couple of weeks off from

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.160 
actually take a couple of weeks off from
programming<00:07:34.850> the<00:07:35.030> big<00:07:35.210> amazing<00:07:35.690> things<00:07:35.900> and

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.170 
programming the big amazing things and

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.610 
programming the big amazing things and
they<00:07:37.130> devote<00:07:37.760> that<00:07:37.790> time<00:07:38.000> to<00:07:38.750> fixing<00:07:39.140> tons<00:07:39.440> of

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
they devote that time to fixing tons of

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.570 
they devote that time to fixing tons of
little<00:07:39.740> things<00:07:40.040> there's<00:07:40.280> so<00:07:40.460> many

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
little things there's so many

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.610 
little things there's so many
improvements<00:07:40.940> throughout<00:07:41.780> the<00:07:42.110> program<00:07:42.500> they

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:42.620 
improvements throughout the program they

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.920 
improvements throughout the program they
brought<00:07:42.830> back<00:07:42.860> PDF<00:07:43.310> presentation<00:07:44.270> they<00:07:44.660> added

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:44.930 
brought back PDF presentation they added

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.600 
brought back PDF presentation they added
so<00:07:45.140> many<00:07:45.230> new<00:07:45.470> things<00:07:45.500> to<00:07:45.830> the<00:07:45.860> layers<00:07:46.130> and

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
so many new things to the layers and

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.030 
so many new things to the layers and
it's<00:07:46.820> it's<00:07:47.150> tremendous<00:07:47.930> it's<00:07:48.410> much<00:07:48.800> much

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040 
it's it's tremendous it's much much

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.540 
it's it's tremendous it's much much
faster

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:49.550 
faster

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.180 
faster
lots<00:07:50.360> of<00:07:50.510> tweaks<00:07:50.780> lots<00:07:51.410> of<00:07:51.500> enhancements<00:07:52.040> you
