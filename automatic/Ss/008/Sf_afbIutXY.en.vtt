00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
to be the big winners in this there's a

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.960 
to be the big winners in this there's a
global<00:00:24.930> event<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.890> where<00:00:26.670> it's

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
global event like this where it's

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.259 
global event like this where it's
releasing<00:00:28.369> decades<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.609> stored<00:00:29.910> up<00:00:30.090> energy

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
releasing decades of stored up energy

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
releasing decades of stored up energy
where<00:00:30.779> we've<00:00:30.929> borrowed<00:00:31.309> prosperity<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
where we've borrowed prosperity out of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.450 
where we've borrowed prosperity out of
the<00:00:32.850> future<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.870> spend<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> today<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the future to spend it today this you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
the future to spend it today this you
know<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> whole<00:00:35.880> boom<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.510> we've<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:37.050> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
know the whole boom that we've had is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.979 
know the whole boom that we've had is
credit<00:00:38.160> based<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.820> when<00:00:39.450> something<00:00:39.719> like

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
credit based and when something like

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100 
credit based and when something like
that<00:00:40.200> collapses<00:00:40.969> you<00:00:41.969> still<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.719> debt

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that collapses you still have that debt

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
that collapses you still have that debt
laying<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> future<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.700> has

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
laying out there in the future that has

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.600 
laying out there in the future that has
to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.210> repaid<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.170> typically<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:49.610> not

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
to be repaid so typically it's it's not

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.860 
to be repaid so typically it's it's not
a<00:00:50.640> good<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.360> there's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> lot<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
a good thing where there's a lot of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
a good thing where there's a lot of
winners<00:00:52.199> gold<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.039> silver<00:00:53.399> should<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
winners gold and silver should be the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
winners gold and silver should be the
biggest<00:00:54.930> winners<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> comes<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
biggest winners but when it comes to

that's whipped up from nothing and then

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
that's whipped up from nothing and then
you<00:01:53.970> use<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.530> currency<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.890> based<00:01:56.100> on

you use that currency that's based on
nothing<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> whip<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.479> currency<00:01:57.840> from

nothing to whip up more currency from
nothing<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.909> owed<00:02:00.119> back<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.780> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
nothing but it's all owed back and so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
nothing but it's all owed back and so
the<00:02:01.950> countries<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the countries that are going to do the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.600 
the countries that are going to do the
best<00:02:04.110> out<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.920> probably<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> kind

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
best out of this are probably the kind

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.150 
best out of this are probably the kind
