interface<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.460> line<00:01:27.670> six<00:01:27.970> interface<00:01:28.509> has

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
interface the line six interface has

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.870 
interface the line six interface has
additional<00:01:29.560> models<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.280> might<00:01:30.460> not<00:01:30.640> see

additional models that you might not see

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.710 
additional models that you might not see
here<00:01:31.329> because<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.960> needs<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.229> be<00:01:32.439> plugged<00:01:32.710> in

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
here because it needs to be plugged in

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.060 
here because it needs to be plugged in
this<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.899> why<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.110> missing<00:01:35.530> models<00:01:35.920> line

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070
