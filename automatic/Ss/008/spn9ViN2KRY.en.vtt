Queen's<00:01:49.380> onion<00:01:50.209> experimenting<00:01:51.209> with<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.539> a

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
Queen's onion experimenting with that a

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.510 
Queen's onion experimenting with that a
little<00:01:51.690> bit<00:01:54.470> yeah<00:01:55.470> i<00:01:55.740> recently<00:01:56.099> tried

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
little bit yeah i recently tried

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.919 
little bit yeah i recently tried
something<00:01:57.179> funky<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.050> which<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.830> not

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
something funky there which I will not

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.740 
something funky there which I will not
sure<00:02:00.929> will<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.319> repeat<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.670> d5<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.539> already

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
sure will not repeat with d5 I already

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.199 
sure will not repeat with d5 I already
have<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> bad<00:02:04.259> position<00:02:04.410> there<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.069> know<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
have a bad position there I know that

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.199 
have a bad position there I know that
they<00:02:06.509> normally<00:02:06.869> play<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:08.220> B<00:02:08.490> takes<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.179> I

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
they normally play with B takes but I

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.029 
they normally play with B takes but I
think<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.869> line<00:02:10.170> also<00:02:10.200> should<00:02:10.890> be

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
think that this line also should be

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.660 
think that this line also should be
quite<00:02:11.280> okay<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:13.410> looks<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:14.130> lot<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.700> um

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
quite okay this looks a lot like um

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.229 
quite okay this looks a lot like um
looks<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.849> lot<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:20.030> hedgehog<00:02:22.819> but<00:02:23.819> not

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
looks a lot like a hedgehog but not

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.250

this<00:02:57.640> idea<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.120> play<00:02:58.540> against<00:02:59.049> them<00:02:59.200> against

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
this idea to play against them against

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.580 
this idea to play against them against
the<00:03:00.400> sea<00:03:00.579> for<00:03:00.819> porn<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.930> take<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040

night I'm unsure that it could be a bit
tricky<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:07.440> taking<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> bishop<00:03:09.040> is

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159
