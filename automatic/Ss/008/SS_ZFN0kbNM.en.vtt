00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.189 
straight into this review starting by
having<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> quick<00:00:21.119> look<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> box<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
having a quick look at the box what you

having a quick look at the box what you
get<00:00:22.350> inside<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.039> then<00:00:23.160> we'll<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.430> into

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
get inside it and then we'll get into

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.970 
get inside it and then we'll get into
looking<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.510> detailed<00:00:25.019> look<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.010 

so<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.370> start<00:00:41.700> by<00:00:41.879> taking<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.480> look<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.870> the

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
changing the modes and it made a massive

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.339 
changing the modes and it made a massive
difference<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.659> it<00:04:50.719> was<00:04:50.870> really<00:04:51.110> really

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349
