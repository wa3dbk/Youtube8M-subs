00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
slowly and the biggest change from

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.799 
slowly and the biggest change from
saturday<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> old<00:00:42.329> front<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
saturday is that the old front that it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.479 
saturday is that the old front that it
was<00:00:42.899> attached<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:43.620> dissipating<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
was attached to is now dissipating and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.069 
was attached to is now dissipating and
the<00:00:44.640> system<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.149> well<00:00:45.420> detached<00:00:45.809> from

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the system is now well detached from

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
the system is now well detached from
that<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.789> well-defined

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that and it has a much more well-defined

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
that and it has a much more well-defined
and<00:00:48.600> circular<00:00:49.260> appearance<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and circular appearance and this is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.830 
and circular appearance and this is
important<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.120> saturday<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.600> talked

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
important because on saturday we talked

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.510 
important because on saturday we talked
about<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> system<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
about how if the system is going to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
about how if the system is going to
develop<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> tropical<00:00:54.329> storm<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.289> really

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
develop into a tropical storm it really

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.010 
develop into a tropical storm it really
needs<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> become<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.850> well-defined<00:00:57.090> while

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
needs to become more well-defined while

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
needs to become more well-defined while
it<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> chance<00:00:58.949> south<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> high

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it has the chance south of the high

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
it has the chance south of the high
pressure<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> north<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.800> over

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pressure that is to the north of it over

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.880 
pressure that is to the north of it over

here before this giant front comes down

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.310 
here before this giant front comes down
from<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.220> northwest<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.510> drags<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.080> off

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
from the northwest and it drags this off

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.250

now the system will be passing the Outer

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.020 
Banks so that's still a long ways away
and<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.290> it's<00:03:19.470> difficult<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:20.190> say<00:03:20.459> whether<00:03:20.760> or

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and so it's difficult to say whether or

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.000 
and so it's difficult to say whether or
not<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.329> center<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.660> 91<00:03:22.079> will<00:03:22.319> actually<00:03:22.769> pass

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
not the center of 91 will actually pass

not the center of 91 will actually pass
over<00:03:23.609> land<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.290> fairly<00:03:25.530> likely<00:03:25.799> right

Saturday and when the European is
consistent<00:03:59.790> it's<00:03:59.909> usually<00:04:00.329> one<00:04:00.449> of<00:04:00.599> our<00:04:00.720> best

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959

models when it comes to tropical cyclone

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.809

forecasting<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:05.220> does<00:04:05.400> increase<00:04:05.639> the

the<00:04:57.570> air<00:04:57.750> in<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.110> storm<00:04:58.380> itself<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:59.010> so

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
the air in the storm itself and so

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.280 
the air in the storm itself and so
that's<00:04:59.280> usually<00:04:59.490> hindrance<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:00.960> want

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
that's usually hindrance and so you want

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.630 
that's usually hindrance and so you want
the<00:05:01.440> storm<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.950> be<00:05:02.070> able<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.310> recirculate

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
the storm to just be able to recirculate

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.550 
the storm to just be able to recirculate
that<00:05:03.120> air<00:05:03.330> round<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.900> round<00:05:04.050> gaining

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
that air round and round gaining

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.320 
that air round and round gaining
moisture<00:05:05.010> before<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.460> rises<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:06.000> becomes

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
moisture before it rises and becomes

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.060 
moisture before it rises and becomes
thunderstorms<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.410> problem<00:05:07.770> for<00:05:07.890> this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
thunderstorms the problem for this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.770 
thunderstorms the problem for this
system<00:05:08.220> is<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.850> is<00:05:08.970> not<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.600> most

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
system is that it is not the most

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.020 
system is that it is not the most
isolated<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.500> there<00:05:10.890> is<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.040> flow<00:05:11.790> from

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
isolated because there is this flow from

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.750 
isolated because there is this flow from
the<00:05:12.150> Northwest<00:05:12.680> out<00:05:13.680> of<00:05:13.830> this<00:05:13.920> pocket<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.490> dry

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
the Northwest out of this pocket of dry

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.240 
the Northwest out of this pocket of dry
air<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:15.510> exists<00:05:16.020> from<00:05:16.230> Cape<00:05:16.530> Canaveral<00:05:16.890> up

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
air that exists from Cape Canaveral up

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.160 
air that exists from Cape Canaveral up
to<00:05:17.460> Cape<00:05:17.730> Hatteras<00:05:17.970> I'll<00:05:18.660> actually<00:05:18.930> outline

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
to Cape Hatteras I'll actually outline

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.270 
to Cape Hatteras I'll actually outline
it<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:19.320> little<00:05:19.440> bit<00:05:19.620> better<00:05:19.740> here<00:05:20.010> it's<00:05:20.160> this

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
it a little bit better here it's this

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.950 
it a little bit better here it's this
area<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.730> clear<00:05:21.000> skies<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.630> can<00:05:21.780> see

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
area of clear skies that you can see

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.230 
area of clear skies that you can see
with<00:05:22.140> with<00:05:22.470> limited<00:05:22.890> clouds<00:05:23.220> and<00:05:23.520> this<00:05:24.000> dry

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
with with limited clouds and this dry

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.030 
with with limited clouds and this dry
air<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.510> getting<00:05:24.600> pulled<00:05:25.020> down<00:05:25.320> into<00:05:25.590> the

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
air is getting pulled down into the

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.130 
air is getting pulled down into the
circulation<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.730> 91<00:05:27.180> L<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.540> I<00:05:27.570> think<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:27.930> may

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
circulation of 91 L and I think this may

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.290 
circulation of 91 L and I think this may
be<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.350> problem<00:05:28.590> for<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.130> over<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.730> next<00:05:29.940> 48

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
be a problem for it over the next 48

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.550 
be a problem for it over the next 48
hours<00:05:30.420> or<00:05:30.720> so<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.170> may<00:05:31.290> inhibit

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
hours or so that may inhibit

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.950 
hours or so that may inhibit
thunderstorm<00:05:32.250> formation<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.090> consistency

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
thunderstorm formation and consistency

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.630 
thunderstorm formation and consistency
and<00:05:34.140> this<00:05:34.620> may<00:05:34.770> prevent<00:05:35.100> any<00:05:35.340> real

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
and this may prevent any real

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.580 
and this may prevent any real
strengthening<00:05:36.300> of<00:05:36.420> the<00:05:36.450> system<00:05:36.960> during<00:05:37.500> the

that jet stream that we talked about

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.280 
that jet stream that we talked about

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.810 
starts to pull air away in the upper
levels<00:05:58.680> we<00:05:58.980> may<00:05:59.160> see<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.490> start<00:05:59.730> to

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
levels we may see the start to

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.640 
levels we may see the start to
strengthen<00:06:00.300> in<00:06:00.480> this<00:06:00.720> area<00:06:01.080> here<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.410> this<00:06:01.590> is

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
strengthen in this area here and this is

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.920 
strengthen in this area here and this is
where<00:06:01.770> most<00:06:02.100> storms<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.730> this<00:06:02.850> type<00:06:03.150> 10<00:06:03.780> to

where most storms of this type 10 to

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.360 
where most storms of this type 10 to
strengthen<00:06:04.320> in<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.470> early<00:06:04.740> season<00:06:04.890> is<00:06:05.190> when

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
strengthen in the early season is when

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.940 
strengthen in the early season is when
they're<00:06:05.520> recurve<00:06:06.000> engorda<00:06:06.950> northwestern

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
they're recurve engorda northwestern

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.470 
they're recurve engorda northwestern
Atlantic<00:06:08.040> that's<00:06:08.610> when<00:06:08.880> they<00:06:08.970> start<00:06:09.270> to<00:06:09.450> go

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
Atlantic that's when they start to go

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.750 
Atlantic that's when they start to go
and<00:06:09.990> that's<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:11.010> danger<00:06:11.280> with<00:06:11.400> this<00:06:11.550> system

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
and that's the danger with this system

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.550 
and that's the danger with this system
as<00:06:12.030> it<00:06:12.060> comes<00:06:12.360> up<00:06:12.480> towards<00:06:12.780> North<00:06:12.960> Carolina<00:06:13.380> is

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
as it comes up towards North Carolina is

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.770 
as it comes up towards North Carolina is
something<00:06:13.950> like<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.250> European<00:06:14.700> solution<00:06:15.240> may

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
something like the European solution may

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.270 
something like the European solution may
happen<00:06:16.050> where<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.500> starts<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:16.920> become<00:06:17.070> a

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
happen where this starts to become a

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.960 
happen where this starts to become a
stronger<00:06:17.700> tropical<00:06:18.330> storm<00:06:18.600> as<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.810> recurs<00:06:19.970> but

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
stronger tropical storm as it recurs but

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.510 
stronger tropical storm as it recurs but
if<00:06:21.210> it<00:06:21.390> is<00:06:21.420> in<00:06:21.660> a<00:06:21.720> weaker<00:06:22.050> state<00:06:22.410> when<00:06:23.370> it's

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
if it is in a weaker state when it's

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.310 
if it is in a weaker state when it's
coming<00:06:23.790> up<00:06:24.030> here<00:06:24.270> off<00:06:24.420> of<00:06:24.600> South<00:06:24.780> Carolina

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
coming up here off of South Carolina

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.680 
coming up here off of South Carolina
because<00:06:25.530> of<00:06:25.770> this<00:06:25.860> dry<00:06:26.190> air<00:06:26.460> here<00:06:26.910> then<00:06:27.570> it

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
because of this dry air here then it

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.600 
because of this dry air here then it
won't<00:06:27.870> be<00:06:27.930> deepening<00:06:28.350> quite<00:06:28.620> as<00:06:28.800> much<00:06:29.040> as<00:06:29.340> it

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
won't be deepening quite as much as it

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.760 
won't be deepening quite as much as it
could<00:06:29.820> if<00:06:30.060> it<00:06:30.180> was<00:06:30.330> developing<00:06:30.900> today<00:06:31.200> or

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
could if it was developing today or

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.280 
could if it was developing today or
tomorrow<00:06:32.090> into<00:06:33.090> a<00:06:33.120> stronger<00:06:33.630> storm<00:06:33.990> so

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
tomorrow into a stronger storm so

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.740 
tomorrow into a stronger storm so
essentially<00:06:35.100> the<00:06:35.640> more<00:06:35.850> it<00:06:35.910> strengthens<00:06:36.450> now

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
essentially the more it strengthens now

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.840 
essentially the more it strengthens now
the<00:06:37.710> more<00:06:37.890> it<00:06:37.950> will<00:06:38.040> strengthen<00:06:38.250> later<00:06:38.610> the

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
the more it will strengthen later the

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.370 
the more it will strengthen later the
less<00:06:39.030> it<00:06:39.210> strengthens<00:06:39.600> now<00:06:39.810> the<00:06:39.870> week

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
less it strengthens now the week

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.320 
less it strengthens now the week
it<00:06:40.500> will<00:06:40.650> be<00:06:40.770> later<00:06:41.010> so<00:06:41.340> root<00:06:41.670> for<00:06:41.910> it<00:06:41.970> to<00:06:42.090> stay

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
it will be later so root for it to stay

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.900 
it will be later so root for it to stay
week<00:06:42.630> during<00:06:43.170> the<00:06:43.320> next<00:06:43.470> day<00:06:43.740> or<00:06:43.890> two<00:06:43.920> east<00:06:44.730> of

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
week during the next day or two east of

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.580 
week during the next day or two east of
Florida<00:06:45.360> because<00:06:45.510> that<00:06:45.840> will<00:06:45.990> decrease<00:06:46.410> its

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
Florida because that will decrease its

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.950 
Florida because that will decrease its
chances<00:06:46.980> of<00:06:47.130> becoming<00:06:47.310> too<00:06:48.240> tremendous<00:06:48.750> of<00:06:48.870> a
