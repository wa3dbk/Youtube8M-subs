00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 In Medellin you breathe fashion 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.639
 we breathe during all the months of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.139
 year but when this time comes that it 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.029
 It also becomes the catwalk more 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.520
 important fashion in Colombia because 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 with more reason and it turns out that in this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.269
 fashion search also comes that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 search to become perfect being 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.359
 imperfect and even more women 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 beautiful to see what they do not have in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.719
 this initiative and thinking of all the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.790
 problems that this is generating within 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 of the minds of our young people and of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 ourselves as adults comes a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.469
 different gangway the angels catwalk 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.780
 that will be made on the 27th we are going to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.430
 tell where I am with natalia with paula 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.809
 representatives of precisely this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.210
 parade welcome thank you for 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.860
 accompany us thank you from where the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.090
 idea of ​​angels 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.090
 Angeles born of an initiative ago 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.670
 some three years to the third version 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.909
 where we want to promote beauty a lot 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.149
 of women at the level 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.609
 very natural to promote that there is 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.850
 an acceptance starting with an acceptance 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.530
 of what we have but also 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.450
 promoting that woman's projection 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.390
 then what do we want in passing the angel 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.069
 is to show that women are much more than 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.229
 body is much more than falling is much 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.000
 more than fashion the woman feels that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.090
 woman wants the woman to dream that the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.729
 woman vision has that behind all 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.280
 those facades there is a woman who suffers 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.319
 a woman who has lived situations of 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.329
 vulnerability in front of his family 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.659
 in front of his life project in front of his 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.239
 study jobs and others and pass the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.420
 angel is this year wants 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:51.679
 reinforce more and more that the woman is worth 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 that is worth a lot and that has a lot 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.920
 very much to give true then not the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.170
 no stigmatization that if this is so 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.790
 and guasa that if you can enter or not 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 you may come in 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.500
 and the non-exclusion of the woman who is so 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.810
 important in that measure of ideas 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.670
 then those who participate in the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.190
 catwalk break the schemes of 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.810
 traditional modeling this is how it is done 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.200
 the casting then for the parade to 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.290
 angels or how is the form of which 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.210
 with which you interpret this 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.140
 empowerment also of women and 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.500
 your body looks right now we have 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.270
 a corporation that girls arrive 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.940
 with different problems 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.280
 and they live for a few years about 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.580
 processes where they manage to resignify 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.410
 as women examples as such 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.920
 people with bulimia problems 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.200
 anorexia we have a girl of 14 years who 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.590
 was sexually abused she decides 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.450
 say yes to life has your baby and 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.870
 she tells the testimony of this 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.570
 then those girls become 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.580
 Generating values ​​for others 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.980
 Women is what we do on the catwalk 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.830
 as she does in it she tells her 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.570
 testimony there or through some form 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.880
 playful they are telling the story of each 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.010
 who how the runway works this year 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.680
 it's a woman, gestation, then you're the same 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.870
 is paraded they are prepared by a 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.890
 agency of professional models and 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.320
 they parade but in a few seconds of 30 a 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.550
 50 seconds they tell what they 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.530
 they lived 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.840
 and it has been a tremendous impact on our 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.990
 city ​​because it has been able to reach 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.380
 very much further apart I am particularly 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.700
 one of which we are organizers this 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.350
 year I'm inside the catwalk and inside 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 of all this I have the testimony of the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.390
 part the vigorexia true aa during 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.390
 long time the very thin girl very 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.920
 thin very thin in the 80s I do not know 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.270
 used to make it so thin but the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.720
 models and the queens of the masters 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.620
 indicate had more ram more carnitas and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.120
 I start the fight with the mirror to see me 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.280
 so thin and want to see teachers to 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.050
 Teachers started with a few diets 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.750
 hypercaloric four hours in the 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.150
 gym for weight volume 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.370
 with a certain obsession but my heart 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.200
 sad my heart has marked my heart 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.090
 wrong certain crying sad and came to that 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.900
 corporation and a transformation in my 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.390
 life I see something that what I heard that 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.610
 she's pretty and I have the passion to be able 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.960
 live safely through the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.930
 exercise of the diet that you were 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.280
 doing is supposedly getting 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.290
 the goal that you had formed 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.330
 principle get more muscle mass 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.920
 suddenly see you a little bit bigger 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.020
 but that fills the gaps 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.490
 emotional that bring you to one 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.070
 suffer from a disease of this type 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.690
 it is true for ten years to suffer this 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.820
 disease I realize that in 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.590
 actually this is not worth it in 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.310
 reality that was inside me because 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.110
 that pain because those words of a 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.120
 close family friends is that mockery 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.060
 because always when the skinny 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.980
 skinny are pulled from a bone calan hype 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.830
 I do not know how many things and compliments 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.169
 redundant in this situation but 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.080
 I realize my own acceptance 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.629
 true that what's beyond what 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.699
 something that my heart must fill for me 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.099
 to be able to accept what I am but having 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.379
 in account also olga that not to fall 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.419
 as to the other extreme is true and that of 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.909
 wide normal lighting or are not bad 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.069
 are bad of adif mood is bad 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.780
 but if you keep the balance spend the 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.699
 angels looking for a balance is more 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.069
 important to be like that is 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.289
 look for a balance between the body the 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.699
 soul the true spirit but how do they 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.289
 to convince the designers not to 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.330
 let's tell ourselves lies and this has been a 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.729
 controversy that has existed since he has 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.469
 come out the fashion fair where in a 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.599
 they even came and thought of the 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.849
 models that had to have a weight 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.349
 healthy however the designers 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.840
 they said there I die the pain with 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.479
 you but is that I design is for 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.099
 skinny as they have done to convince the 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.409
 part of fashion to get involved 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.229
 with the parade is actually something very 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.690
 special because this project of 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.090
 catwalk angels impact the hearts of 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.819
 the sponsors I can mention in 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.090
 this moment to say something one of 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.950
 our most recognized designers who 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.200
 he wears really thin women 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.020
 carlos mario miranda this tells us to 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.270
 our girls among them among some 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.250
 because of the sponsors because what 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.870
 we want to show the world is 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.460
 that the woman is much more than a case 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.980
 that we from our interior 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.900
 we have a lot to give the theme of 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.910
 this year as Paula said is a woman who 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.030
 station you're in shape with note you're going 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.190
 for example I am spring-summer by 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.500
 that persevered in the middle of the storm is 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.300
 leave that message to women that 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.100
 we are much more stops all over the world 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.020
 can go to the angels catwalk 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.480
 that's how we remember then it's going to be the 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.160
 June 27 at 5 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.230
 mall the mills in the 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.030
 skiman which is on the fourth floor a 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.610
 super supportive environment for this and the 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.650
 invitation is that we really go 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.540
 this kind of events because we have 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.910
 really a commitment with us 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.440
 we are the hardest ourselves with 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.060
 we ourselves are often the 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.830
 that we punish ourselves even more than 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.800
 society the same friends and the 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.600
 men so we have to understand that 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.760
 this is your boy is the one we came with 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.680
 that we were to take care of it, protect it 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.230
 as you say we have a lifestyle 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.970
 healthy but we do not enslave 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.470
 body because there are much more things 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.650
 important that are much more background 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:33.580
 thanks for joining us 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.580
 there I will be with all security
