00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
there's a little trick that I want to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.520 
there's a little trick that I want to
show<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.570> makes<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.080> little<00:03:12.320> bit

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530

easier<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:14.810> everything<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.350> reverse<00:03:15.650> order

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
easier so do everything in reverse order

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.740 
easier so do everything in reverse order
and<00:03:16.310> start<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.970> last<00:03:17.180> thing<00:03:17.420> which<00:03:17.600> is

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
and start with the last thing which is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.720 
and start with the last thing which is
releasing<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.380> bungee<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:18.980> was<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> last

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
releasing that bungee that was the last

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.880 
releasing that bungee that was the last
thing<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:19.970> we<00:03:20.150> did<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.570> then<00:03:21.170> start<00:03:21.709> with

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
thing that we did and then start with

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.830 
thing that we did and then start with
the<00:03:22.130> outer<00:03:22.370> clip<00:03:22.910> first<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:23.630> start

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the outer clip first and start

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.650 
the outer clip first and start
unclipping<00:03:24.470> them<00:03:24.739> all<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.100> way<00:03:25.220> down<00:03:25.660> working

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
unclipping them all the way down working

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
unclipping them all the way down working
towards<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.440> when<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.650> get<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:27.950> last

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
towards you so when you get to that last

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.640 
towards you so when you get to that last
one<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.300> all<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.510> have<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.720> do<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.320> start

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
one and all you have to do is to start

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.680 
one and all you have to do is to start
to<00:03:30.830> roll<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.280> up<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:31.700> here's<00:03:32.000> my<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:32.420> trick

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
to roll it up now here's my little trick

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.240 
to roll it up now here's my little trick
have<00:03:33.380> your<00:03:33.530> partner

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
have your partner

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.320 
have your partner
unhook<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.239> boma<00:03:36.110> or<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.620> akka<00:03:36.890> brace<00:03:37.330> so

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
unhook the boma or the akka brace so

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.320 
unhook the boma or the akka brace so
that<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.750> pull<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:40.370> almas<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.120> you

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
that you can pull in the almas and you

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.180 
that you can pull in the almas and you
get<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> better<00:03:41.720> angle<00:03:42.110> for<00:03:42.170> rolling<00:03:42.709> up<00:03:42.830> that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
get a better angle for rolling up that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.670 
get a better angle for rolling up that
trampoline<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.959> see<00:03:45.140> how<00:03:45.290> much<00:03:45.440> easier

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
trampoline so you see how much easier

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.820 
trampoline so you see how much easier
that<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.700> angle<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.120> much<00:03:47.269> better<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.830> it

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
that is the angle is much better and it

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.590 
that is the angle is much better and it
makes<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.250> easier<00:03:49.610> for<00:03:49.640> me<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.000> roll<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.540> up

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
makes it easier for me to roll that up

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.479 
makes it easier for me to roll that up
because<00:03:50.989> it's<00:03:51.170> closer<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.560> me<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:51.950> it's

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
because it's closer to me and it's

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.900 
because it's closer to me and it's
facing<00:03:52.730> me<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.390> just<00:03:54.019> roll<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.410> on<00:03:54.500> up<00:03:54.769> get<00:03:55.760> it

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
facing me so just roll it on up get it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.809 
facing me so just roll it on up get it
nice<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.120> tight

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
nice and tight

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.959 
nice and tight
then<00:03:58.090> just<00:03:59.079> wrap<00:03:59.590> those<00:03:59.859> bungees<00:04:00.340> around<00:04:01.200> and

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
then just wrap those bungees around and

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.110 
then just wrap those bungees around and
secure<00:04:03.969> everything<00:04:04.389> and<00:04:04.900> you're<00:04:05.530> done<00:04:06.120> so

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
secure everything and you're done so

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.390 
secure everything and you're done so
that's<00:04:07.900> my<00:04:08.109> tip<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:08.590> releasing<00:04:09.310> that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
that's my tip is just releasing that

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.839 
that's my tip is just releasing that
little<00:04:10.409> akka<00:04:11.409> brace<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.099> then<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.760> know

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
little akka brace and then you know

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.640 
little akka brace and then you know
everything<00:04:13.060> works<00:04:13.329> great<00:04:13.629> so<00:04:13.659> there<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.290> go

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
everything works great so there you go

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.189 
everything works great so there you go
once<00:04:15.069> you<00:04:15.219> get<00:04:15.340> everything<00:04:15.400> cinched<00:04:16.090> up<00:04:16.239> then

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
once you get everything cinched up then

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.069 
once you get everything cinched up then
you<00:04:17.829> can<00:04:18.039> just<00:04:18.250> reinstall<00:04:18.699> your<00:04:19.329> your<00:04:19.900> akka

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
you can just reinstall your your akka

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.409 
you can just reinstall your your akka
brace<00:04:20.519> push<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.669> out<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.180> reattach<00:04:24.270> all<00:04:25.270> right

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
brace push it out and reattach all right

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.029 
brace push it out and reattach all right
