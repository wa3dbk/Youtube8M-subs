and integrity and all those kinds of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.939 
and integrity and all those kinds of
things<00:00:56.360> but<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> wasn't<00:00:57.690> until<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.960> read<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
things but it wasn't until I read the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
things but it wasn't until I read the
road<00:00:59.129> less<00:00:59.309> traveled<00:00:59.699> which<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.420> about

road less traveled which is really about

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.979 
road less traveled which is really about

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
to explore the kind of inner psyche why

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069 
to explore the kind of inner psyche why
we<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:32.939> why<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.840> do

in<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.140> words<00:01:43.409> stuff<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> was

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
in to put into words stuff that I was

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.340 
in to put into words stuff that I was
already<00:01:44.909> thinking<00:01:45.509> which<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.840> great<00:01:46.229> because

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
already thinking which was great because

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.410 
already thinking which was great because
I<00:01:46.470> could<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.710> relate<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.329> he

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I could really relate to it but but he

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
I could really relate to it but but he
also<00:01:48.570> opened<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:49.049> eyes<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.530> sorts<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
also opened my eyes on all sorts of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
also opened my eyes on all sorts of
other<00:01:49.950> things<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.610> mean<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.270> quickly

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
other things I mean just quickly

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
other things I mean just quickly
flicking<00:01:52.470> through<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
flicking through here on the on the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.359 
flicking through here on the on the
contents<00:01:54.299> part<00:01:54.509> he<00:01:55.229> talks<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.070> point

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
contents part he talks about the point

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.969 
contents part he talks about the point
of<00:01:56.549> having<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.880> brain<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
of having a brain that's just I just

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340 
of having a brain that's just I just
breathe<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.579> mean<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> way<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:01.020> goes<00:02:01.170> in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
breathe I mean and the way he goes in

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.630 
breathe I mean and the way he goes in
today<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.710> why<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:04.070> basically<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
today is about why we basically have to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.130 
today is about why we basically have to
use<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.060> our<00:02:06.740> mind<00:02:07.740> processes<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.580> survive

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
use that our mind processes to survive

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
use that our mind processes to survive
initially<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.619> how<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:10.979> we<00:02:11.069> become<00:02:11.489> when<00:02:11.940> we

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
initially but how when we become when we

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.660 
initially but how when we become when we
got<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> higher<00:02:12.690> orders<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
got the higher orders of

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.930 
got the higher orders of
we<00:02:15.240> actually<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.900> use<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.320> mind<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.400> choose

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
we actually can use that mind to choose

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.250 
we actually can use that mind to choose
the<00:02:18.450> way<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:18.750> live<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.050> we're<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.200> just

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the way we live so we're not just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.710 
the way we live so we're not just
reacting<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.010> life<00:02:20.210> like<00:02:21.210> running<00:02:21.510> away<00:02:21.660> from

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
reacting to life like running away from

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.750 
reacting to life like running away from
a<00:02:21.870> lion<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.350> see<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.740> hunting<00:02:23.550> for<00:02:23.670> an

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
a lion if we see it or hunting for an

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.070 
a lion if we see it or hunting for an
animal<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.360> feed<00:02:24.540> ourselves

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
animal so we can feed ourselves

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
animal so we can feed ourselves
we're<00:02:25.500> actually<00:02:25.650> choosing<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.060> want<00:02:27.330> to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
we're actually choosing what we want to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070 
we're actually choosing what we want to
do<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.600> our<00:02:27.690> life<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.690> anyone<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
do with our life so for anyone that

traveled and then you'll probably just

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.360 
traveled and then you'll probably just
devour<00:02:37.230> them<00:02:37.470> because<00:02:37.800> they're<00:02:38.250> just

devour them because they're just
