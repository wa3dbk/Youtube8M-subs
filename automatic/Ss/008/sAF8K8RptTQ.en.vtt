00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
it's just kind of a different feel when

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.630 
it's just kind of a different feel when
you<00:03:17.409> get<00:03:17.530> four<00:03:17.709> players<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.220> game<00:03:18.370> I

their character so you know Leonardo has
the<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.240> katanas<00:05:45.170> dual<00:05:45.410> katana<00:05:45.740> is<00:05:45.920> all<00:05:46.280> his

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
the the katanas dual katana is all his

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.850 
the the katanas dual katana is all his
attacks<00:05:46.760> are<00:05:46.940> based<00:05:47.090> around<00:05:47.270> that<00:05:47.740> there<00:05:48.740> are

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
attacks are based around that there are

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.330 
attacks are based around that there are
distance<00:05:49.250> attacks<00:05:49.580> so<00:05:51.190> some<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.250> the

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
distance attacks so some of the

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.170

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
attacks shredder is obviously big and

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.780 
attacks shredder is obviously big and
powerful<00:06:00.260> so<00:06:00.380> he<00:06:00.530> has<00:06:00.650> slow<00:06:00.980> really
