00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we make the most out of the rest of the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
we make the most out of the rest of the
year<00:01:41.939> before<00:01:42.180> worrying<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
year before worrying about the one to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.859 
year before worrying about the one to
come<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> 2010<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
come I mean think about it 2010 is

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
come I mean think about it 2010 is
almost<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.159> never<00:01:47.189> happen

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
almost over and it will never happen

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
almost over and it will never happen
again<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.630> here's<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.500> should

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
again so here's what I think we should
