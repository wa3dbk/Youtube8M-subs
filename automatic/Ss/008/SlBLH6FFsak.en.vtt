00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
Shaarawy who does you know what a bit of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.320

a<00:02:36.990> sway<00:02:37.260> past<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> want<00:02:38.640> Neymar<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> get

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
a sway past but I want Neymar to get

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.150

back some Bank some goals early on
because<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.520> do<00:02:41.580> feel<00:02:41.820> as<00:02:42.000> though<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.960> he

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
because I do feel as though if he

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.840 
because I do feel as though if he
manages<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.770> some<00:02:43.980> goals<00:02:44.220> early<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
manages to get some goals early on it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.240 
manages to get some goals early on it
really<00:02:45.360> really<00:02:45.960> increases<00:02:46.590> his<00:02:46.709> value<00:02:47.100> as<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
really really increases his value as a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.699 
really really increases his value as a
player<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.320> makes<00:02:49.590> him

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
player and you know it just makes him

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.920 
player and you know it just makes him
worth<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.070> whole<00:02:50.280> lot<00:02:50.340> more<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.910> kind<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.720> gets

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
worth a whole lot more and kind of gets

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.780 
worth a whole lot more and kind of gets
his<00:02:52.110> form<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.800> little<00:02:52.980> bit<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
his form going a little bit the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.640 
his form going a little bit the
formation<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.570> think<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.930> was<00:02:55.050> playing<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.500> this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
formation I think I was playing in this

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.830 
formation I think I was playing in this
is<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:56.390> 4-3<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:58.080> -<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.000> that's<00:03:00.000> what<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.420> I'm

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
is a 4-3 one - I think that's what I I'm

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.930 
is a 4-3 one - I think that's what I I'm
pretty<00:03:01.080> sure<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:01.350> what<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.980> what

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
pretty sure that's what it is and what

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.120 
pretty sure that's what it is and what
it<00:03:03.090> pretty<00:03:03.270> much<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.560> allows<00:03:04.890> me

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it pretty much is is that it allows me

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.250 
it pretty much is is that it allows me
to<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.490> center<00:03:06.060> forward<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.900> Center

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
to have a center forward and that Center

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.320 
to have a center forward and that Center
Ford<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.920> fact<00:03:08.160> El<00:03:08.340> Shaarawy<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.880> feel<00:03:09.180> as

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
Ford is in fact El Shaarawy I feel as

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
