showing<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.840> proper<00:02:20.379> clips<00:02:21.250> not<00:02:21.909> him

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
showing the proper clips not him

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.729 
showing the proper clips not him
quitting<00:02:22.659> in<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> wheelchair<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.530> just

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
quitting in the wheelchair that's just

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.100 
quitting in the wheelchair that's just
pathetic<00:02:24.299> you<00:02:25.299> know<00:02:26.010> true<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.329> so<00:02:28.690> true

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
pathetic you know true that is so true

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.130 
pathetic you know true that is so true
because<00:02:29.409> if<00:02:29.650> Bautista<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.780> number

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
because if Bautista is like the number

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.039 
because if Bautista is like the number
two<00:02:32.349> guy<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:33.700> example<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.569> rock<00:02:34.840> was

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
two guy for example like the rock was

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.649 
two guy for example like the rock was
number<00:02:35.349> two<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.680> stone<00:02:35.890> cold<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:37.090> would<00:02:37.390> make

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
number two is stone cold it would make

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.920 
number two is stone cold it would make
sense<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.319> Batista<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.909> have<00:02:40.209> some<00:02:40.540> clips

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
sense the Batista would have some clips

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.720
