00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
radical departure for us it's a

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.110 
radical departure for us it's a
brand-new<00:03:16.989> chassis<00:03:17.380> it's<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:18.340> heavier<00:03:18.760> better

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
brand-new chassis it's a heavier better

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.670 
brand-new chassis it's a heavier better
built<00:03:19.389> than<00:03:19.450> ever<00:03:19.690> before<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.319> could<00:03:20.470> it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
built than ever before you could it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.500 
built than ever before you could it
slays<00:03:20.919> built<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.310> tank<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.790> bad<00:03:22.030> boy<00:03:22.269> and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
slays built like a tank this bad boy and

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.210 
slays built like a tank this bad boy and
it's<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.290> new<00:03:23.410> chassis<00:03:23.650> now<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:23.919> can<00:03:24.040> see<00:03:24.190> that

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
it's a new chassis now you can see that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.770 
it's a new chassis now you can see that
it's<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.549> little<00:03:24.579> bit<00:03:24.819> wider<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.389> little<00:03:25.540> bit

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
it's a little bit wider a little bit

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.180 
it's a little bit wider a little bit
longer<00:03:25.930> than<00:03:26.200> our<00:03:26.290> previous<00:03:26.500> fights<00:03:26.950> thick

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
longer than our previous fights thick

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.050 
longer than our previous fights thick
and<00:03:27.340> that's<00:03:27.459> for<00:03:27.609> a<00:03:27.639> very<00:03:27.880> good<00:03:27.910> reason

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
and that's for a very good reason

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.180 
and that's for a very good reason
because<00:03:28.540> street<00:03:29.349> fighter<00:03:29.530> cross<00:03:29.620> tekken<00:03:29.769> is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
because street fighter cross tekken is

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.349 
because street fighter cross tekken is
all<00:03:30.310> about<00:03:30.489> bringing<00:03:30.849> great<00:03:31.060> fighting

all about bringing great fighting
franchises<00:03:32.109> together<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:33.010> wanted<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.310> pay

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489

homage<00:03:33.669> to<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.419> do<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.599> same<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:34.930> fight

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
homage to that and do the same for fight

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.539 
homage to that and do the same for fight
sticks<00:03:35.530> because<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:35.829> we<00:03:35.919> look<00:03:36.099> here<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
sticks because if we look here on the

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.460 
sticks because if we look here on the
table<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.209> see<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.079> can<00:03:38.230> actually

connect to fight sticks together and

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.960 
connect to fight sticks together and
when<00:03:41.319> they're<00:03:41.500> connected<00:03:41.889> together<00:03:42.010> it's<00:03:42.609> the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
when they're connected together it's the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.479 
when they're connected together it's the
exact<00:03:43.419> replica<00:03:44.019> same<00:03:44.319> dimension<00:03:44.919> same<00:03:45.190> size

you to to unscrew the side panel of your
and<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.709> can<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:02.980> there's<00:04:03.159> a<00:04:03.189> bolt<00:04:03.430> here<00:04:03.610> that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
and you can see there's a bolt here that

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.309 
and you can see there's a bolt here that
goes<00:04:03.909> on<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> front<00:04:04.390> as<00:04:04.569> well<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.290> can

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
goes on the front as well and you can

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.970 
goes on the front as well and you can
connect<00:04:05.769> two<00:04:05.950> sticks<00:04:06.250> together<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:08.860> think

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
connect two sticks together so I think

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.140 
connect two sticks together so I think
we're<00:04:09.220> about<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.459> check<00:04:09.670> out<00:04:09.790> something<00:04:10.120> that

the<00:04:42.039> rolls-royce<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.639> controllers<00:04:43.180> what<00:04:43.360> we

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
the rolls-royce of controllers what we

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.960 
the rolls-royce of controllers what we
tried<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.780> do<00:04:44.110> was<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.470> take<00:04:44.650> all<00:04:44.889> of<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.130> great

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
tried to do was to take all of the great

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.670 
tried to do was to take all of the great
quality<00:04:46.510> that<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:46.930> find<00:04:47.229> on<00:04:47.320> something<00:04:47.560> like

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
quality that you find on something like

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.350 
quality that you find on something like
our<00:04:47.919> arcade<00:04:48.370> fightstick<00:04:48.880> sand<00:04:49.090> actually

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
our arcade fightstick sand actually

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.879 
our arcade fightstick sand actually
marry<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.720> with<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.020> customization<00:04:50.500> of

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
marry that with a customization of

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.770 
marry that with a customization of
something<00:04:51.190> like<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.760> range<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.180> cyborg<00:04:52.630> rat

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
something like a range of cyborg rat

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.990 
something like a range of cyborg rat
mice<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:54.010> idea<00:04:54.039> behind<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.639> controller

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
mice so the idea behind the controller

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.480 
mice so the idea behind the controller
is<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.449> adapts<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.020> service<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.800> gamer<00:04:57.070> rather

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
is it adapts to service the gamer rather

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.040 
is it adapts to service the gamer rather
than<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.729> gamer<00:04:57.970> having<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.449> adapt<00:04:58.780> to

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
than the gamer having to adapt to

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.689 
than the gamer having to adapt to
service<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.530> controller<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.430> actually

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
service the controller you actually

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.460 
service the controller you actually
might<00:05:00.850> notice<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.750> kind<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.050> weird<00:05:02.260> as<00:05:02.380> I

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
might notice it's kind of weird as I

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.020 
might notice it's kind of weird as I
hold<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.830> up<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:03.160> you've<00:05:03.280> actually<00:05:03.340> got<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.820> D

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
hold this up so you've actually got to D

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.700 
hold this up so you've actually got to D
pads<00:05:04.330> well<00:05:04.570> that<00:05:04.660> was<00:05:04.810> with<00:05:04.960> me<00:05:05.169> demoing<00:05:05.500> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
pads well that was with me demoing the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.680 
pads well that was with me demoing the
sticker<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.639> controller<00:05:07.000> actually<00:05:07.360> earlier

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
sticker the controller actually earlier

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.510 
sticker the controller actually earlier
it's<00:05:08.199> one<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.349> the<00:05:08.470> great<00:05:08.650> features<00:05:08.800> about<00:05:09.280> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
it's one of the great features about the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.680 
it's one of the great features about the
controller<00:05:09.849> is<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.360> completely

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
controller is that it's completely

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.480 
controller is that it's completely
customizable<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.620> these<00:05:11.770> are<00:05:12.010> called<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.250> pro

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
customizable so these are called the pro

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.360 
customizable so these are called the pro
modules<00:05:13.000> here<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.510> actually<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.800> idea<00:05:15.190> is

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
modules here and actually the idea is

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.250 
modules here and actually the idea is
that<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.610> can<00:05:15.820> actually<00:05:15.910> take<00:05:16.300> out<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.780> d-pads

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
that I can actually take out the d-pads

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.930 
that I can actually take out the d-pads
or<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.590> analog<00:05:17.949> thumbsticks<00:05:18.370> I<00:05:18.550> can<00:05:18.669> swap

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
or the analog thumbsticks I can swap

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.700 
or the analog thumbsticks I can swap
them<00:05:19.120> around<00:05:19.210> at<00:05:19.599> any<00:05:19.750> part<00:05:20.139> of<00:05:20.349> the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
them around at any part of the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.529 
them around at any part of the
controller<00:05:21.070> itself<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:21.820> there's<00:05:22.210> not<00:05:22.360> really

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
controller itself so there's not really

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.510 
controller itself so there's not really
supposed<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:23.080> be<00:05:23.199> 2d<00:05:23.650> pads<00:05:23.919> there<00:05:24.160> but<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.400> just

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
supposed to be 2d pads there but it just

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.860 
supposed to be 2d pads there but it just
goes<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.789> show<00:05:24.849> that<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.090> can<00:05:25.270> do<00:05:25.449> that<00:05:25.599> if<00:05:25.840> you

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
goes to show that you can do that if you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.350 
goes to show that you can do that if you
wish<00:05:26.199> so<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:27.340> is<00:05:27.490> kind<00:05:27.699> of<00:05:27.789> nuts<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:28.270> is

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
wish so this is kind of nuts and this is

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.659 
wish so this is kind of nuts and this is
only<00:05:28.479> on<00:05:28.750> on<00:05:28.960> playstation<00:05:29.680> 3<00:05:29.919> now<00:05:30.099> a<00:05:30.250> lot<00:05:30.639> of

and only the ps3 version you Mabel up to
you<00:06:01.360> able<00:06:01.599> to<00:06:01.690> hold<00:06:01.870> down<00:06:02.020> start<00:06:02.409> and<00:06:02.530> select

you able to hold down start and select
45<00:06:03.190> seconds<00:06:03.699> and<00:06:04.030> what<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.240> does<00:06:04.389> is<00:06:04.449> it

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
45 seconds and what it does is it

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.719 
45 seconds and what it does is it
reverses<00:06:05.199> the<00:06:05.349> trigger<00:06:05.620> RT<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:06.490> it<00:06:06.580> actually

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
reverses the trigger RT so it actually

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.310 
reverses the trigger RT so it actually
makes<00:06:07.389> the<00:06:07.659> rear<00:06:08.110> trigger<00:06:08.440> your<00:06:08.830> fire

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
makes the rear trigger your fire

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.690 
makes the rear trigger your fire
instead<00:06:09.740> of<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.920> front<00:06:10.130> one<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:10.490> it's<00:06:10.610> just

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
instead of the front one so it's just

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.040 
instead of the front one so it's just
neat<00:06:10.970> little<00:06:11.150> things<00:06:11.390> like<00:06:11.570> that<00:06:11.630> that<00:06:11.810> we've
