00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.910
 building up for festivals or concert 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.680
 and I passed that and the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.390
 have been given a choice 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.740
 and I want to show you today 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.880
 First, it is not intended at all 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.380
 to show off 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 the you follow that saw as where you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 all very much like a video of mine 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 presents so I just do that now 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.309
 time I start with preschoolers 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.899
 my mothers are just coming back from 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.899
 America is also the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.610
 Most presents come from America 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.950
 yes I don't know anything about the prices either 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 so just search it or via the internet 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.879
 get bike can find where i go it 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 don't look up for you because i think 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.809
 a little weird to price of products 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.460
 to look up that have been given to me 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.289
 first in this bag and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 I'm really excited about this because 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.939
 yes i do like brushes and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.060
 a foam applica thor 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.840

 but this is a pretty small cute 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.130
 and with a yes handle well with the stick 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.700

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.920
 of applicata becomes beautifull soft 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 bamboo and recycled materials 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 so that also on the back also 80% 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.930
 here is recycled so it is 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.890
 actually good for it too 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.110
 environment 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 but yes i am very curious to have this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 then I also have two 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 got mascara's and first is that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.329
 this one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.880
 from covergirl and for those who always 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.820
 to watch mother programs 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.619
 i only know covergirl from 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.530
 brand is next also wants them to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.390
 talk then it is principle 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.460
 you know i don't know if people do that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.500
 also know where there I know the name 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.060
 only yours never got any products from 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.120
 I am very curious to have this 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.620
 start using it and this is the blast lesson 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.929
 fusion mascara from congo 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.729
 then I have a mascara and this one 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.520
 I now up and I think it's really super fine 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.100
 and he has a little brush but still 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.930
 there is enough mascara on it 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.820
 and I think they are very nice 10 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.920
 small brush that was nice for you 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.840
 lower lashes and also just for you 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.220
 because you don't get anything about it 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.770
 your eye shadow one 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.920
 and this is the maybelline lash stilettos 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.900
 And this is water proof that this one 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.200
 super cute lip gloss it's a small one 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.060
 girl with a bow on it and this is 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.620
 from the claire and I think it's really great 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.770
 a chain is also nice that you 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.970
 can hang my keys or something 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.440
 yes i am now again from this from the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.150
 packing to go get him and really 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.730
 super nice looking then also a small 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.700
 spot of wrinkle and this is the 031 with it 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.860
 far and it's a bit brown 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.560
 tinted and it also has a pink tint 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.239
 so quite natural shades what I do 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.930
 find it very nice and usually also 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.150
 wear 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.680
 so i'm very happy with this and 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.870
 then the rest wants to be in this bag 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.549
 are all nail polishes first 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.670
 I have three different colors ourselves 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 to brand and it is brand Sally Hansen 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.070
 hard as nails extreme adversarial first 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.390
 I have a pitch-black colorful super 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.040
 am pleased because I love it to 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.480
 have black nails and then you can 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.390
 draw him nicely 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.500
 and yes my black color was almost finished 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.350
 I am really happy about this and this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.360
 it's the 370 blackout 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.280
 to such kind of my glitter and this 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.739
 is very reminiscent of the essence 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 round to information you got sick where 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.950
 super happy with it 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.670
 so i hope this one as well and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.980
 looks nicer and this is the 295 pixel 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.590
 parker and already six of the sally people 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.790
 nail polishes have the 300 drykorn 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.530
 and actually you are very curious 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.930
 because with white nail polish I like it 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820
 always very skilled because or it is 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.020
 so that you have to lower a lot 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.030
 Apply it or it looks really whole 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.230
 ugly from right or here with types about you 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.030
 beside me going 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.070
 then at least in my opinion 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.959
 are a lot of bus nail polishes so me 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.760
 I am very curious to see if this 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.040
 does work then I have two more layers 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.709
 twigs of maybelline color 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.890
 show and this is street art 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.250
 and this is what I like when we are black 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.440
 and blue glitters in super many so if 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.600
 you already have it once you have enough 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.110
 on so you don't have to go to the fish and 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.030
 this is number 52 nighttime beautiful and this one 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.669
 I can really recommend you I know completely 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.600
 not how expensive these are but I like it 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.220
 really super fine and super beautiful 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.470
 recommended and then also of maybelline color 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.540
 show got gold after luck and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.479
 this is also just gold and the sit 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.669
 rose gold glitter in with a 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.190
 something more important than clean under my 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.390
 I also look very pretty and this is 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.280

 I absolutely love my mac brand 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.890
 but I just really really like it 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.630
 expensive 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.300

 in a really super curious as if 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.830

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.150
