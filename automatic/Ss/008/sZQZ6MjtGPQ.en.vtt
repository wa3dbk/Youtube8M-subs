00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
yeah that was that that caused a little

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.969 
yeah that was that that caused a little
bit<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.119> problem<00:02:05.329> there<00:02:05.689> Montoya<00:02:06.649> was

bit of a problem there Montoya was

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.070 
bit of a problem there Montoya was
nearly<00:02:07.580> squeezed<00:02:07.909> out<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.209> think<00:02:08.539> Michael<00:02:08.959> may

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
nearly squeezed out I think Michael may
