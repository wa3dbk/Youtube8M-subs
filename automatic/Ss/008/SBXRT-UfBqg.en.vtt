00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.650 
now you get controlled of pretty much
everything<00:04:01.680> AB<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:03.000> control<00:04:03.360> almost

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
everything AB can control almost

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.509 
everything AB can control almost
everything<00:04:04.380> it's<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.250> all<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:05.989> but<00:04:06.989> I

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
everything it's not all of it but I

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.350 
everything it's not all of it but I
don't<00:04:08.519> know<00:04:08.610> if<00:04:08.730> I'm<00:04:08.850> going<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.030> be<00:04:09.150> able<00:04:09.209> to

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
don't know if I'm going to be able to

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.229 
don't know if I'm going to be able to
find<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.640> probably<00:04:11.640> probably<00:04:11.940> can't

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
find one you probably probably can't

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.360 
find one you probably probably can't
find<00:04:12.450> one<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:13.350> there's<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.680> screen

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
find one now but there's a screen

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.830 
find one now but there's a screen
capturing<00:04:14.579> app<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.120> need<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.299> route<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.570> device

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
capturing app you need to route a device

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.280 
capturing app you need to route a device
it'll<00:04:16.169> actually<00:04:16.350> capture<00:04:16.950> your<00:04:17.669> screen<00:04:18.290> which

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
it'll actually capture your screen which

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.990 
it'll actually capture your screen which
is<00:04:19.440> pretty<00:04:19.650> cool

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
is pretty cool

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.270 
is pretty cool
other<00:04:21.570> than<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.780> routing<00:04:22.440> isn't<00:04:23.160> that

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
other than that routing isn't that

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.980 
other than that routing isn't that
beneficial<00:04:23.729> on<00:04:24.030> Android<00:04:24.479> because<00:04:24.810> it's

beneficial on Android because it's

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.060 
beneficial on Android because it's
already

such a user-friendly open interface but

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.310

overclocking<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.890> big<00:04:32.190> thing<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.460> burgers

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
overclocking is a big thing that burgers

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.370 
overclocking is a big thing that burgers
do<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.470> for<00:04:35.480> basically<00:04:36.480> what<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.720> does<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.230> it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
do it for basically what that does is it

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.560 
do it for basically what that does is it
takes<00:04:37.560> your<00:04:38.300> CPU<00:04:39.950> it's<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.040> dual<00:04:41.250> core<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:42.120> you

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
takes your CPU it's a dual core so you

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.470 
takes your CPU it's a dual core so you
can<00:04:43.190> add<00:04:44.190> like<00:04:44.610> two<00:04:44.760> hundred<00:04:44.850> megahertz<00:04:45.210> to

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
can add like two hundred megahertz to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.240 
can add like two hundred megahertz to
each<00:04:45.600> one<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.530> can<00:04:46.680> make<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:46.920> go<00:04:47.040> from

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
each one and you can make you go from

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.270 
each one and you can make you go from
two<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.330> two<00:04:48.660> gigahertz<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.470> almost<00:04:49.920> two<00:04:50.130> and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
two one two gigahertz to almost two and

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.940 
two one two gigahertz to almost two and
a<00:04:50.310> half<00:04:50.430> acre<00:04:50.640> Hertz<00:04:50.850> processors<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.770> that's

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
a half acre Hertz processors so that's

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.130 
a half acre Hertz processors so that's
pretty<00:04:53.220> awesome<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.790> if<00:04:54.630> you're<00:04:54.810> wondering

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
pretty awesome and if you're wondering

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.920 
pretty awesome and if you're wondering
if<00:04:55.230> that's<00:04:55.380> safe<00:04:55.730> yes<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:56.910> is<00:04:57.000> completely<00:04:57.540> safe

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
if that's safe yes it is completely safe

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.050 
if that's safe yes it is completely safe
to<00:04:58.230> do<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.680> as<00:04:58.830> long<00:04:59.160> as<00:04:59.340> you're<00:04:59.490> only<00:04:59.610> going<00:04:59.970> up

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
to do it as long as you're only going up

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.080 
to do it as long as you're only going up
by<00:05:00.240> about<00:05:00.360> 20%<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.640> I'm<00:05:02.640> sure<00:05:02.790> people<00:05:02.820> are

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
by about 20% and I'm sure people are

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.170 
by about 20% and I'm sure people are
gonna<00:05:03.180> argue<00:05:03.390> with<00:05:03.510> me<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:04.470> when<00:05:04.910> these<00:05:05.910> CPUs

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
gonna argue with me but when these CPUs

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.570 
gonna argue with me but when these CPUs
are<00:05:06.600> made<00:05:06.810> they're<00:05:07.530> made<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.830> handle<00:05:08.190> more

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
are made they're made to handle more

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.760 
are made they're made to handle more
than<00:05:08.640> they<00:05:08.910> can<00:05:09.210> do<00:05:09.390> and<00:05:10.200> they<00:05:10.380> are<00:05:10.500> made<00:05:10.650> to

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
than they can do and they are made to

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.910 
than they can do and they are made to
handle<00:05:10.920> it<00:05:11.130> safely<00:05:12.080> but<00:05:13.080> what<00:05:13.320> companies<00:05:13.740> do

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
handle it safely but what companies do

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.630 
handle it safely but what companies do
is<00:05:14.160> they<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.900> don't<00:05:15.900> know<00:05:16.020> what<00:05:16.170> you<00:05:16.260> call<00:05:16.380> they

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
is they I don't know what you call they

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.350 
is they I don't know what you call they
like<00:05:17.640> underclock<00:05:18.240> them<00:05:18.480> almost<00:05:20.360> because

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
like underclock them almost because

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.600 
like underclock them almost because
otherwise<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:22.110> prices<00:05:22.890> would<00:05:23.040> all<00:05:23.130> just<00:05:23.340> drop

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
otherwise the prices would all just drop

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.950 
otherwise the prices would all just drop
and<00:05:23.910> they<00:05:24.030> would<00:05:24.150> be<00:05:24.270> pointless<00:05:24.570> because<00:05:24.780> you

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
and they would be pointless because you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.480 
and they would be pointless because you
could<00:05:25.080> buy<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.230> really<00:05:25.500> fast<00:05:25.770> processor<00:05:26.310> for

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
could buy a really fast processor for

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.560 
could buy a really fast processor for
really<00:05:26.640> cheap<00:05:27.230> so<00:05:28.230> they<00:05:28.260> limit<00:05:29.070> them<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.670> so

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
really cheap so they limit them and so

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.610 
really cheap so they limit them and so
they<00:05:30.660> can<00:05:30.780> still<00:05:30.990> sell<00:05:31.200> them<00:05:31.290> for<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.590> a

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
they can still sell them for like a

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.130 
they can still sell them for like a
decent<00:05:31.860> amount<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.190> money<00:05:32.340> to<00:05:33.060> companies<00:05:33.960> like

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
decent amount of money to companies like

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.940 
decent amount of money to companies like
this<00:05:35.330> so<00:05:36.330> if<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:37.110> are<00:05:37.260> gonna<00:05:37.410> overclock<00:05:37.920> it

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
this so if you are gonna overclock it

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.850 
this so if you are gonna overclock it
don't<00:05:38.730> go<00:05:38.850> more<00:05:39.030> than<00:05:39.210> 20<00:05:39.510> 25%<00:05:40.410> over<00:05:42.470> it<00:05:43.470> might

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
don't go more than 20 25% over it might

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.920 
don't go more than 20 25% over it might
might<00:05:44.400> increase<00:05:45.000> your<00:05:45.060> tablet's<00:05:45.540> temperature

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
might increase your tablet's temperature

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.050 
might increase your tablet's temperature
a<00:05:45.960> tiny<00:05:46.290> bit<00:05:46.530> it's<00:05:47.160> not<00:05:47.370> going<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.640> damage<00:05:47.820> it

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
a tiny bit it's not going to damage it

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.180 
a tiny bit it's not going to damage it
it's<00:05:48.210> not<00:05:48.420> gonna<00:05:48.540> be<00:05:48.720> noticeable<00:05:49.230> if<00:05:49.980> you

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
it's not gonna be noticeable if you

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.340 
it's not gonna be noticeable if you
start<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.700> like<00:05:50.730> 50<00:05:51.330> percent<00:05:51.690> overclocking

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
start going like 50 percent overclocking

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.500 
start going like 50 percent overclocking
so<00:05:53.130> you're<00:05:53.280> going<00:05:53.520> like<00:05:53.670> 3<00:05:53.940> gigahertz<00:05:54.180> now

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
so you're going like 3 gigahertz now

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.080 
so you're going like 3 gigahertz now
that's<00:05:55.350> dangerous<00:05:55.590> you're<00:05:56.400> gonna<00:05:56.580> fry<00:05:56.850> your

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
that's dangerous you're gonna fry your

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.990 
that's dangerous you're gonna fry your
CPU<00:05:57.600> don't<00:05:58.200> use<00:05:58.470> that<00:06:01.190> that's<00:06:02.190> pretty<00:06:02.700> much<00:06:02.820> it

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
CPU don't use that that's pretty much it

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.390 
CPU don't use that that's pretty much it
