00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
general at all but that doesn't seem to

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.320 
general at all but that doesn't seem to
be<00:04:59.780> much<00:04:59.810> of<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.200> problem<00:05:00.230> with<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.180> just<00:05:02.180> have

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
be much of a problem with this just have

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.330 
it's very easy to control as you can see
even<00:05:07.790> that<00:05:08.090> Skeletor<00:05:08.840> can<00:05:09.050> control<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:10.040> if

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
even that Skeletor can control it so if
