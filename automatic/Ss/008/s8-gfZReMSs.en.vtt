00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.780
 today I will introduce you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.340
 some finds that I found 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.070
 for Christmas in this part 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 so I found a pedia bullet 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.170
 almost new apart from the title that a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:29.910
 pact who has here so I will die the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:35.309
 tastes with it's going pretty much youth 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:41.300
 ari balogh 10 the Arab laissez-faire and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.300
 in Mexico here and the console 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.649
 if he thought I ordered on a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:59.040
 consoles site a veil to it 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:06.570
 was admitted in relief to geometry the a48 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 and that's why if then I 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.420
 found another console a little harder 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.570
 to find 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:18.960
 so I have or introduce her to her guys you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:22.800
 shakes in Japanese version was very 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.649
 hard she yes we are really not 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:31.649
 easy to find in this way there the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:39.590
 style is really thought it's both 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.590
 the person with the serial number 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.240
 I was lucky to find the games 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.079
 who are going with 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:02:04.759
 it's gone this family and if you do not 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:04.759
 dreams not harbor and again child 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.910
 there they are in couple was still 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.910
 if it's the book too much about older sarthe 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.240
 short small pockets 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 1 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:48.350
 finally 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.260
 Eval if dany what is it for that 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.690
 that I have it and very expensive 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.540
 about 80 offices etc provided with a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.360
 spare part not found the style 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.290
 of singing it's it's nine it's 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:10.820
 still the price above 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:12.770
 so here's the vub and where the end with the 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.710
 connectivity to connect directly to 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.710
 the console so that's the way for the industry 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.720
 so then I found something 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.900
 quite rare in its ranks 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.230
 several people the college dress the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.200
 robot is really perfect and has 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.910
 slightly yellowed on top in 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.590
 that's what he is an enthusiast 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:47.360
 functional but it is missing 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:51.980
 the faces here and with Jesus that the giro 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:57.940
 concluded me with the game here is the family 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.940
 we see the exit 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:11.210
 and everything needed a current that can 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:13.810
 to play or not it's not a little rabbit 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.810
 according to good 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.990
 the famous gironis you make us your and the 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.360
 second for now like that lalime 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:34.750
 sagging elastic 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:35.260
 that's why the game of various 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.150
 Documents 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:47.280
 frau the warranty is there and the support 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:52.900
 ball is to be able to play for you 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:56.770
 that's why it's the gesture accessory 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.800
 is brand new on a site of first in 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.040
 hat nor is it new hayato that I 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.220
 strongly advise to the partition of the good 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.890
 equipment 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.110
 then I found so I like the game 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.080
 is one of the most expensive in the world 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.010
 stadium events sometimes had the debate 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.750
 love it you see it here are the 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:25.620
 Savoyards delicately a game I have 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.620

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.560
 his luck and the most expensive game at 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:48.389
 world went 45 dollars on ebay a 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:55.889
 few here are second and nike for that 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:58.169
 see we see there for that it's then 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.289
 I found some consoles on 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.190
 flea markets or between the first is 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.000
 univocal 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:10.169
 there we see the state by van parra 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.319
 oxidation tips to try it 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:19.050
 in his passes and louis if you come 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.870
 to find a version a little done to 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.599
 nothing we will say with the managers 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.719
 think exactly the same year the 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:32.280
 put in here and then people 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:35.280
 everywhere and two highlights a super 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.650
 ugly too much with the box not a little 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.930
 bothered that but towards it goes over I can 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.930
 interest time there 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:50.370
 but here it is not paying full 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.040
 but not the care of studying and note that 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.810
