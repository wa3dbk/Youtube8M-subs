 tricks and none of this but a couple of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.360
 curious facts about the table 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.670

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.160

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.020
 magnificent series that has you them 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.169
 been liked good what are these 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.719
 curious data let's go with the first 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.460
 the first of levels forgiveness sorry the 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.649
 number of levels vary depending on the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.260
 position of the shelves that is 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.059
 only with 15 shelves can you 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.249
 achieve what is the maximum level that 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:52.510
 is 30 as you see here we are are 15 2 4 6 8 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:55.780
 10 12 14 and one can go there over there 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.959
 where you want another curious fact is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.420
 that many people believe that corners do not 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.519
 serving 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.610
 they put this they think you want them not 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 They serve and how they look 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.150
 you go down four levels what is like that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.340
 that the corners do serve but another 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 curious fact is that too many people 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.120
 believe that he believed he wanted forgiveness that the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.510
 shelves upstairs if they served but 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.000
 look 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 it's like they do not put anything in the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 new versions today I'm playing you in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.840
 1.7 points 5 I think it's a 1.7 point 2 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.549
 from now on it is where this does not happen anymore 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.350
 but many believe that with the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.869
 shelves above if they are added 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.480
 levels and also many believe that with 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.800
 the corner shelves 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.090
 yes yes as it is called do not serve us as 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.399
 come now in the add 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.890
 puts us on what is level 30 like this 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.619
 that only with 15 shelves can you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.710
 get to level 30 another very curious fact 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.659
 which is that the torches break the use 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.030
 from the shelves what do I mean with 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.549
 this we have a torch many of 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.649
 sure they do this to illuminate their 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.340
 shelves in areas from your house 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.790
 etcetera put this so look with a 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.920
 torch here 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.689
 now charm attempt of catÃ³n to sword 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.909
 and as you can see, it takes away all four levels 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.310
 because because this apart from that the 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.219
 torch does not use is also the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.019
 shelf below and another mini datum 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.049
 curious is that if we put a torch 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.690
 in the corner of the shelf look at what 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.660
 What's up 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.930
 Now we have level 18 because 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.260
 now this neutralizes this nonsense 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.080
 these 2 are 2 on the corner and you're 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.800
 two also neutralizes them by making 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.300
 can no longer be no longer usable 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.170
 that they can no longer absorb their power 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.470
 magic of the bookstores and also another 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.610
 curious fact is that you can 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.140
 level 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.740
 or rather how I know how to explain them 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.500
 level water at will the levels of 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.330
 experience for example I put here 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.960
 some pistons and here with a lever 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.330
 I can go dropping water jets 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.780
 as you see here so there are I think I 've passed 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.780
 a little 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.580
 here so you can release them as you see in 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.190
 neutralize also levels of 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.740
 experience so with a lever 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.150
 I can go leveling this so that a 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.319
 jet here and another here if you want a 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.230
 level 4 level 2 so look 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.480
 how many levels I want and these are 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.980
 the curious data a little data 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.930
 We believe that we wanted to be known 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.430
 if you do not know at least one leaves 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.480
 metro like for new ones that help me
