00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.230
 as what several men 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.290
 lucas and boys and now yes 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.290
 now they are heard by the striker if he figures in the game and the front 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.590
 venezuela what it does is to greet us the image that I imagine that the drug 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.879
 go through the tie over the hour 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.879
 because martino's face said it all 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.789
 it would be aberrant 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.880
 nobody would like the tie in this way and out there a minute before 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.560
 to finish the game we knew what 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.890
 panama 8 dollars that's why they must turn a match 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 a selection that is very strong too and what that out there 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 Bulk errors were committed at the last minute and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.790
 says without a doubt the duke demo 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.080
 that we were tied and crazy a bitter taste 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.450
 but hey in it we have time to correct this you have to see the positive and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.360
 the negative correct it as soon as possible because 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 we as an assignment that lavishes mind already converts so that between 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 so much tools and we know that I love it to improve for your party normally 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 one to surprise us with positively positive named as tamara cando that causes you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.200
 surprise 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 these negative things what are teams are based on defense I think that is already 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 upward open matches in the final minutes 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.730
 go ahead against Brazil went against now happens with Venezuela 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.150
 but we know that if we can correct it 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.530
 It does not work that it has happened to you now, not between commissioners and then why not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.110
 they say yes win the match 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.080
 But he did not give it to Mass that does not happen now 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.990
 that is the most important thing that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.689
 he knows that when they are converted and then not able to leave for home so 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.590
 we know that we can correct the booth stand i said task we have to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.440
 do it in the week so that it does not pass us the site of the own party does not possess 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.530
 Lucas Martino 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.800
 on the contrary he is saying he said maybe it happened to him 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.590
 just for being conditioned by what had happened against Brazil 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.440
 two or three hours 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 that begins to basora then the one that manages to follow ahead 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.800
 it could be that it did not happen because of what happened to us with brazil 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.959
 undoubtedly the tata motion 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.370
 but we also know how we did it to a boy who did not pass now 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.060
 digesa now we have no margin of error no 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.779
 now they do not pass the group and we have to try to improve it 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.759
 the tool also of heartbreak as those differences are a team that does not 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.769
 convert us 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.900
 pique we have clear of what is 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 I feel that we do have something very positive about what we say in two Wharton matches 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.469
 result 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.200
 and today crown in box utah the 3 to 1 to return 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.229
 the island is regulated regulates that we nothing is not pressure or with a 3 to 3 having 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.119
 that we had three points the hand is a good chance there will be surprises 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.309
 a big hug to all of good night
