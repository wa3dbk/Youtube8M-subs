00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
made the journey team so special is that

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.780 
made the journey team so special is that
everybody<00:03:03.290> was<00:03:03.439> really<00:03:03.739> really<00:03:04.189> personally

everybody was really really personally

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.420 
everybody was really really personally
deeply<00:03:05.329> invested<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:05.959> making<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:06.950> game<00:03:07.159> that

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
deeply invested in making it a game that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.490 
deeply invested in making it a game that
connected<00:03:07.939> to<00:03:08.090> people<00:03:08.389> and<00:03:08.900> when<00:03:09.169> that's<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
connected to people and when that's the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.080 
connected to people and when that's the
goal<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.099> game<00:03:10.129> that<00:03:10.459> you're<00:03:10.579> building<00:03:10.969> as

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
goal of the game that you're building as

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.000 
goal of the game that you're building as
opposed<00:03:11.389> to<00:03:11.450> some<00:03:11.629> other<00:03:11.659> goals<00:03:12.109> I<00:03:12.530> think<00:03:12.889> it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
opposed to some other goals I think it

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.890 
opposed to some other goals I think it
brings<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.819> place<00:03:14.000> every<00:03:14.329> day<00:03:14.629> in<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
brings you to a place every day in the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.629 
brings you to a place every day in the
dialogue<00:03:15.379> where<00:03:15.560> you're<00:03:15.680> really<00:03:15.919> focusing<00:03:16.430> on

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
dialogue where you're really focusing on

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.699 
dialogue where you're really focusing on
having<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.569> feeling<00:03:17.870> be<00:03:18.199> real<00:03:18.379> touching

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
having that feeling be real touching

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.979 
having that feeling be real touching
someone<00:03:19.129> in<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> heart<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.819> that's<00:03:20.569> what<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
someone in the heart and that's what you

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.569 
someone in the heart and that's what you
see<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.379> journey<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.979> I<00:03:22.069> think<00:03:22.280> that's<00:03:22.489> the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
see in journey and I think that's the

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.920
