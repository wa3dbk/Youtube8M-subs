 musical and I share this song this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 is when the tremor passes is a success of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.480
 this stereo and it goes with its 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.059
 guitars friends because this is going to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.630
 start now and the belts and we're going 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.000
 to take off 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.480
 ok friends that take standard tuning 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.189
 how we started 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.189
 [Music] 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:02.270
 [Music] 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.790
 address 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.510
 [Music] 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.400
 I will walk 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.659
 on the stones 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.659
 [Music] 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.030
 ok friends the chords that we have 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.370
 made for the intro are the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.610
 following the lowest major sun greater fa 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.620
 and a minor 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.530
 and the rhythm that uses us for all the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.900
 song is next 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.850
 [Music] 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.380
 it's not going to be too slow for them to 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.000
 do at home 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.800
 Y 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 i 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.250
 i 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.200
 and then you're going to do a little more 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 fast let's go up the speed 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.899
 to 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.160
 [Music] 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.970
 and they realize it's very simple 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.090
 only it is down or up you relax the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.370
 finger the agreed back up to go down and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.020
 relax the chord relatively is very 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.860
 simple and that we use for all 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.300
 the song of when the tremor passes ok 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:26.740
 we start 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.480
 [Music] 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.480
 [Applause] 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.480
 Y 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.150
 now let's move on to what's coming 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.680
 being the first verse of the song 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.790
 we're going to occupy the same chords 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.270
 that would be the beginning only 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.380
 we are going to occupy extra chords a do 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.490
 greater a fa 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.490
 a minor sun 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.099
 17 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 and is in agreement is a fan with low or in 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.310
 wash 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.140
 and from there we go to what his 17 arrive 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.740
 I know what the first stanza would be like 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.740
 I 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.450
 all right 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.430
 [Music] 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.180
 to win 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.260
 [Music] 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.209
 [Applause] 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:31.519
 [Music] 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.519
 from what I know 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.450
 [Music] 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.970
 you 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.020
 [Music] 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.030
 although already friends for the second stanza 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.800
 we use the chord modes and the same 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.660
 rhythm is the same pattern for all the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.820
 song and we enter what is being 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.060
 the choir part the chorus we use a 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.460
 my youngest and 17 I only know that I know how 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:12.379
 it would be 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:12.379
 [Music] 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.540
 ok friends but I find the co-payment for 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.060
 those for the part of the colon in addition to its 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.520
 my youngest 17 and to finish the choir 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.050
 we go to what is a C major and makes 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.290
 a little harmony on the 10th fret with 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.880
 the little finger 1 we go to 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:38.690
 12 fret to fall to D major 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.690
 again it will be very slow 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.300
 i 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:50.750
 [Music] 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.470
 and we make a fa without a nut 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.860
 [Music] 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.860
 Y 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:07.020
 then we would be in this way a 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:11.380
 crack face to face 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.170
 [Music] 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.760
 Y 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.630
 [Music] 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:24.430
 i 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:26.140
 [Music] 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.970
 although already friends study a fourth 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.070
 verse again a chorus and we went to 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:49.710
 the part of the end that would be of this 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:54.520
 form are four times in the chord of 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.100
 greater a minor re and a sustained one 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.160
 greater and nothing more the rhythms down 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.690
 is marked four times and we would 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.140
 so it's going to be very slow so that only 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.140
 can do 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:24.350
 [Music] 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.120
 and 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.280
 I hope you have served much as 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.050
