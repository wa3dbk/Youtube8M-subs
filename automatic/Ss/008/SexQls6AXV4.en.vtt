00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.660
 in the next few videos I will tell 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.509
 about the most useful applications that 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.519
 there are in windows 8 we are with you in the past 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.730
 Video reviewed here these applications here 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.370
 which run in on start 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.650
 the screen now I propose to turn my 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.420
 attention to this standard 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.660
 which windows programs are not so many 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.430
 but who are also helpful in this 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.400
 video let's talk about the program 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.999
 paint and about wordpad and notepad 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.640
 these programs they wander from the editorial board to 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:40.449
 editions of windows they were windows xp and 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.179
 windows 7 and and again windows 8 appeared 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.980
 programs about it are quite simple in 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.370
 difference from the metro application she 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.309
 runs on the desktop in this one 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.960
 In a separate window , she has a very 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.949
 limited and therefore I do not recommend 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.420
 there is always the opportunity 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.039
 take advantage of a better program 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.269
 there is a mass on the same internet 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.729
 programs that 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.340
 online can do a lot more 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.079
 rather than paint but if it suddenly arises 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600
 need to do some quite 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.399
 simple from kizik by hand or 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.979
 edit quite a bit 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.610
 some picture you can do it and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.030
 in paint 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.950
 now as for other programs 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.860
 already programs text editors 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.750
 the first one is my word pad program 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.000
 attitude towards her is basically the same as 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.460
 and to paint because it is very 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.289
 limited in its functionality can 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.780
 say it very very much 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.020
 cropped word if you know such 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.250
 the word program which has already become 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.909
 a kind of standard text 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.219
 of the editor 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.770
 then the word pad program is very, very 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.070
 the clipped word here is also all very 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 understandable and simple therefore if you want 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.299
 learn to work in a text editor 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.880
 for example such as word on my 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.490
 The site has a video course called 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.079
 microsoft word for beginners there i 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.539
 quite detailed how 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.460
 work with the program word all those very 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.100
 knowledge that there is a video course of you 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.720
 easy to implement when working 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.480
 wordpad because wordpad 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 has all the same tools the same 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.989
 very buttons 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.370
 simple and much less here and 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.040
 last program 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.269
 which is very simple this program 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.549
 notebook 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.569
 it can be very simple but really 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.629
 I really use 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.599
 fairly regularly unlike more 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.180
 difficult word milked paint and this 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.099
 the program is perfect for 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.200
 writing some simple notes in 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.849
 notepad you cannot format 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.370
 text that is you cannot change 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.920
 font of the text of his typeface do it 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.750
 bold italic or underlined ie 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.700
 This program is designed specifically for 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.620
 create the most simple notes 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.480
 I use a notebook very often 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.000
 especially in such cases 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.349
 about which I want to tell now 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 for example, I have some 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.760
 a task that I can solve with 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.099
 some specific program i find 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.109
 This program on the Internet and download 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.709
 and and the installation file to yourself on 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.599
 computer 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.269
 I usually have a folder on my computer 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.370
 distributions where I create a folder with 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.500
 program name and in this folder 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.659
 I save the installation files of this 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.459
 programs if this program a 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.049
 Using not often it was for example 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.940
 single case but I figured that 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.919
 This program is useful and can me 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.349
 need in the future then I always 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.849
 I launch a notebook and in a notebook I write 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.079
 few lines with a brief description 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.540
 of this program 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.349
 describing can be brief and functional 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.150
 or just give a link here to the site with 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.980
 I downloaded this program where 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.750
 I can read more and detailed 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.000
 description after that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.769
 text file saving in the same folder 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.549
 where do i have the installation files 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.470
 programs 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.510
 so the next time I will 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.669
 search in the distribution folder this 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.560
 the program that i need i just 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.109
 I open a text file it opens 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.790
 almost instantly and in it getting 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.449
 information about what kind of program 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.609
 what and functionality if desired if there 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.829
 There is a file link before copying this. 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.389
 I insert the link into the browser and turn to 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.209
 software developer site 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.819
 well and so on therefore notepad i 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.109
 I use it often enough and despite 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.989
 its rather limited functionality 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.989
 also recommend using it to everyone
