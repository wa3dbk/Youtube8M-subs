we took him after all fed him and it's
just<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.790> those<00:01:14.880> projects<00:01:15.390> where<00:01:15.630> it's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just one of those projects where it's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.910 
just one of those projects where it's
just<00:01:16.110> kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.710> gained<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.850> more

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
just kind of gained more and more

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
just kind of gained more and more
gravity<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.220> by<00:01:20.580> gravity<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.090> mean<00:01:21.270> weight<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
gravity and by gravity I mean weight and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.460 
gravity and by gravity I mean weight and
it's<00:01:23.299> just<00:01:24.299> before<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> interview<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it's just before this interview is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710 
it's just before this interview is
actually<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.090> reinforcing<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> struts<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
actually just reinforcing the struts you

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
actually just reinforcing the struts you
know<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.170> sure<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.860> doesn't<00:01:29.040> actually

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
know to make sure it doesn't actually

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.440 
know to make sure it doesn't actually
fall<00:01:29.850> over<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.470> third<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.369> why<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
fall over and so third one why are you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
fall over and so third one why are you
sculpting<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:35.270> challenge<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.630> always<00:01:37.790> what

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
sculpting it challenge and always what

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.600 
sculpting it challenge and always what
we're<00:01:38.939> also<00:01:39.229> sculpted<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.070> best<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.490> his

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
we're also sculpted the best of his

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.330 
we're also sculpted the best of his
ability<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> case<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
ability and I think it's a case of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.179 
ability and I think it's a case of
scaling<00:01:44.340> honking<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.110> given<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
scaling honking it's also that given the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.700 
scaling honking it's also that given the
time<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.610> mean<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.689> ridiculously<00:01:49.619> short

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
time I mean we have a ridiculously short

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.219 
time I mean we have a ridiculously short
time<00:01:50.310> scale<00:01:50.640> there's<00:01:50.909> there's<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.270> anyone

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
time scale there's there's no anyone

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.010 
time scale there's there's no anyone
who's<00:01:52.470> done<00:01:52.710> sculpting<00:01:53.640> mold-making<00:01:54.270> costume

it does seem Barney this is the quickest

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.899 
it does seem Barney this is the quickest
method<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> done<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
method to get it done and out with the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.359 
method to get it done and out with the
best<00:02:06.090> results<00:02:06.630> given<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.079> time<00:02:07.290> frame<00:02:07.369> okay

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
best results given the time frame okay

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.790 
best results given the time frame okay
so<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> next<00:02:09.720> perfect

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so what is the next perfect

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
so what is the next perfect
oh<00:02:11.030> oh<00:02:13.760> we're<00:02:14.760> gonna<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:15.030> making<00:02:15.260> fiberglass

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
oh oh we're gonna be making fiberglass

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.520 
oh oh we're gonna be making fiberglass
molds<00:02:16.880> it's<00:02:17.990> different<00:02:18.990> from<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.410> we

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
molds it's different from what we

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.460 
molds it's different from what we
usually<00:02:19.680> do<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.190> later<00:02:20.660> yeah<00:02:21.660> reason

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
usually do which is later yeah reason

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.750 
usually do which is later yeah reason
for<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:24.110> time<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:26.070> weight<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.520> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
for that is time and the weight of it is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.510 
for that is time and the weight of it is
for<00:02:27.690> anyone<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.350> anyone<00:02:28.590> who's<00:02:28.770> used<00:02:28.860> plaster

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
mold you know they weigh a fair bit you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.680 
mold you know they weigh a fair bit you
can<00:02:31.950> kind<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.220> assume<00:02:32.520> more<00:02:32.640> kind<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.000> white

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
can kind of assume more kind of white

we're going to be dealing with the only

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.050 
we're going to be dealing with the only
way<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.370> around<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.820> tues

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
way to get around that is tues

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.870 
way to get around that is tues
fiberglass<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:38.010> all<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.430> how<00:02:38.460> lovely

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
because it will plaster will decay over

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.660 
because it will plaster will decay over
time<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:50.400> resin<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.270> could<00:02:51.510> make<00:02:51.770> 50<00:02:52.770> 60<00:02:53.130> 70<00:02:53.490> of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
time but resin we could make 50 60 70 of

time but resin we could make 50 60 70 of
these<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.330> heard<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.840> them
