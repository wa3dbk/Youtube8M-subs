00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:04.510
 Good day to all today I 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.190
 has achieved 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.700
 This opportunity appeared to compare 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.809
 Lozina still take the wave not my 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.330
 wave, too, my cleaning dima serov 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.510
 I have a link in recommended 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.789
 channels, but I 'll take the link too 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.529
 subscribe to the channel reviews too 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:31.760
 knives multitool with some kind 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:35.540
 gear and now I understand that the laser 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.280
 on search is not so good because 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.829
 leatherman wave is much smaller 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.649
 it's easier for me to do this multitool 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.180
 this is the same multitools for me to do 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.530
 so not very convenient that it is big 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:53.149
 really big let's start with weight 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.379
 the weight is still sometimes the manufacturer doesn't 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.539
 correct weight or some 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.760
 online stores indicate weight 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.980
 specifically my 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:09.069
 334 and with it the tenth weight you him 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:12.709
 245 with what we get from fuji 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.329
 wedge replaceable here it is only more 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:18.249
 powerful 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:23.689
 scissors and a shift here this chick and all 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:25.729
 power sponges here here is the same he 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.759
 look like he is black it seems that 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.569
 even they are thinner on my black 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.099
 north and here they are thicker more 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.409
 rough 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:38.209
 I am very good in this position 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.840
 a little tight what I was snacking 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:44.109
 bolts which are replaceable here therefore 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.749
 don't pay attention to it 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:53.060
 well and such an addition a small video about 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:56.029
 probably all hiv as if now i see 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.529
 that you them he is really very good 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:02.630
 competitor and but still better to part a 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:05.259
 here iphone is much smaller 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.290
 let's put a ticker for the scale 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.810
 here 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 1110 one centimeter- based long 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.930
 The blades are northern here too 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.540
 by the way, pay attention 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.180
 there is a notch to distinguish the rater 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:28.630
 ny Bring reuters us here incisions 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.490
 there's very little you here 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.980
 early wedge but here on 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.840
 notch so more complete under 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.820
 thumb and to always 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.460
 feel where what the wedge 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.550
 so play a new wedge here on both 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.490
 no sign of any frills 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.810
 here there is already a difference there is 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.080
 the difference is palpable although there is not so much 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.390
 on and sensible floor centimeter literally 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.270
 no more that is the length of the blade 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.800
 we win half a centimeter and the length of the 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.680
 title increased by one centimeter then 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.890
 why it is necessary is not very clear 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.480
 internal filling of the parts here is all 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.290
 about ksari clip standards too 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.030
 you can put it on search here 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.980
 same with such tools 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.930
 screwdriver and opener on ufa 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.580
 multifunctional well, and here the same 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.950
 I'll open the website of the country right now 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.980
 tool 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.190
 Well, I think it only makes sense to say 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.030
 that scissors are hiding here hiding 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.680
 inside the handle they are outside because 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.129
 here outside one of the places occupied 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.750
 file so as here to keep the change 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.610
 This file can be put or file 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.580
 and scissors have the ability to move 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.000
 provide access outside here 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.750
 to really understand 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.150
 last point is scissors yes these 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.160
 scissors 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:17.560
 inspires fear and respect they really 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.560
 such solid and powerful and 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.070
 volts from the same in one and the other 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.770
 models access to scissors convenient i 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.330
 I met a multitool whose scissors 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.000
 when you open them closed multitool 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.850
 turned out to be inverted it so 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.479
 had to work we have everything 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.729
 clearly convenient chehobo multitool 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.020
 Here such a cover comes but I just 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:50.270
 Findings bought my case this case Excel 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.660
 the size of the largest if needed case 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.910
 for you it is possible to take the sea 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.919
 size l sea cover here dima 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.889
 to use such a case standard 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.310
 part of the kit the same cue can 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:07.070
 insert 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:10.300
 court something and court here such a comparison 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.230
 I do not see any particular advantages with the server 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.410
 I see only cons 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:20.300
 form of large size and weight also i 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.510
 shot on them the other day a month ago can 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.920
 be 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.260
 or more video or 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:33.140
 leatherman tested different canvases 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.580
 and in principle it turned out that a bit 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.000
 the holder is not so useful because 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.280
 that there is no better to be always 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.010
 standard saw 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.040
 that's what this is what leapfrog with 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.220
 replaceable files that are not always 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.170
 you are rigidly fixed that is it 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.140
 loose this standard saw with 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:59.300
 standard whips kun best was 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.930
 just here usually saw a little bit here 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.220
 a little more 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.849
 but absolutely no backlash monolithically 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.189
 solid file 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.479
 such a comparison, thank you all for 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.479
 view all bye
