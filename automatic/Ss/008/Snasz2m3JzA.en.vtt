 Let's go to the game now 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.490
 it works normally connected to the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.200
 your notebook 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.880
 the motion functions also worked 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.010
 the same without any problem 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.560
 the only thing that will not work is the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.400
 course in case you do not have a bar 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.730
 of censor 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.940
 but that you can do what you do 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 to take the bar to be common 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.800
 and tear off a cable 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 common and connects the wires more clearly than 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.630
 have to start the car right is that later 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.390
 just connect your computer and 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:20.610
 will act as the bar of being only the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.610
 own and only that prof your engine in v 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.020
