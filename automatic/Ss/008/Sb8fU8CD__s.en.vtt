cookers would it was left faster than

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.830 
cookers would it was left faster than
this<00:01:35.210> one<00:01:36.130> granted<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.189> is<00:01:37.369> my<00:01:37.520> first<00:01:37.880> it

slow and I agreed is a little slow and
that<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:52.729> one<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.090> downfalls<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.979> second

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
that is one of the downfalls the second

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.880 
that is one of the downfalls the second
downfall<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.390> unit<00:01:56.780> is<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.350> while<00:01:57.740> it's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
downfall to this unit is that while it's

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.510 
downfall to this unit is that while it's
plugged<00:01:58.130> in

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
plugged in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.210

at another unit now down to going back

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.860 
at another unit now down to going back
to<00:02:26.970> its<00:02:27.090> performance<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:28.520> actually<00:02:29.520> really<00:02:30.480> do

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
to its performance I actually really do

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110

that<00:04:19.519> i<00:04:19.579> need<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.910> add<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.419> little<00:04:20.690> bit

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
that i need to add just a little bit

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.330 
that i need to add just a little bit
more<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.530> once<00:04:21.859> you've<00:04:22.010> done<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.250> couple

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
more but once you've done it a couple

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.020 
more but once you've done it a couple
times<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:23.300> figure<00:04:23.449> it<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.800> just

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
times you can figure it out and you just

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.310 
times you can figure it out and you just
do<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.120> same<00:04:26.270> thing<00:04:26.330> each<00:04:26.600> time<00:04:26.870> after<00:04:27.050> that

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
do the same thing each time after that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.460 
do the same thing each time after that
and<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.830> makes<00:04:27.979> perfect<00:04:28.400> rice<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:30.050> I've<00:04:30.229> really

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and it makes perfect rice so I've really

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.820 
and it makes perfect rice so I've really
enjoyed<00:04:30.770> using<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.930> but<00:04:32.930> if<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.350> get<00:04:33.410> another

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
enjoyed using it but if I get another

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.640 
enjoyed using it but if I get another
one<00:04:33.949> I<00:04:34.220> probably<00:04:34.990> get<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.050> better<00:04:36.199> more

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
one I probably get a better more

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.129 
one I probably get a better more
expensive<00:04:37.130> model<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.669> bought<00:04:38.389> this<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:39.020> Amazon

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
expensive model I bought this on Amazon

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.620 
expensive model I bought this on Amazon
and<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.430> cost<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.180> believe<00:04:42.190> $24<00:04:43.389> let<00:04:44.389> me<00:04:44.449> just

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
and it cost I believe $24 let me just

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.520 
and it cost I believe $24 let me just
check<00:04:44.840> on<00:04:44.900> that

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
check on that

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.409 
check on that
yeah<00:04:46.960> $24.90<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.400> that's<00:04:49.700> that's<00:04:49.970> really

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
yeah $24.90 so that's that's really

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.990 
yeah $24.90 so that's that's really
cheap<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.169> can<00:04:51.350> make<00:04:51.590> up<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.070> 4<00:04:52.370> cups<00:04:52.729> of

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
cheap and you can make up to 4 cups of

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.090 
cheap and you can make up to 4 cups of
uncooked<00:04:53.210> rice<00:04:53.540> which<00:04:53.900> means<00:04:54.139> 8<00:04:54.410> cups<00:04:54.830> of

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
uncooked rice which means 8 cups of

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.600 
uncooked rice which means 8 cups of
cooked<00:04:55.400> rice<00:04:55.580> so<00:04:56.570> if<00:04:56.960> needed<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.530> can<00:04:57.860> make<00:04:58.370> a

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
cooked rice so if needed you can make a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.710 
cooked rice so if needed you can make a
lot<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.030> rice<00:04:59.210> with<00:04:59.540> it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.800 

another<00:05:02.720> thing<00:05:03.729> problem<00:05:04.729> not<00:05:05.510> really<00:05:05.780> a

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
another thing problem not really a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.719 
another thing problem not really a
problem<00:05:06.110> but<00:05:06.919> if<00:05:07.039> you<00:05:07.100> can<00:05:07.220> see<00:05:07.370> back<00:05:07.550> here

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
problem but if you can see back here

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.629 
problem but if you can see back here
there's<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:08.000> little<00:05:08.120> reservoir<00:05:09.160> this<00:05:10.160> collects

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
there's a little reservoir this collects

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.850 
there's a little reservoir this collects
I<00:05:10.940> think<00:05:11.240> extra<00:05:11.630> seen<00:05:12.229> which<00:05:12.500> comes<00:05:12.710> out<00:05:12.800> of

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
I think extra seen which comes out of

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.010 
I think extra seen which comes out of
here<00:05:13.220> or<00:05:13.460> moisture<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.270> drips<00:05:14.479> down<00:05:14.660> in<00:05:14.840> here

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
here or moisture that drips down in here

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.600 
here or moisture that drips down in here
problem<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:15.919> if<00:05:16.039> you<00:05:16.100> don't<00:05:16.250> clean<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.580> out

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
problem is if you don't clean that out

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.670 
problem is if you don't clean that out
right<00:05:17.270> away<00:05:17.539> it'll<00:05:17.780> get<00:05:17.930> stuck<00:05:18.139> in<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.380> bottom

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
right away it'll get stuck in the bottom

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.800 
right away it'll get stuck in the bottom
and<00:05:18.889> it's<00:05:19.010> so<00:05:19.190> small<00:05:19.250> you<00:05:19.910> really<00:05:20.479> can't<00:05:20.690> get

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
and it's so small you really can't get

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.930 
and it's so small you really can't get
anything<00:05:20.960> in<00:05:21.169> there<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.380> clean<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.910> I

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
anything in there to clean it so I

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.969 
anything in there to clean it so I
thought<00:05:23.389> that<00:05:23.570> was<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.750> problem<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:24.560> another

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
thought that was a problem and another

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.340 
thought that was a problem and another
problem<00:05:25.310> I've<00:05:25.550> noticed<00:05:26.060> is<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:26.570> this

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
problem I've noticed is that this

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.279 
problem I've noticed is that this
lettuce<00:05:27.710> started<00:05:28.130> cracking<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.960> can<00:05:29.990> see

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
lettuce started cracking you can see

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.320 
lettuce started cracking you can see
that<00:05:30.500> but<00:05:30.650> right<00:05:30.800> here<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:31.669> started<00:05:32.180> cracking

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
that but right here it started cracking

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.010 
that but right here it started cracking
see<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.389> here<00:05:35.810> as<00:05:36.289> well<00:05:40.720> so<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:41.750> didn't<00:05:41.960> get

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
see it here as well so you didn't get

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.830 
see it here as well so you didn't get
this<00:05:42.139> closer<00:05:42.470> for<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:44.979> see<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.070> right<00:05:46.220> there

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
this closer for you see it right there

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.510 
this closer for you see it right there
and<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:48.289> believe<00:05:48.860> that's<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.220> do<00:05:49.340> with<00:05:49.370> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
and I believe that's to do with the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.589 
and I believe that's to do with the
steam<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.750> pressure<00:05:51.050> inside<00:05:51.530> of<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:51.830> and

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
steam and the pressure inside of it and

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.570 
steam and the pressure inside of it and
I'm<00:05:53.599> sure<00:05:53.660> those<00:05:54.020> wouldn't<00:05:54.320> happen<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.680> more

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
I'm sure those wouldn't happen to more

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.480 
I'm sure those wouldn't happen to more
expensive<00:05:56.020> units<00:05:57.039> so<00:05:58.039> that's<00:05:58.190> quite

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
expensive units so that's quite

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.379 
expensive units so that's quite
disappointing<00:05:59.150> but<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.389> hasn't<00:05:59.840> affected<00:06:01.389> its

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
disappointing but it hasn't affected its

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.060 
disappointing but it hasn't affected its
cooking<00:06:02.960> ability<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:04.310> do<00:06:04.430> use<00:06:04.729> this<00:06:04.940> same

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
cooking ability and I do use this same

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.070 
cooking ability and I do use this same
three<00:06:07.070> times<00:06:07.099> a<00:06:07.430> week<00:06:07.639> maybe<00:06:08.000> I<00:06:08.300> do<00:06:08.690> like<00:06:08.930> my

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
three times a week maybe I do like my

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.190 
three times a week maybe I do like my
price<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:12.520> Goods<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:13.729> Bad's<00:06:14.200> performance

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
price so Goods and Bad's performance

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.279 
price so Goods and Bad's performance
wise<00:06:15.410> I<00:06:15.919> would<00:06:16.099> say<00:06:16.460> it's<00:06:16.789> mediocre<00:06:17.330> middle

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
wise I would say it's mediocre middle

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.330 
wise I would say it's mediocre middle
range<00:06:19.840> he<00:06:20.840> gets<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.169> job<00:06:21.200> done<00:06:21.409> the<00:06:22.159> rice

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
range he gets the job done the rice

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.250 
range he gets the job done the rice
comes<00:06:22.640> out<00:06:22.820> perfect

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
comes out perfect

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.220 
comes out perfect
but<00:06:24.620> it's<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.860> little<00:06:25.010> slow<00:06:25.280> I<00:06:25.840> do<00:06:26.840> like<00:06:27.110> the

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
but it's a little slow I do like the

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.130 
but it's a little slow I do like the
warming<00:06:27.590> feature<00:06:27.970> I've<00:06:28.970> made<00:06:29.330> it<00:06:29.540> for<00:06:29.690> lunch

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
warming feature I've made it for lunch

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.340 
warming feature I've made it for lunch
of<00:06:30.590> la<00:06:30.830> rice<00:06:31.160> ate<00:06:31.580> ate<00:06:32.240> some<00:06:32.510> of<00:06:32.540> it<00:06:32.750> for<00:06:33.140> lunch

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
of la rice ate ate some of it for lunch

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.930 
of la rice ate ate some of it for lunch
and<00:06:33.560> then<00:06:33.800> came<00:06:34.010> back<00:06:34.040> and<00:06:34.460> eat<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.670> rest<00:06:34.700> of

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
and then came back and eat the rest of

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.760 
and then came back and eat the rest of
it<00:06:35.090> for<00:06:35.120> dinner<00:06:35.450> and<00:06:35.660> it<00:06:35.750> was<00:06:35.810> still<00:06:36.080> warm<00:06:36.290> just

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
it for dinner and it was still warm just

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.170 
it for dinner and it was still warm just
as<00:06:36.890> if<00:06:37.040> I<00:06:37.160> had<00:06:37.310> just<00:06:37.460> made<00:06:37.640> it<00:06:37.820> so<00:06:37.940> that<00:06:37.970> was

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
as if I had just made it so that was

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.740 
as if I had just made it so that was
really<00:06:38.390> cool<00:06:38.920> build<00:06:39.920> quality<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:41.240> is<00:06:41.420> made<00:06:41.600> out

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
really cool build quality it is made out

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.960 
really cool build quality it is made out
of<00:06:41.900> stainless<00:06:42.080> steel<00:06:42.290> which<00:06:43.220> feels

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
of stainless steel which feels

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.350 
of stainless steel which feels
high-quality<00:06:44.950> hasn't<00:06:45.950> had<00:06:46.040> any<00:06:46.190> problems<00:06:46.670> but

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
high-quality hasn't had any problems but

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.950 
high-quality hasn't had any problems but
the<00:06:47.630> plastic<00:06:48.110> parts<00:06:48.440> are<00:06:48.620> are<00:06:49.220> cheap<00:06:49.960> feel

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
the plastic parts are are cheap feel

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.930 
the plastic parts are are cheap feel
cheap<00:06:51.230> and<00:06:51.470> as<00:06:52.190> you<00:06:52.310> can<00:06:52.430> see<00:06:52.580> I've<00:06:52.730> already

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
cheap and as you can see I've already

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.760 
cheap and as you can see I've already
started<00:06:53.180> cracking<00:06:53.540> and<00:06:53.930> like<00:06:54.440> I<00:06:54.470> said<00:06:54.680> I've

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
started cracking and like I said I've

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.100 
started cracking and like I said I've
had<00:06:54.920> this<00:06:55.130> for<00:06:55.460> about<00:06:56.180> a<00:06:56.360> month<00:06:56.540> actually<00:06:56.960> just

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
had this for about a month actually just

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.400 
had this for about a month actually just
a<00:06:57.170> little<00:06:57.320> bit<00:06:57.410> under<00:06:57.560> a<00:06:57.710> month<00:06:58.450> price<00:06:59.450> is<00:07:00.350> a

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
a little bit under a month price is a

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.960 
a little bit under a month price is a
great<00:07:00.830> selling<00:07:01.580> point

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
great selling point

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.320 
great selling point
I<00:07:02.030> mean<00:07:02.240> $24<00:07:03.050> is<00:07:03.380> very<00:07:03.890> cheap<00:07:04.220> they<00:07:05.000> also<00:07:05.150> have

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
I mean $24 is very cheap they also have

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.170 
I mean $24 is very cheap they also have
a<00:07:05.390> larger<00:07:05.810> model<00:07:06.340> which<00:07:07.340> basically<00:07:07.760> looks<00:07:08.000> the

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
a larger model which basically looks the

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.660 
a larger model which basically looks the
same<00:07:08.390> which<00:07:09.050> is<00:07:09.080> a<00:07:09.200> little<00:07:09.410> bit<00:07:09.500> more

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
same which is a little bit more

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.380 
same which is a little bit more
I<00:07:11.140> doubt<00:07:12.140> it<00:07:13.000> wouldn't<00:07:14.000> have<00:07:14.120> the<00:07:14.240> same

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
I doubt it wouldn't have the same

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.260 
I doubt it wouldn't have the same
problem<00:07:14.810> since<00:07:15.020> this<00:07:15.170> one<00:07:15.380> it<00:07:15.470> looks<00:07:15.650> the<00:07:15.770> same

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
problem since this one it looks the same

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.220 
problem since this one it looks the same
so<00:07:17.270> I<00:07:17.300> don't<00:07:17.420> want<00:07:17.540> to<00:07:17.570> say<00:07:17.690> it<00:07:17.780> wrong<00:07:17.960> it's<00:07:18.140> not

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.510

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.960 
a good name but I would look for a
different<00:07:20.870> type<00:07:21.020> model<00:07:21.800> or<00:07:21.980> a<00:07:22.040> different<00:07:22.790> name

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.190 
have flowers and stuff on it which I was

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.940 
have flowers and stuff on it which I was
told<00:07:40.430> that<00:07:41.030> a<00:07:41.630> lot<00:07:41.990> of<00:07:42.020> the<00:07:42.170> Asian<00:07:42.260> models<00:07:42.740> have

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950 
told that a lot of the Asian models have

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.150 
told that a lot of the Asian models have
and<00:07:43.370> that<00:07:43.670> they<00:07:43.820> are<00:07:43.970> the<00:07:44.000> best<00:07:44.300> ones<00:07:44.860> so<00:07:45.860> I

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 
and that they are the best ones so I

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.500 
and that they are the best ones so I
might<00:07:46.400> just<00:07:46.640> have<00:07:46.820> to<00:07:46.850> bite<00:07:47.120> the<00:07:47.150> bullet<00:07:47.330> and

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:47.510 
might just have to bite the bullet and

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.170 
might just have to bite the bullet and
get<00:07:47.750> one<00:07:47.870> of<00:07:47.900> those<00:07:48.020> anyway<00:07:48.410> but<00:07:49.280> for<00:07:49.550> now<00:07:49.670> this

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:50.180 
get one of those anyway but for now this

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.030 
get one of those anyway but for now this
one<00:07:50.390> works<00:07:50.600> I'm<00:07:50.900> gonna<00:07:51.110> keep<00:07:51.590> using<00:07:51.800> it<00:07:51.980> until

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.040 
one works I'm gonna keep using it until

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.810 
one works I'm gonna keep using it until
it<00:07:52.310> dies<00:07:53.110> so<00:07:54.110> if<00:07:54.410> I<00:07:54.500> have<00:07:54.590> to<00:07:54.680> give<00:07:54.800> it<00:07:54.920> a<00:07:55.040> star

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820 
it dies so if I have to give it a star

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.820 
it dies so if I have to give it a star
rating<00:07:56.150> I<00:07:56.510> would<00:07:56.780> say<00:07:56.930> it's<00:07:57.080> probably<00:07:57.200> get<00:07:57.590> two

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:57.830 
rating I would say it's probably get two

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.460 
rating I would say it's probably get two
and<00:07:57.920> a<00:07:57.950> half<00:07:58.070> three<00:07:58.370> stars<00:07:58.760> it<00:07:59.390> works<00:07:59.810> it's

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.470 
and a half three stars it works it's

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.840 
and a half three stars it works it's
cheap<00:08:00.920> but<00:08:01.670> it's<00:08:01.850> also<00:08:02.000> low<00:08:02.300> quality<00:08:02.860> I<00:08:03.860> hope

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:04.850 
cheap but it's also low quality I hope

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.480 
cheap but it's also low quality I hope
this<00:08:05.000> review<00:08:05.150> helped
