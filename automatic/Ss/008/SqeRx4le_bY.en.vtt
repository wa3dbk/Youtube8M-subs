00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.330
 Hi, everyone , welcome to the board at 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.840
 we began to study the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.660
 thin spherical lenses in this class we 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.029
 let's know the different types of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.849
 we have seen examples of 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.919
 instruments that use lenses and knots 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.399
 we know that each of these instruments 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.380
 have different functions to perform 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.500
 each of these functions 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.170
 There is a different kind of milk. Let's go. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.870
 then know these lenses all 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.450
 lenses that we are going to study has a 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.960
 very small thickness so we 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.170
 we call thin spherical lenses and 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.900
 there are lenses with even more edges 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.560
 thin the center gives milk 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.530
 in these lenses the distance from a 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.070
 compared to the other when we measured this 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.430
 distance at the ends of the lens is 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.979
 less than the thickness that the distance 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.040
 that goes from one vertex to the other of the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.890
 vertex 1 to vertex two inside the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.530
 lenses group of thin edges we 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 we found three types of lens 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.549
 the first is called a convex be 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.580
 if we imagine a point in the center of the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.850
 Lens your walk from the left to the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.290
 right you can see that she 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.470
 it's conversation 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.049
 if I walk right to the left 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.510
 besides it is also talk so this 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.869
 lens receives the name of vicky conversation 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.250
 now when one of the faces of the lens is 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:49.930
 convex and the other face is flat the lens 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.590
 is called convex plane lens ok 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.369
 we will then classify this third 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.880
 lens 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.860
 if I send from left to right 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.729
 from the center of the lens 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.580
 we touch a surface that is 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.489
 concave if I go the other way 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.860
 walking now from right to left 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.090
 we find a surface that is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.900
 conversation 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.790
 now let's call this face easy and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 That 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.109
 cid facci 2 if we determine the radius 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.549
 of curvature for these two faces a 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:33.120
 radius of curvature for face 11 radius r 1 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.439
 will be less than the radius of curvature for 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.129
 face 2 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.189
 in this example the face with cava 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.870
 It has a greater radius of curvature than the 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.250
 face talk 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.370
 so the name for excellent will be 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.420
 concave and convex now the lenses also 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.510
 may have thick edges and 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.840
 that the distance between the faces when 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.980
 we measure this distance in 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.950
 end of the lens is larger than the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.200
 thickness similarly in this group in 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.870
 that lenses have good of expenses 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.049
 we have three different types of 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.329
 lenses the first lens is the lens 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.919
 concava because following the same reasoning 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.919
 that our enemies 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:26.549
 before walking from the center of the 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:29.400
 lens towards the two faces 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.400
 that we found are faces with cavas 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.370
 in the second case there is a face that is 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.669
 concave and a face that is flat then 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.479
 this lens here is the flat lens with 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.510
 to dig 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:45.540
 following the rationale of the radius 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.510
 of curvature of the two faces in the case 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.010
 that the two faces of the lens are curved 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.310
 being one with cava and a conversation in this 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.510
 example you will realize that the radius of 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.879
 curvature of the face that is conversation is greater 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.810
 that the radius of curvature of the face 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:11.129
 This concave lens receives the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.159
 convex lens name now concave 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.709
 You already know the laws we can already 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.590
 study the behavior of a radius of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.590
 light when it passes through a lens 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 but this from the next class 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 do not lose
