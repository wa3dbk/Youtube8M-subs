00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:33.070
 Hi everyone, my name is Stefano Calabrese 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.070
 and I attended the cisco ccna course 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.420
 I currently live in Berlin and work in 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 a company that deals with building 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.110
 aerospace materials and components e 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.110
 I'm lighty assistant 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.040
 I found this 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.710
 also thanks to the ccna certificate of ho 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.200
 achieved at the school vega after 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 only three months I could find 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.110
 this position given relative indeed 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.110
 very interesting 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 the course was 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.770
 very informative learned a lot of 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.320
 things at a practical level and at a level 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.030
 theoretical also because it is a 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.980
 200 hour course 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.070
 we also did a few hours of 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.070
 extraordinary in more then it is 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.470
 a really vast subject and 200 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.970
 hours maybe they even seem 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.340
 may be few for the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.340
 vastness of the topic to be treated 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.599
 the course developed in learning e 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.120
 I found no difference 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.930
 compared to a course developed in one 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.840
 normal class indeed I must say I am 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.910
 found very well the fact of being able to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.950
 follow the course from your own 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.959
 home is really very comfortable 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910
 especially for those who still work and 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.800
 so you don't have much time for gods 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.800
 shifts especially in big cities 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.409
 during the course 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.129
 the ability to get your hands between 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:53.470
 quotation marks remotely on cisco device 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.510
 as routers and switches and certainly beyond 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.060
 to be very stimulating as it is not 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.549
 it's about putting your hands on only one 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.640
 simulator or on a photograph 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.819
 internet signs but on a cisco router 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.609
 on a real cisco switch and it was 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:15.760
 really very productive instructive in 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:20.049
 how much mistakes made on a machine 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:25.739
 real rice is found was in a manner 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.739
 more physical than say 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.600
 I found myself 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.760
 also good with teachers who are always 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.950
 been available at any time 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.780
 even outside the course at the time 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.960
 where we had doubts o 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.940
 however, some unclear things 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.620
 we could communicate via email 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.050
 without problems we have always received 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.380
 maximum support from this point 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.380
 of view 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:17.250
 I am definitely taking a course in 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.459
 linux ministre tor and and before 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.970
 expiry of the three years follow also the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.100
 corso cisco security as 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.500
 represents another fundamental step 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.720
 towards the achievement of the position 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.720
 job I aspire to 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.740
 thanks for everything 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.900
 asked this interview see you 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.900
