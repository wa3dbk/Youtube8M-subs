voice as well as the game um you can do
that<00:03:13.500> without<00:03:13.620> threat<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.489> probably<00:03:15.180> most

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that without threat to and probably most

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.210 
that without threat to and probably most
other<00:03:15.810> ones<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.440> might<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.769> find<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
other ones you might have to find a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.470 
other ones you might have to find a
different<00:03:17.250> code<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.970> find<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.330> voice

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
different code to find the voice

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.110 
different code to find the voice
loopback<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.140> different<00:03:19.380> games<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> think

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
loopback for different games but I think

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.640 
loopback for different games but I think
this<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.330> pretty<00:03:21.510> Universal<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> most
