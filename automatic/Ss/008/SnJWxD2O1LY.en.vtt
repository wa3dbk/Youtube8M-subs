always like to look at the poll numbers

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.440 
always like to look at the poll numbers
in<00:03:19.230> particular<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.250> harris<00:03:21.030> poll<00:03:21.239> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
in particular that the harris poll and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.819 
in particular that the harris poll and
the<00:03:21.540> coaches<00:03:21.900> poll<00:03:22.079> because<00:03:22.260> those<00:03:22.620> are<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the coaches poll because those are the

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.759 
the coaches poll because those are the
most<00:03:23.269> stable<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.019> that's<00:03:25.230> two-thirds<00:03:25.620> of

most stable and and that's two-thirds of

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.890 
most stable and and that's two-thirds of
the<00:03:25.860> formula<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.640> that's<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.209> most<00:03:27.390> important

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the formula so that's the most important

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.569 
the formula so that's the most important
part<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> formula<00:03:28.530> they<00:03:29.100> actually<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.549> a

part of the formula they actually have a

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.330 
part of the formula they actually have a
