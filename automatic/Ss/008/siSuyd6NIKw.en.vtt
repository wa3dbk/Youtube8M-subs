about<00:03:47.810> taking<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.260> number<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.560> laps<00:03:48.769> left<00:03:49.040> in

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
about taking the number of laps left in

about taking the number of laps left in
the<00:03:49.280> race<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.430> just<00:03:49.790> divided<00:03:50.180> in<00:03:50.540> two<00:03:50.840> we're

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
the race and just divided in two we're

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.320 
the race and just divided in two we're
making<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.500> pit<00:03:51.530> stop<00:03:51.739> then<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.580> think<00:03:53.180> that's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
making a pit stop then I think that's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.640 
making a pit stop then I think that's
why<00:03:53.480> these<00:03:53.540> guys<00:03:53.780> are<00:03:53.989> maybe<00:03:54.140> stopping<00:03:54.470> a

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
why these guys are maybe stopping a

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.350 
why these guys are maybe stopping a
little<00:03:54.890> bit<00:03:55.010> shy<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.640> when<00:03:55.940> they<00:03:56.180> could

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
little bit shy of when they could

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.420 
little bit shy of when they could
actually<00:03:56.629> stretch<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.410> final<00:03:57.830> needle<00:03:58.160> number

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
actually stretch the final needle number

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.220 
actually stretch the final needle number
