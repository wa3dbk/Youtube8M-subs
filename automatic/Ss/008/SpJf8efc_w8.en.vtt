00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 learn in this video how to divert said 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.299
 that xote called the script I am 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.130
 from here and if you do not give there and in this 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.300
 video the tank will sink your 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.300
 next 10 rands 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.939
 And then the lab's vision 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.619
 how are you 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.480
 some time ago I said a little 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.910
 on trailer mechanics 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.800
 so let's revisit this theme a bit 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.450
 Did you know that you do not call fla jens all? 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.970
 the characters and objects they have a 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.770
 same box against docking but in case you 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.110
 I still do not understand let's give a 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.879
 small quick example there is a box 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.160
 around all the monsters and champions 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.440
 of all abilities are as if 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.300
 It was a square that is cuadrado 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.370
 touch the opponent's box to your 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.070
 ability to be a pull shoot 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.320
 mystic will hit and cause damage and c 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.479
 The point is that the box will not always 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.970
 be equal to the size of the character so 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.610
 as a sword square also not then 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.070
 It's good to understand every shot and every 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 character box for example the gothic 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.360
 that barely has boxes bigger than the one that comes 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.130
 sad then you do not have any 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200
 defect from playing bad field 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.970
 taking all possible chances or 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.890
 You can more by deflecting everything. 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.390
 be sure these champions there are boxes 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.040
 what makes it so 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.340
 different from the difficulty of opponents 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.290
 in aiming at them then it will be worth more 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.600
 still for champions of support that are 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.790
 such as listing or tanks as 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.860
 Rene CTAM voted that further grows 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.810
 crisis can of kant that already has good 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.640
 understanding that we have a sense of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.770
 that certain screenshots and have a box 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.690
 small as is the case of the beautiful spear 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.580
 law that is harder to hit and others 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.800
 with a gigantic box as is the case 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.230
 of pulling by frank what gives the most 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.180
 boxes that are in great working 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.960
 easy for you to be hit by anyone 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.909
 from both 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.650
 it is also important to know the trajectory 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.840
 said the shock you want to divert 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.180
 because they all have a speed of 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.520
 a specific box so if you take 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.260
 too much blitz noise is good you focus on 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 to divert blitz looks 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.860
 then in time you will notice that it will 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.330
 making it easier to divert from others who 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.879
 the xote with smaller trailers 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.280
 Finally we go there for you to divert you have 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.530
 that take into account two things the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.299
 first is the prediction of movement that is 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.310
 something very important if you want 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.319
 launch a screenshot hit because not 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.120
 nothing else you play a screenshot o 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.459
 Dude, that's when you walk out. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 and automatically divert 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.940
 now if the opponent is 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040
 moving in a specific direction and 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 it gets much more predictable easy to hit 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.280
 always keep this in mind 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.780
 movement is important both for 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 divert how much for you to hit 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.690
 mobility 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.400
 on the other hand also has animation of the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.230
 character that is the second thing 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.910
 important that you have to kill a lot of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.350
 I think people try to divert 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.390
 ability when it is already in the air 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.980
 there is a bit of a beast because you think you have 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.840
 attempted to dodge a bullet after 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.630
 She was stopped when you're impossible. 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.520
 but every action of pulling the trigger will look 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.680
 you will also not involve a time 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.709
 go then this idea people you go 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.840
 divert it before and not after you do not 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.700
 will depend only on your reflection all the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.070
 they have an animation like this. 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.990
 some of our larger mobility and 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.000
 lower if you start paying 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.680
 attention on the champion eg pizza 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.720
 when he threw hulk and gets a little 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 to a place how to divert 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.520
 well it 's like it 's like you're keeping 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.810
 always straight and predictable when 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.060
 you're not here the enemy champion 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.860
 is carrying his skill you 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.840
 abruptly changes that path to 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.820
 and this will cause it to be 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.660
 virtually all flat not 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.180
 it's against you 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.160
 then without even knowing where the shot 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.870
 you're going to end up skewing this is a 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.070
 way of using one's own life 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.930
 against himself 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.730
 The more you remember the scope of 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.190
 all the easier skills will be 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.049
 for you to deviate from them but here the ideal 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.209
 is that we focus only on these two things 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.049
 prediction of movement and animation of the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.549
 character 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.590
 so you always have to walk in line 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.450
 straight and when the enemy stops a bit and 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.580
 I'm in range for a lot of refinement 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.340
 the path and will make him err 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.290
 almost 99% of the shots do not know if 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.060
 goes well then yes you will depend on your 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.950
 then try to use the flash 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.870
 any ability of the champion as in the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.430
 diversion case he can use the transaction 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.410
 to escape any skill 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.570
 always try to deflect with the movement 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.500
 but if the video shot happens you do not 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.080
 got away 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.220
 then try to use a flash ability 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.450
 and any ability of any 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.370
 champion that you have the exam 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.959
 Another important thing, people do not 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.300
 Hide behind the boys, I gotta 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.919
 avoid being hit someone like hear is 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.620
 much more interesting than the enemy 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.660
 spend his appeal in the human case and 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.820
 time to recharge at the attempt to hit 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.950
 than you end up being put up against 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.720
 dying wall is not won because 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.790
 you took instead of serving yourself 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.800
 beach that I spoke up there he had 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.000
 this problem it must have more or less 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.920
 but not enough to use three times 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.660
 calls if he spends these three servings 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.430
 from the beginning of the game you practically 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.380
 completely annulled his presence in the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.300
 remembering that this video is more focused 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.040
 in law n did in the tim fight is a little 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.720
 different because there you will have to 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.090
 pay attention to several things at 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.130
 same time for example where the action 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.440
 we still dunno that double the 33 to 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.170
 at the same time all these things they will 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.040
 to weigh much more 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.960
 so if you want to train 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.550
 I specifically recommend that you 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.620
 play on time because she's kind of chaotic 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.210
 so the ideal is to focus on an enemy 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.980
 specific at a time 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.720
 You're playing against love for 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.669
 example of pimples you have to stay 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.610
 away from love principally and not from 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.680
 abc them the domain of the top understood but 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.780
 Yes, of love because if we hit and 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.270
 Engaged and you there was already your game 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.280
 I always rock an enemy and try 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.900
 do the skills in you wrong 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.610
 principle you may even die a lot 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.710
 even with this tip but with time you 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.240
 I'm going to divert everything I'm sure of it. 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.190
 Thank you very much Brazil, one more video of the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.900
 The lab is aimed at people until the next 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.280
 do not forget to give comment you there is 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.050
 you're new to the channel to sign up 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.550
 same as always people any doubt 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.690
 back answering in comments 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.690
 I see until the next video 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.800
 the tension in several things at once 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.480
 for example from the last moody daecheong 's 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.060
 and at the same time all these 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.900
 things will weigh much more 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.900
 already at home no 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.649
 ae
