00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.160 

I've<00:00:39.000> used<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:41.090> eyes<00:00:42.090> upon<00:00:43.460> plastic<00:00:44.460> filler

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
I've used some eyes upon plastic filler

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.299 
I've used some eyes upon plastic filler
which<00:00:46.170> comes<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:47.989> hardener<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.820> first<00:00:51.090> is

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
which comes with a hardener the first is

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.580 
which comes with a hardener the first is
use<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.520> 80<00:00:53.789> grit<00:00:54.410> sandpaper<00:00:56.180> where<00:00:57.180> they

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
use an 80 grit sandpaper where they

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
use an 80 grit sandpaper where they
where<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> hollow<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:02.989> mix<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
where the hollow was and then mix the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.630 
where the hollow was and then mix the
epoxy<00:01:06.110> with<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> hardener

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
epoxy with the hardener

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.020 
epoxy with the hardener
I'm<00:01:09.910> fill<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.600> holes<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:14.590> them

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I'm fill the holes and then with them

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:28.370 
I'm fill the holes and then with them
just<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:18.900> 220<00:01:19.900> great<00:01:20.850> paper<00:01:21.850> which<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.510> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.380 

there<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.470> go<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.880> 220<00:01:32.970> grip<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:37.030> lightly

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
there you go so 220 grip just lightly

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.480 
there you go so 220 grip just lightly
sand<00:01:38.050> it<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.770> won't<00:01:41.950> get<00:01:42.100> all<00:01:42.340> the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
sand it and then you won't get all the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.219 
sand it and then you won't get all the
contours<00:01:43.000> out<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.810> it

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
contours out of it

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
contours out of it
and<00:01:45.300> then<00:01:46.300> if<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:46.960> get<00:01:47.110> some<00:01:47.380> plastic<00:01:49.020> primer

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and then if you get some plastic primer

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.090 
and then if you get some plastic primer
okay<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:52.150> you<00:01:52.330> use<00:01:52.540> some<00:01:52.720> plastic<00:01:52.900> primer<00:01:53.440> and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
okay if you use some plastic primer and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.330 
okay if you use some plastic primer and
if<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:54.970> build<00:01:55.240> up<00:01:55.510> several<00:01:56.050> coats<00:01:56.380> just<00:01:56.890> over

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
if you build up several coats just over

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.540 
if you build up several coats just over
where<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.700> hole<00:01:57.880> was<00:01:59.670> okay<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.910> then<00:02:02.550> lightly

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
where the hole was okay and then lightly

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.609 
where the hole was okay and then lightly
very<00:02:04.000> lightly<00:02:04.420> sand<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.560> with<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.369> 220<00:02:07.060> grit

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
very lightly sand it with this 220 grit

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.650 
very lightly sand it with this 220 grit
and<00:02:09.179> you'll<00:02:10.200> you'll<00:02:11.200> see<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.800> term<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:13.540> will

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and you'll you'll see this term it will

and you'll you'll see this term it will
disappear<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:16.060> edges<00:02:19.380> where<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.410> filler<00:02:20.769> is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
disappear the edges where the filler is

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.820 
disappear the edges where the filler is
and<00:02:21.550> disappear<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.440> would<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.560> put<00:02:23.739> your

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
and I'm going to spray this so when this

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.890 
and I'm going to spray this so when this
has<00:02:34.690> got<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> five-inch<00:02:35.380> draft<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:37.720> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
from here and that's where the line will

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.570 
from here and that's where the line will
be<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.860> hope<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.310> like<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:03.129> then<00:03:04.129> once
