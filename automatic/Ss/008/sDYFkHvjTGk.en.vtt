fun<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.380> more<00:03:44.620> success<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.220> had<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.880> more

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
fun and the more success we had the more

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.390 
fun and the more success we had the more
improvements<00:03:46.989> we<00:03:47.170> made<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.769> more<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.010> wanted

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
improvements we made the more I wanted

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.150 
improvements we made the more I wanted
to<00:03:48.610> keep<00:03:48.820> trying<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> could<00:03:50.260> get<00:03:50.590> that

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
to keep trying so that I could get that

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.650 
to keep trying so that I could get that
level<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.610> performance<00:03:51.940> out<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.390> because<00:03:52.510> I

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
level of performance out of it because I

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.140 
level of performance out of it because I
think<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:53.080> very<00:03:53.140> doable<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.709> just<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.160> think

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
think it's very doable you just I think

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.000 
think it's very doable you just I think

double-check<00:04:32.330> your<00:04:32.539> phone<00:04:32.780> for

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
double-check your phone for

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.719 
double-check your phone for
compatibility<00:04:33.590> because<00:04:34.129> it<00:04:34.340> does<00:04:34.490> use

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
compatibility because it does use

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.670 
compatibility because it does use
bluetooth<00:04:35.300> smart<00:04:35.689> or<00:04:35.990> whatever<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:36.439> you<00:04:36.529> have

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
bluetooth smart or whatever so you have

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.439 
bluetooth smart or whatever so you have
to<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:36.979> a<00:04:37.159> newer<00:04:37.610> bluetooth<00:04:38.029> chipset<00:04:38.300> on

to have a newer bluetooth chipset on

but<00:04:39.650> overall<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:39.979> think<00:04:40.129> tailor<00:04:40.639> toys<00:04:40.849> did<00:04:41.120> a

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
but overall I think tailor toys did a

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.119 
but overall I think tailor toys did a
great<00:04:41.539> job<00:04:41.569> of<00:04:42.020> delivering<00:04:42.169> what<00:04:42.710> they<00:04:42.860> said

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
great job of delivering what they said

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:44.890 
great job of delivering what they said
they<00:04:43.279> would<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.669> do<00:04:44.090> still<00:04:44.479> think<00:04:44.689> there<00:04:44.810> are

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
they would I do still think there are

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.119 
they would I do still think there are
some<00:04:45.050> things<00:04:45.199> that<00:04:45.289> could<00:04:45.499> improve<00:04:45.740> though<00:04:45.979> I

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
some things that could improve though I

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.469 
some things that could improve though I
mean<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.340> would<00:04:46.580> love<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.999> see<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> beefed-up

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
mean I would love to see a beefed-up

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.089 
mean I would love to see a beefed-up
version<00:04:47.749> with<00:04:48.229> a<00:04:48.259> more<00:04:48.469> powerful<00:04:48.680> motor

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
version with a more powerful motor

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.309 
version with a more powerful motor
and/or<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.849> bigger<00:04:50.389> battery<00:04:50.689> for<00:04:51.050> longer

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
and/or a bigger battery for longer

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.379 
and/or a bigger battery for longer
flights<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.740> mean<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:51.949> hope<00:04:52.129> they<00:04:52.370> continue<00:04:52.879> to

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
flights I mean I hope they continue to

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.850 
flights I mean I hope they continue to
invest<00:04:53.659> our<00:04:53.840> energy<00:04:54.050> resources<00:04:54.199> into<00:04:54.740> this

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
invest our energy resources into this

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.309 
invest our energy resources into this
idea<00:04:55.129> because<00:04:55.249> I<00:04:55.310> think<00:04:55.490> it's<00:04:55.580> really<00:04:55.729> cool

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
idea because I think it's really cool

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.510 
idea because I think it's really cool
but<00:04:57.319> I<00:04:57.349> also<00:04:57.560> think<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.979> out-of-the-box

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
but I also think the out-of-the-box

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.369 
but I also think the out-of-the-box
experience<00:04:59.180> could<00:04:59.509> be<00:04:59.539> a<00:04:59.689> bit<00:04:59.930> better<00:05:00.110> the

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
experience could be a bit better the

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.379 
experience could be a bit better the
manual<00:05:00.770> is<00:05:00.919> excellent<00:05:01.490> but<00:05:01.909> their<00:05:02.120> site

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
manual is excellent but their site

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.570 
manual is excellent but their site
navigation<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.169> poor<00:05:03.529> and<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.279> is<00:05:04.430> the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
navigation is poor and so is the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.429 
navigation is poor and so is the
organization<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.330> their<00:05:05.419> tutorial<00:05:05.960> videos<00:05:06.229> on

their<00:05:06.560> YouTube<00:05:06.889> channel<00:05:07.250> which<00:05:07.370> made<00:05:07.550> things

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
their YouTube channel which made things

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.730 
their YouTube channel which made things
a<00:05:07.879> little<00:05:08.000> bit<00:05:08.180> more<00:05:08.389> difficult<00:05:09.229> for<00:05:09.319> me<00:05:09.590> as<00:05:09.710> a

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
a little bit more difficult for me as a

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.980 
a little bit more difficult for me as a
novice<00:05:10.189> user<00:05:10.400> than<00:05:11.029> they<00:05:11.210> needed<00:05:11.449> to<00:05:11.569> be<00:05:11.689> I

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
novice user than they needed to be I

novice user than they needed to be I
mean<00:05:12.319> here's<00:05:12.590> here's<00:05:13.039> a<00:05:13.099> couple<00:05:13.310> of<00:05:13.460> examples

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
mean here's here's a couple of examples

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.399
