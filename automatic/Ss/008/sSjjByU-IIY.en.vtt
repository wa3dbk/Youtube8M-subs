00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.670
 A greeting guardian is good precious day 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.580
 today on earth but it has 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.439
 come realize that here it never rains or 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.390
 It is always sunny or it is afternoon 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.189
 night tomorrow but it never rains in the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.810
 earth hey is curious in his previous in 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.760
 venus good nonsense aside I'll copy you 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.859
 this video because we are going to make a 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.379
 section in the channel that is going to be 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.150
 questions and answers then how 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.379
 we are going to do it because very simple we are going 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.760
 a in this video for example 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.650
 you can put your questions in the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.820
 comments but I would like mostly 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.220
 what do you do in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 when from a certain time to 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.350
 through twitter because he's going to 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.050
 starting this video is going to be the first 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 that we announce the questions and answers 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 but I'm not going to make a video always 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.450
 to announce questions and answers 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 but you're already making two videos per 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.979
 each question and answer then is 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
 convenient to subscribe to the account 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 of destiny universe twitter and to me 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.460
 twitter account because out there is 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 where are we going to go announcing the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 questions and answers in this first 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.270
 we will remove them when we have 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.060
 enough interesting questions 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.179
 and I do not know I hope he stays here a week 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.880
 we can make a pretty video 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.950
 promising why we do this because 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 very simple because I see that many of 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.759
 you still have six questions that 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 I think they should be very clear to 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.549
 this stage of play 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.709
 but hey there are maybe some 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.420
 who had bought the game recently 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.229
 you have tried the demo any 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.729
 story so it 's good in the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.819
 description of the video I leave the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.130
 twitter links subscribe is 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.989
 Attentive to the announcement of questions and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.119
 answers and you already know guardians is a 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:01.119
