00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 two cylinders two mufflers 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:24.350
 one-arm swing superbike handlebar looks like this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.350
 just a motorcycle from ducati monster 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.660
 the two- wheeled scary object has been drifting ever since 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.579
 1993 his mischief 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.309
 but the driver has to fear 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.510
 The forest was by no means the monster 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.760
 always a reliable partner 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.820
 Whenever the road was unsafe too 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.820
 do 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.359
 for everyone else understands because the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.190
 ease with the bike from curve 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.190
 Swinging to curve is exemplary 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.930
 the equipment typical ducati 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.659
 The grid frame welds cleanly 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.670
 forms the backbone around it are none 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.440
 Components adjust brakes from brembo 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 and chassis parts from schober &amp; sachs 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.160
 who chooses the s variant even bounces 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.100
 with even finer responding Ã¶hlins 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.420
 components 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.070
 Similar to harley-davidson 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.350
 Ducatisti on her bike with 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.530
 optikpark a personal note too 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.530
 miss 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.670
 From a technical point of view there is for it 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.560
 no reason the series bike drives quasi 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 from the box impeccable 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.890
 the road is fed up with the handling 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.880
 Slightly the brake packs strong but 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 not snappy too 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.319
 95 ps push the 187 kilo light bike 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.999
 sovereign out of the curve 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.780
 the performance is soft and good 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.780
 calculable 1 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.409
 with these virtues is recommended the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.680
 monsters for skiers as well as for 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.680
 beginner 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.920
 the latter should be of the big naked one 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.370
 sister of the monster but rather the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 leave your finger 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.010
 her name is program 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.780
 street fighter 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.480
 that's exactly how she drives aggressively 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.480
 hungry for tilt and swing 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.100
 she demands her pilot but gives it 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.130
 also so much back 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.530
 namely power in total abundance 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.730
 an ultra stable racing suspension from the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.730
 superbike 11 98 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.970
 Everything about the street fighter is good 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.750
 enough to get on the race track 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.220
 lie remarkable lap time 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.170
 Of course many can do that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.510
 Motorcycles but the ducati streetfighter 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.709
 manages the balancing act between racing machine 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.540
 and road bike technically they can be 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.879
 on it as a knitted 11 98 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.560
 Designate the swingarm is longer around 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.989
 Soon more stability will be added to the bike 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.099
 to lend 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.290
 casually the driver lolls behind the driver 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.480
 narrow tank the wide handlebar lies 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.220
 close to the upper body a perfect 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.220
 Arrangement and speedy motorcycle drive 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.500
 at 155 ps, she remains only 15 horses 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.500
 behind the superbike back 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.180
 whoever fully experiences the tap experiences that 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.940
 rode on the cannonball 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.860
 pauli is included though that is 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.390
 Suspension geometry designed so that 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.550
 even when hard accelerate that 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.090
 front wheel on the ground but remains in the 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.090
 power 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.270
 in the brake zone destroy the 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.640
 flammable substances speed with all 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.780
 Hardiness the snappy grab like the 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.780
 experienced sportsman 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.500
 as already mentioned for beginners is the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.330
 streetfighter not appropriate in a 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.380
 never untapped will be the potential of 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.380
 to use ducati 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.440
 but who has the necessary driving experience 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.090
 has engaged with the street fighter 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.280
 motorcycle under the butt with him 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.280
 is at the forefront everywhere
