dead cat or life cat well that means

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.270 
dead cat or life cat well that means
that<00:00:05.130> observation<00:00:05.520> determined<00:00:06.480> existence<00:00:07.280> so

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
that observation determined existence so

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.259 
that observation determined existence so
you<00:00:08.340> know<00:00:08.550> left<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.809> very<00:00:10.130> horrible

existence of a cat or the cat is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.170 
existence of a cat or the cat is
simultaneously<00:00:24.269> dead<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.080> lie<00:00:26.180> both

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180

simultaneously dead and a lie both
alternatives<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:28.490> mind-blowing<00:00:30.019> both

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
alternatives are mind-blowing both

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.459

alternatives shake philosophy to the
very<00:00:34.680> core<00:00:35.480> let's<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> first

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
very core let's take the first

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.500 
very core let's take the first
alternative<00:00:38.059> observation<00:00:39.059> determines

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
alternative observation determines

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
alternative observation determines
existence<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.800> observations<00:00:41.489> requires

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
existence but observations requires

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540 
existence but observations requires
consciousness<00:00:42.590> therefore<00:00:43.590> consciousness

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
consciousness therefore consciousness

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.279 
consciousness therefore consciousness
makes<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.940> observation<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
makes an observation and then we see the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:46.850 
makes an observation and then we see the
cat<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> alive

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
cat is alive

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.970 
cat is alive
well<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.260> determine<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> fact<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.649> cat<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
well I determine the fact that cat is
