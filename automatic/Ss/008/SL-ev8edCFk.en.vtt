00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
like our elite pro panels where the main

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.490 
like our elite pro panels where the main
benefit<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:18.359> aesthetic<00:00:18.869> requirements

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
benefit is the aesthetic requirements

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.230 
benefit is the aesthetic requirements
that<00:00:19.650> it'll<00:00:19.920> meet<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.640> other<00:00:20.760> words<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.060> looks

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
that it'll meet in other words it looks

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.259 
that it'll meet in other words it looks
good<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> work<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.609> most<00:00:24.029> any

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
good and it's going to work in most any

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.240 
good and it's going to work in most any
situation<00:00:24.930> where<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> aesthetics<00:00:26.070> are<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
situation where the aesthetics are a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
situation where the aesthetics are a
demanding<00:00:26.760> requirement<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.619> might<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
demanding requirement so it might be a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130 
demanding requirement so it might be a
benefit<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.880> show<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> things

about<00:00:38.700> our<00:00:38.910> pro<00:00:39.120> panels<00:00:39.510> how<00:00:40.170> clean<00:00:40.620> our<00:00:41.190> edges

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
about our pro panels how clean our edges

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
about our pro panels how clean our edges
were<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.030> how<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> where<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> where<00:00:43.469> the

were and how the where the where the

were and how the where the where the
seams<00:00:43.860> were<00:00:44.100> where<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> fabric<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.329> wrapped

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
seams were where the fabric was wrapped

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
seams were where the fabric was wrapped
was<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.230> clean<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> tight<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.160> no<00:00:47.309> phrase

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
was very clean and tight with no phrase

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
was very clean and tight with no phrase
as<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.960> competitor's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
as you can see from this competitor's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.000 
as you can see from this competitor's
product<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> same<00:00:51.270> can't<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.629> said<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:52.199> it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
product the same can't be said it's it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
product the same can't be said it's it's
already<00:00:53.340> starting<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> fray<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.449> four

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
already starting to fray at all four

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
already starting to fray at all four
corners<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.430> it<00:00:56.430> wouldn't<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.760> long<00:00:56.789> before

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
corners and it wouldn't be long before

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
corners and it wouldn't be long before
this<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.780> wouldn't<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.350> good<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this really wouldn't look so good on the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
this really wouldn't look so good on the
wall<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.359> paying<00:01:00.570> good<00:01:00.780> money

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
wall and when you're paying good money

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
wall and when you're paying good money
for<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.500> appearance<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.039> something<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:03.180> want

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
for the appearance of something you want

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.670 
for the appearance of something you want
to<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:03.539> sure<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> hold<00:01:04.439> up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to make sure that it's going to hold up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.490 
to make sure that it's going to hold up
for<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> long<00:01:05.189> term<00:01:05.900> as<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
for the long term as you can see some of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
for the long term as you can see some of
these<00:01:07.590> other<00:01:07.680> panels<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.549> exhibit<00:01:08.939> some

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
these other panels they all exhibit some

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.999 
these other panels they all exhibit some
form<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:11.360> less-than-perfect<00:01:14.000> construction

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
form of less-than-perfect construction

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.270 
form of less-than-perfect construction
the<00:01:17.009> oral<00:01:17.310> x<00:01:17.460> products<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> real<00:01:18.810> clean

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
the oral x products have a real clean

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
the oral x products have a real clean
tight<00:01:20.280> corner<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
tight corner and with this one you can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
tight corner and with this one you can
see<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> fabric<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:24.030> kind

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
see that the fabric is really just kind

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
see that the fabric is really just kind
of<00:01:24.270> tucked<00:01:24.509> underneath<00:01:25.189> not<00:01:26.189> only<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.549> but

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of tucked underneath not only that but

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.520 
of tucked underneath not only that but
from<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> front<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.140> clearly<00:01:28.409> see

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
from the front you can clearly see

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.630 
from the front you can clearly see
through<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> fabric

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
through the fabric

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.310 
through the fabric
but<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.659> edges<00:01:31.200> stand<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:32.009> clearly

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
but these edges stand out very clearly

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
but these edges stand out very clearly
and<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and that's not just just not going to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.940 
and that's not just just not going to
give<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> very<00:01:36.150> uniform<00:01:36.689> appearance<00:01:36.990> if

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
give you a very uniform appearance if

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
give you a very uniform appearance if
you<00:01:38.130> were<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> line<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> number<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> these<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.299> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you were to line a number of these up on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
you were to line a number of these up on
the<00:01:39.570> wall<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.049> wouldn't<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> nice

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the wall you wouldn't really get a nice

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
the wall you wouldn't really get a nice
tight<00:01:41.610> crisp<00:01:42.000> installation<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> would

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
tight crisp installation like you would

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.630 
tight crisp installation like you would
with<00:01:44.070> our<00:01:44.220> beveled<00:01:44.549> panels<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.890> finally

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.880 

you<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.790> again<00:01:51.090> look<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.710> lack<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you can again look at the lack of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
you can again look at the lack of
precision<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.670> terms<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> way<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> fabric

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
precision in terms of the way the fabric

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.499 
precision in terms of the way the fabric
is<00:01:55.140> wrapped<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> oral<00:01:56.759> x<00:01:56.909> panels<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> we

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
is wrapped in the oral x panels that we

looked at the fabric goes across the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
panel and it's wrap very tightly in this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.889 
panel and it's wrap very tightly in this
case<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.829> kind<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.130> soft<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
case it's kind of soft in here and it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
case it's kind of soft in here and it
gives<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.439> collapses<00:02:08.009> which<00:02:08.489> means<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
gives and collapses which means that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.790 
gives and collapses which means that
when<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.149> wrap<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> fabric<00:02:09.869> across<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
when they wrap the fabric across here it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.460 
when they wrap the fabric across here it
doesn't<00:02:11.069> give<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> nice<00:02:11.700> crisp<00:02:12.150> corner

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
doesn't give you a nice crisp corner

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.030 
doesn't give you a nice crisp corner
so<00:02:14.370> again<00:02:14.610> we're<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:14.790> trying<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:16.040> disparage
