00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.960
 I work with a garment like I'm going 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.460
 working with the shirt is a bit the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.930
 excuse to teach a lot of theory and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.670
 I promise you for the next class 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.920

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.440
 last crushed it becomes use the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 which joaquim no no no no baby the ya 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.170
 He was crushed on the body film

 of the latest fashion in ladies clothes for its 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.980
 but hey ask him to be as it is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.980
 how do I know how to draw 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.590
 Today we have the traditional collar on 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.750
 camillero I do in my classes if 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.270
 we hear some tips in the days 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.130
 of how to take measures for a people 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 because there is a bit of the secret of 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.480
 put because who happens if I contributed a 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.760
 neck that fits me guy with respect 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.130
 to the cleavage of the neckline and they are not going to 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.300
 power they will not be able to know 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.910
 they'll even have to pucker 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.280
 a little bit good to drink the gap of 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.040
 neckline and when shipped gap 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 neckline always makes like a pucker that 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.270
 the bad are not removed or with the iron 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.550
 the arias then is a piece of advice that 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.400
 I will give if I take with the centimeter 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.680
 stopped look at the gap measurement of the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.320
 spot I'm going to take half a neck 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.080
 half of the back and the front 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.729
 look for that when we draw a 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.040
 neck we draw with the folded paper at 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.000
 half I start with a line in 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.460
 squat with the tenderloin and I'm going to take 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.460
 notice this measure with the centimeter 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.909
 stopped and always be my means 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.770
 with 7 I'm going to take eight centimeters 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.830
 I always add a few millimeters more 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.930
 that way I'm going to have a neck 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.030
 which is a little bit bigger than the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.560
 gap then and of course we're going to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.360
 also have a meeting picket 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.090
 for the shoulder line that is to say that if 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.110
 I half an eight centimeters measure I take it 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.180
 here and he marked me at eight centimeters the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.730
 first picket that picket is very 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 important because then when we go to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.110
 sew the neck we start from here 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.870
 we get to the shoulder we get to the other 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.230
 shoulder and we get to the other end because 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.360
 what happens the whole neckline is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.370
 what remains to us like the 10 look 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.640
 then it is very easy to stick a lug 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.890
 cited and reach the size of the neck that 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 it is rigid that it has interlining that is not 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.410
 move us if they cut it the same with the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.330
 exact measurement always always always 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.880
 It seems like a mandinga thing but when they go 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.410
 to the neck machine is small and 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.870
 you have to start in to see the neckline 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.890
 because only by putting a hand on 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.530
 the machine like it has a little bit of 10 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 and it fits then we take the measure 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.410
 with the centimeter stopped more always 234 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.630
 millimeters more as rounding towards 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.270
 more and the same thing I do later with the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.010
 forward and notice that I'm going to take 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.270
 with the centimeter paradito aperture 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.420
 reached to see here if 12 with 6 I go to 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.350
 take 13 centimeters I give 4 millimeters 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.020
 of more and here I have where the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.660
 neck strap is because the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.610
 I draw the straight strip many people 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.459
 draw the straight pull a lot of people that 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.060
 does not know of precision in molderÃ­a draw 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.930
 a straight line even in in shirt shop 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.230
 of men I've seen 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.269
 if the neck the neck of the person 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.129
 out a cylinder would be perfect 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.930
 cut a straight strip but the neck 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.760
 it's not a cylinder it's like the base of a 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.709
 cone then we have to give it a 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.079
 little bit like the base of a 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.480
 cone so that we know that neck is 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.480
 hit if I what cut it totally 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.660
 straight when he fastened the neck of 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.640
 mouth a little 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.130
 then how much are we going to have 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.980
 that raise that strip a centimeter and 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.010
 medium and notice what they are going to draw well 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.100
 I round it well as if it were the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.280
 I'm losing a cone 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.860
 long and now as if it were a 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.340
 tape the width that you have four 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.500
 four and a half five three and a half here 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.210
 I give a little secret the fat ones that I do not 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.110
 I know none 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.360
 gates chubby and we have much better 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.510
 even for man in general the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.000
 half finite neck band of 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.860
 two and a half centimeters because that we 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.920
 does that when we have even the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.380
 tie we see less has rested that 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.920
 if I wear a high collar and 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.180
 I have no neck seems that I have 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.450
 then it is always advisable to 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.070
 youngest one more bajita neckband them 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.520
 has and will be figure and makes the neck 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.590
 it looks more clear is secret little secret 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.480
 of cut then I'm going to give you go 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.180
 to assume three and a half centimeters of 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.120
 wide not true then I'm drawing 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.990
 centimeters and a half 3 and nerves 3 and 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.780
 half as if it were a tape look like 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.940
 if it were a tape when they are going to cut 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.600
 the tape does not short so I cut it in 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.060
 squad and square with the base of the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.780
 neck look there's where I'm going to cut 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.740
 the tape and this I draw it well redondito 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.350
 the tip of the mango chick where 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.530
 live local and the button notice that when 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.229
 I take the measurements of the neckline do not take 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.199
 to the center I took to the center more 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.900
 the crossing is to say I came to the edge of the 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.039
 shirt then 1 centimeter and a half 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.479
 for inside because we had a 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.020
 centimeter and half of crossing 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.900
 there I have the center of the button look 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.539
 there I draw the center of the button and the buttonhole 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.030
 which is a horizontal eyelet as it goes 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.560
 center for inside 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.419
 from the center of the button inwards 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.210
 because I always say that the buttons 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.880
 they have the damn habit of leaving in 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.770
 the eyelets that are horizontal and go to 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.050
 the tip of loja happened to me once in 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.990
 a company is good that we had done 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.270
 to 20 buttons when we are pulling 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.889
 they made more eyelets and all the 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.680
 buttons always be careful where 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.659
 we want the button inwards for the 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.729
 drawing of loja and that is the human neck 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.409
 there we have the first part after 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:45.509
 the next class we will continue with the 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.509
 another part the neck part that doubles 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.949
 we continue with the neck to 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:56.909
 entertain us I do not want to finish well the 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.909
 collar shirt the good sr 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.030
 good and now we 're going to a cut and 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.960
 we continue with painting on canvas and 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.960
 Cold porcelain
