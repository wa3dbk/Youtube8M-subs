00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and praise songs this is the way that I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
and praise songs this is the way that I
found<00:00:41.940> by<00:00:42.420> far<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> most<00:00:43.500> effective

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
found by far to be the most effective

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
found by far to be the most effective
way<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.160> teach<00:00:44.430> kids<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> problem<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
way to teach kids that the problem that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.330 
way to teach kids that the problem that
most<00:00:47.039> teachers<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.320> will<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:50.219> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
most teachers have is they will make it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
most teachers have is they will make it
way<00:00:50.640> too<00:00:50.700> complicated<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.980> kids

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
way too complicated and we all know kids

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
way too complicated and we all know kids
attention<00:00:53.879> spans<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.300> many<00:00:54.629> adults<00:00:55.110> could

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
attention spans like many adults could

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
attention spans like many adults could
myself<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.910> limited<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

and over g c e minor d and here's the
way<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.790> taught<00:01:18.060> those<00:01:18.299> four<00:01:18.600> chords<00:01:18.900> G

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
way I was taught those four chords G

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.510 
way I was taught those four chords G
see<00:01:22.479> D<00:01:23.479> minor<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.579> D<00:01:25.579> okay<00:01:27.100> that's<00:01:28.100> good<00:01:28.310> and

see D minor and D okay that's good and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.710 
see D minor and D okay that's good and
that's<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.759> way<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.880> play<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.210> chords<00:01:29.479> but

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
that's the way to play the chords but

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.990 
that's the way to play the chords but
the<00:01:29.810> problem<00:01:30.290> with<00:01:30.409> that<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:31.430> took<00:01:31.790> me

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
the problem with that it took me

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.779 
the problem with that it took me
probably<00:01:32.299> two<00:01:33.200> years<00:01:33.229> just<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:34.250> learn<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.640> go

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
probably two years just to learn to go

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.460 
probably two years just to learn to go
to<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.030> C<00:01:35.299> chord<00:01:35.330> quick<00:01:35.930> enough<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.200> play<00:01:36.439> a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
to the C chord quick enough to play a

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.350 
to the C chord quick enough to play a
song<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.369> can<00:01:37.399> see<00:01:37.640> my<00:01:37.789> hands<00:01:38.030> are<00:01:38.149> going<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
guitar and then it forms this climbing

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.169 
guitar and then it forms this climbing
chord<00:01:43.810> C<00:01:44.810> very<00:01:45.289> difficult<00:01:45.979> for<00:01:46.640> perfect<00:01:46.970> for<00:01:47.149> a

continue so basically you can see the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.150 
continue so basically you can see the
first<00:04:23.000> step<00:04:23.230> especially<00:04:24.230> as<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.350> parent<00:04:24.740> make

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
first step especially as a parent make

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.440 
first step especially as a parent make
