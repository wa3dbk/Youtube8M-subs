00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.430
 hello today I bring you this makeup for 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.950
 valentine in which the eyes we carry 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.410
 an emboque there is olive green and the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.060
 lips a passion red I also hate the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.500
 action to take it a little bit more 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.000
 clear or more discreet 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.789
 so you want to leave me like comment 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.140
 Underneath telling me what you're up to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.060
 apart if you already want to end up with a 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.919
 beautiful look I recommend that you 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.929
 stay until the end of the video because 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.390
 I'm going to put a little bit of the hairstyle that 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.050
 perform in my friend monica macaco come 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 let's start 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 come on it goes yellow we do not apply this 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.079
 shadow between pink and gold on the eyelid 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.079
 mobile and below the eyebrow bone 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.770
 now the olive green the main color 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.710
 of our garlic makeup we are going to 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.260
 apply on the mobile eyelid and we're going to 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.570
 climb up to the crease and blur very 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.390
 well and then we're going to catch the same 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.210
 shadow and we're going to move a line 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.110
 along the lower lashes 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 to frame our look 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.060
 although a dark color is not so much 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.010
 like the black with which it will not be 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.120
 a very marked makeup or very 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.310
 exaggerated 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.310
 now to blur we are going to use 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.040
 this color and we will apply it for 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.610
 above the fold of the eyelids 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.610
 blurring very well 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.350
 ah 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.790
 so as not to mark the eye too much, let's 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.920
 use this olive green eye pencil 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.250
 also to delineate us the line of 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.250
 Water 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.800
 mascara all you want 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.800
 but that there are not going to be lumps 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.939
 Y 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.119
 once we finish with the eyes we go 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.549
 with the face first we are not going to 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.030
 contour using these powders 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.679
 sun let's perform a test that starts 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.069
 from the bone of the cheekbone 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.430
 then go up to the temple and go down to the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.430
 jaw 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 in this case to light up our face 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.790
 I like to use powdered formulas and that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.409
 have no glitter or glitter 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 we want a more natural result and 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.030
 then a little rouge 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.330
 for lips you have several options 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.540
 one of them is that you use 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.000
 just petroleum jelly or cocoa other than 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.370
 use a more natural tone and if you already 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.879
 you want something more daring then we go with 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.879
 the Red 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.430
 and in the end to decant by the lips in 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.220
 red I recommend that you first 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.099
 profiles with a pencil and then the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:09.489
 paint with the bar that yes always 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.489
 be fixed and ready that you think 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.030
 and now the macaco monkey hairstyles 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.739
