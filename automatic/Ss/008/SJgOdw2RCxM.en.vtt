00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.269
 in today's video we will show how 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.850
 fix a valve or small box of a 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.920
 tap to avoid leakage or leakage 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.130
 of continuous water that is produced by the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.260
 wear or damage of it in this case 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.450
 in particular the constant drip that 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.760
 comes from our tap is given by a 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.710
 wear of material or damage in 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.110
 a very small element called 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.170
 valve or popularly known as 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.449
 little body to be able to make the change of 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.260
 one of these valves you need the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.600
 following screwdriver elements 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.780
 tongs or keys and the valve or the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.270
 spare body first we proceed to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.430
 close the general key of the water this 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 key is the one that supplies the whole home 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.860
 of water and comes from abroad then 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.380
 we remove the screw that holds the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.590
 crank the stem and remove the 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.590
 crank 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.309
 we removed a coverage stage 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.689
 next we develop the shank 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.990
 to be removed from the body of the 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.990
 tap 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.600
 then we remove the screw that holds the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.600
 rubber to the valve and replace it 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.100
 in rock we give the stem to the body of the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.110
 tap we put the cover cover to then 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.110
 the crank and screw it 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.350
 ah 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.399
 to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.270
 we open the general water key and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.640
 we check that the tap does not present more 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.430
 leaks or leaks 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.650
 and well with this we conclude this video 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.409
 that shows how to fix a little picture of 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.300
 valve of a water tap in only about 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.300
 how many steps and in a very simple way
