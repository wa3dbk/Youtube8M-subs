QuickStart guide which tells you on one

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.970 
QuickStart guide which tells you on one
page<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> little<00:02:30.269> bit<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:31.019> safety<00:02:31.470> instructions

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
page a little bit of safety instructions

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.369 
page a little bit of safety instructions
and<00:02:32.549> what<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.819> should<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.569> for<00:02:33.989> example

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
and what you should do for example

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.199 
and what you should do for example
charge<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.069> first<00:02:35.280> time<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.879> quite

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
charge it for the first time and quite

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.890 
charge it for the first time and quite
nicely<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> day<00:02:37.079> on<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:38.010> bottom<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:38.370> have

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
nicely for a day on the bottom we have

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.530 
nicely for a day on the bottom we have
8.5<00:02:39.900> 1<00:02:40.349> watt<00:02:40.560> hours<00:02:40.799> your<00:02:41.069> built-in<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.540> 2300

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
8.5 1 watt hours your built-in or 2300

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.420 
8.5 1 watt hours your built-in or 2300
milliamps<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.230> that's<00:02:43.739> why<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.010> only<00:02:44.099> 80%

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
milliamps and that's why it's only 80%

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.520 
milliamps and that's why it's only 80%
and<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> works<00:02:45.299> only<00:02:45.480> with<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> Samsung

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
and it works only with the Samsung

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.470 
and it works only with the Samsung
Galaxy<00:02:46.560> s4<00:02:47.040> since<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.730> course<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> buttons

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
Galaxy s4 since of course the buttons

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
Galaxy s4 since of course the buttons
and<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.660> sizes<00:02:49.140> everything<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.709> made

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and the sizes everything and made

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.039 
and the sizes everything and made
perfectly<00:02:50.849> for<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.450> can<00:02:51.599> see<00:02:51.750> us<00:02:51.900> on

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
perfectly for this and you can see us on

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.660 
perfectly for this and you can see us on
the<00:02:52.109> back<00:02:52.319> on<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.040> inside<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.489> some

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
the back on the inside we have some

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.119 
the back on the inside we have some
rubber<00:02:53.849> feet<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.049> back<00:02:55.620> cover<00:02:55.859> does

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
rubber feet and so the back cover does

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.069 
rubber feet and so the back cover does
not<00:02:56.340> get<00:02:56.519> scratched<00:02:56.849> here<00:02:57.120> by<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.599> plastic

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
not get scratched here by the plastic

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.449 
not get scratched here by the plastic
which<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.500> course<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.829> scratchy<00:02:59.160> at<00:02:59.340> all

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
which is of course not scratchy at all

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.369 
which is of course not scratchy at all
but<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.760> there's<00:02:59.970> any<00:03:00.180> dust<00:03:00.420> going<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.230> for

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
but if there's any dust going in for

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.979 
but if there's any dust going in for
example<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:02.160> could<00:03:02.340> scratch<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.060> back<00:03:03.690> cover

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
example it could scratch the back cover

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.069 
example it could scratch the back cover
so<00:03:04.290> sliding<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.280> smartphone<00:03:05.730> in<00:03:06.079> that's

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
so sliding the smartphone in that's

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.960 
so sliding the smartphone in that's
quite<00:03:07.260> easy<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.549> have<00:03:08.700> also

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
quite easy like that and you have also

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.849 
quite easy like that and you have also
here<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.299> side<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.540> little<00:03:09.780> bit<00:03:09.900> M<00:03:10.200> space<00:03:10.650> we

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
here on the side a little bit M space we

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.190 
here on the side a little bit M space we
can<00:03:11.040> put<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.879> table<00:03:12.510> like<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
can put it on the table like this and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.909 
can put it on the table like this and
add<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> screen<00:03:13.980> will<00:03:14.190> not<00:03:14.370> hit<00:03:15.709> beyond<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
add the screen will not hit beyond the

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.580 
add the screen will not hit beyond the
on<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.430> table<00:03:17.880> directly<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.139> can<00:03:19.410> really

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
on the table directly so you can really

just<00:03:19.709> put<00:03:19.859> it<00:03:20.040> down<00:03:20.160> like<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.669> don't

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
just put it down like that and you don't

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.159 
just put it down like that and you don't
have<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.090> worry<00:03:21.510> about<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.900> screen

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
charging 68% which is of course quite

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.680 
charging 68% which is of course quite
nice<00:03:49.560> now<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.370> size<00:03:50.549> comparison<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.329> example

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
nice now in size comparison for example

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.559 
nice now in size comparison for example
to<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> Apple<00:03:52.200> iPhone<00:03:52.430> f5<00:03:53.430> with<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.299> multi

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
case you can see here it's of course

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.710 
case you can see here it's of course
bigger<00:03:56.669> since<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> smartphone<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.569> bigger

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
bigger since the smartphone is bigger

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.390 
bigger since the smartphone is bigger
but<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.049> also<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.319> little<00:03:58.410> bit<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.799> thicker

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
but it's also a little bit and thicker

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.280 
but it's also a little bit and thicker
since<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.060> battery<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:01.190> 50%<00:04:02.190> bigger<00:04:02.730> and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
since the battery is 50% bigger and

thing

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
thing

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.259 
thing
all<00:04:10.470> people<00:04:10.919> tell<00:04:11.099> me<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.879> just<00:04:12.120> a

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
all people tell me that this is just a

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.780 
all people tell me that this is just a
really<00:04:12.720> no<00:04:12.959> unattractive<00:04:13.709> phone<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:14.609> this

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
really no unattractive phone with this

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.879 
really no unattractive phone with this
little<00:04:15.060> case<00:04:15.269> but<00:04:15.510> actually<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.139> think<00:04:16.260> and

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
little case but actually I think and

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.830 
little case but actually I think and
it's<00:04:17.099> really<00:04:17.459> handy<00:04:17.789> even<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.479> having<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.750> in

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
it's really handy even for having it in

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.180 
it's really handy even for having it in
your

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
your

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.039 
your
it's<00:04:19.430> not<00:04:19.610> too<00:04:20.030> big<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.269> not<00:04:20.420> bigger<00:04:20.720> than<00:04:20.780> my

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
it's not too big it's not bigger than my

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.230 
it's not too big it's not bigger than my
wallet<00:04:21.290> em<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:22.130> would<00:04:22.310> say<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.820> course<00:04:23.000> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
wallet em I would say it's of course a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.210 
wallet em I would say it's of course a
little<00:04:23.540> bit<00:04:23.660> long<00:04:23.900> then<00:04:24.470> but<00:04:24.680> otherwise<00:04:24.890> it

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
little bit long then but otherwise it

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.830 
little bit long then but otherwise it
works<00:04:25.370> actually<00:04:25.700> perfectly<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.720> you're

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
works actually perfectly and if you're

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.020 
works actually perfectly and if you're
really<00:04:26.960> going<00:04:27.650> out<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.040> lot<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.700> don't<00:04:28.730> worry

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
really going out a lot you don't worry

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.520 
really going out a lot you don't worry
so<00:04:29.330> much<00:04:29.390> about<00:04:29.510> how<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:29.900> looks<00:04:30.020> like<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.440> it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
so much about how it looks like and it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.290 
so much about how it looks like and it
gives<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.800> also<00:04:30.980> protection<00:04:31.520> if<00:04:31.640> you<00:04:31.760> drop

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
gives you also protection if you drop

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.090 
gives you also protection if you drop
your<00:04:32.330> phone<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.320> think<00:04:33.530> will<00:04:33.680> happen<00:04:33.830> that

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
your phone and I think will happen that

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.400 
your phone and I think will happen that
it's<00:04:34.490> scratch<00:04:35.000> protected<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.020> can<00:04:36.050> also

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
it's scratch protected and you can also

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.580 
it's scratch protected and you can also
drop<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.890> and<00:04:37.280> form<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.760> few<00:04:38.290> nanometers<00:04:39.290> you

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
drop it and form a few nanometers you

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.760 
drop it and form a few nanometers you
should<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.920> course<00:04:39.950> only<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:42.440> should<00:04:42.620> not

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
should of course only you should not

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.270 
should of course only you should not
drop<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.490> for<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:45.260> purpose<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.800> course<00:04:45.830> and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
drop it and for on purpose of course and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.580 
drop it and for on purpose of course and
but<00:04:46.910> he<00:04:47.060> adds<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.330> little<00:04:47.480> bit<00:04:47.570> protected<00:04:48.380> there

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
but he adds a little bit protected there

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.200 
but he adds a little bit protected there
otherwise<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:49.400> have<00:04:49.520> here<00:04:49.670> on<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.760> bottom<00:04:50.090> of

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
otherwise we have here on the bottom of

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.570 
otherwise we have here on the bottom of
course<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.600> cutout<00:04:51.050> for<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.410> microphone<00:04:52.370> and
