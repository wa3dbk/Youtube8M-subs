00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
while um some are like so combining

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.170 
while um some are like so combining
these<00:01:09.050> three<00:01:09.680> are<00:01:11.170> um<00:01:12.430> which<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.550> awesome<00:01:14.000> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
these three are um which is awesome and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.180 
these three are um which is awesome and
then<00:01:16.420> these<00:01:17.420> two<00:01:17.750> seem<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:18.590> they<00:01:18.830> want<00:01:19.070> to

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
then these two seem like they want to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.580 
then these two seem like they want to
come<00:01:19.399> by<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.030> then<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:21.170> some<00:01:21.410> in<00:01:21.530> the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
come by on and then there's some in the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.380 
come by on and then there's some in the
back<00:01:21.770> they<00:01:22.070> are<00:01:22.280> trying<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:23.060> go<00:01:23.149> through<00:01:25.390> these

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
two um so that's pretty awesome mostly

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.969

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
looks larger like the ones in the back

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.230 
looks larger like the ones in the back
um<00:01:36.259> like<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.340> majority<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.880> ones<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
um like the majority of the ones in the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.570 
um like the majority of the ones in the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
know what I realized I realized that my

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.029 
know what I realized I realized that my
locks<00:01:50.509> actually<00:01:52.060> are<00:01:53.060> kind<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:54.039> manipulating

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
locks actually are kind of manipulating

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.529 
locks actually are kind of manipulating
the<00:01:55.220> way<00:01:55.369> that<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:55.640> used<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.000> do<00:01:56.090> my<00:01:56.209> hair<00:01:56.239> when<00:01:56.509> I

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
the way that I used to do my hair when I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.910 
the way that I used to do my hair when I
was<00:01:56.630> loose<00:01:56.899> natural<00:01:57.050> will<00:01:57.380> put<00:01:57.500> my<00:01:57.590> hair<00:01:57.770> in

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
was loose natural will put my hair in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.219 
was loose natural will put my hair in
twists<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.520> braids<00:01:59.440> I<00:02:00.670> used<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.819> do<00:02:01.970> my<00:02:02.090> hair

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
twists and braids I used to do my hair

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.490 
twists and braids I used to do my hair
like<00:02:03.229> bigger<00:02:03.979> twists<00:02:04.489> or<00:02:04.670> bigger<00:02:05.630> braids<00:02:06.020> in

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
like bigger twists or bigger braids in

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.100 
like bigger twists or bigger braids in
the<00:02:06.860> back<00:02:07.099> night<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:07.550> big<00:02:07.789> not<00:02:08.599> typically

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
the back night this big not typically

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.320 
the back night this big not typically
but<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.770> will<00:02:09.860> typically<00:02:10.280> be<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.610> larger<00:02:11.209> in

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
but it will typically be like larger in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.690 
but it will typically be like larger in
the<00:02:11.390> back<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:11.930> um<00:02:12.489> smaller<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
the back and then um smaller in the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.660 
the back and then um smaller in the
front<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> don't<00:02:14.180> know<00:02:14.270> if<00:02:14.450> that's<00:02:14.720> because

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
front so I don't know if that's because

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.559 
front so I don't know if that's because
it's<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.819> going<00:02:16.970> with<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.180> same<00:02:17.360> pattern

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
it's just going with that same pattern

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.600 
it's just going with that same pattern
or<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:18.020> happened<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.680> be<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> coincidence<00:02:18.890> but

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
or just happened to be a coincidence but

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.550 
or just happened to be a coincidence but
I<00:02:19.819> don't<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.150> there's<00:02:20.450> such<00:02:21.230> thing

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
I don't really think there's such thing

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.030 
I don't really think there's such thing
as<00:02:21.970> coincidences<00:02:22.970> not<00:02:23.599> anymore<00:02:23.870> anyway<00:02:24.050> um<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
as coincidences not anymore anyway um so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
as coincidences not anymore anyway um so
that's<00:02:28.640> my<00:02:28.879> theory<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.390> also<00:02:29.599> but<00:02:30.500> here's

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
that's my theory on it also but here's

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.940 
that's my theory on it also but here's
kind<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> mullet<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.520> little<00:02:31.760> bit<00:02:32.950> just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
kind of like a mullet a little bit just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.650 
kind of like a mullet a little bit just
in<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.190> fact<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.760> partying<00:02:35.360> back

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
in the fact that like this partying back

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.990 
in the fact that like this partying back
business<00:02:36.470> or<00:02:36.560> harvesting<00:02:37.310> they<00:02:37.520> said<00:02:37.760> you

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
business or harvesting they said you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660 
business or harvesting they said you
know<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.810> thought<00:02:39.319> about<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.770> like<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.370> free

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
know I thought about that like it's free

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.280 
know I thought about that like it's free
