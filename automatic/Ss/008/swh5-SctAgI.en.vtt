now the thing you have to watch out what
the<00:00:06.490> sustain<00:00:07.490> pedal<00:00:07.519> is<00:00:08.149> notes<00:00:08.870> ringing<00:00:09.260> into

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
the sustain pedal is notes ringing into

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.440 
the sustain pedal is notes ringing into
each<00:00:09.920> other<00:00:12.820> so<00:00:13.820> that's<00:00:13.969> two<00:00:14.330> up<00:00:14.480> running<00:00:16.450> you

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
each other so that's two up running you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.890 
each other so that's two up running you
don't<00:00:17.660> want<00:00:17.840> that<00:00:17.990> sound<00:00:18.289> it's<00:00:18.470> buckling<00:00:19.900> see

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
don't want that sound it's buckling see

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.630 
don't want that sound it's buckling see
the<00:00:21.170> notes<00:00:21.380> are<00:00:21.530> running<00:00:21.830> it<00:00:21.920> that's<00:00:22.160> holding

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
the notes are running it that's holding

the notes are running it that's holding
down<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:23.060> pedal<00:00:23.420> too<00:00:23.900> long<00:00:25.210> time<00:00:26.210> it

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.680 

so<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:50.860> can<00:00:51.100> even<00:00:51.340> do<00:00:51.460> it<00:00:51.610> fast<00:00:51.910> like<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.480> one

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
so you can even do it fast like that one

okay just next panel which will be the
middle<00:01:19.130> pedal<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.610> called<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.210> sostenuto

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
middle pedal is called the sostenuto

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.430 
middle pedal is called the sostenuto
pedal<00:01:21.410> or<00:01:21.560> base<00:01:22.040> sustain<00:01:22.850> like<00:01:23.810> different

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
pedal or base sustain like different

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.620 
pedal or base sustain like different
pianos<00:01:24.800> have<00:01:25.010> different<00:01:25.460> places<00:01:26.090> where<00:01:26.480> it

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
pianos have different places where it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
the notes ringing together this requires

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.680 
the notes ringing together this requires
you<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.590> use<00:01:39.620> two<00:01:40.160> pedals<00:01:40.580> at<00:01:40.790> once<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.420> first

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
you to use two pedals at once the first

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.840 
you to use two pedals at once the first
we'll<00:01:41.930> use<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.800> base<00:01:42.980> sustained<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> show

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
we'll use a the base sustained to show

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.640 
we'll use a the base sustained to show
you<00:01:43.910> how<00:01:44.120> it<00:01:44.240> works<00:01:44.390> now<00:01:44.660> if<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.200> play<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.560> up
