somewhat<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.740> cigar<00:01:04.280> shape<00:01:04.579> to<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.479> it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
somewhat of a cigar shape to it but it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.060 
somewhat of a cigar shape to it but it
looks<00:01:05.689> like<00:01:05.750> someone<00:01:06.020> just<00:01:06.290> snipped<00:01:06.619> off<00:01:06.740> both

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
the smoke demonstrator is just a little

the smoke demonstrator is just a little
bit<00:01:31.010> darker<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.430> this<00:01:31.670> video<00:01:31.970> than<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.299> is<00:01:32.510> in

real<00:01:32.900> life<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:34.100> at<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.430> back<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.850> pen<00:01:35.060> we

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
real life here at the back of the pen we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.820 
real life here at the back of the pen we
can<00:01:35.360> get<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.510> good<00:01:35.720> look<00:01:35.780> at<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.260> piston<00:01:36.650> knob

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
can get a good look at the piston knob

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.399 
can get a good look at the piston knob
now<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.670> little<00:01:37.970> bit<00:01:38.120> small<00:01:38.510> but<00:01:38.990> thanks

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.350 
now it's a little bit small but thanks
to<00:01:39.530> how<00:01:39.680> easy<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.430> operate<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.970> piston

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
to how easy it is to operate the piston

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.960 
to how easy it is to operate the piston
it<00:01:41.780> can<00:01:41.960> still<00:01:42.229> be<00:01:42.380> done<00:01:42.620> with<00:01:43.070> two<00:01:43.310> fingers<00:01:43.760> I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
it can still be done with two fingers I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.180 
it can still be done with two fingers I
mean<00:01:44.240> look<00:01:44.600> how<00:01:44.630> little<00:01:45.200> grip<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.620> have<00:01:45.830> on<00:01:46.040> it

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
mean look how little grip I have on it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.580 
mean look how little grip I have on it
and<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.880> operating<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> piston<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.320> fine

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
and it's operating the piston just fine

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.000 
and it's operating the piston just fine
now<00:01:49.580> if<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:49.880> pull<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.990> piston<00:01:51.170> all<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.860> way

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
now if we pull the piston all the way

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.730 
now if we pull the piston all the way
out<00:01:52.159> we'll<00:01:52.700> get<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.850> good<00:01:53.090> look<00:01:53.330> at<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.229> metal

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
out we'll get a good look at the metal

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.500 
out we'll get a good look at the metal

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
that you could fit a wrench like say at

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.690 
that you could fit a wrench like say at
Wisby<00:02:02.930> wrench<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.560> then<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.250> could<00:02:04.369> pull<00:02:04.549> the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
Wisby wrench and then you could pull the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
Wisby wrench and then you could pull the
piston<00:02:04.880> out<00:02:05.180> but<00:02:05.689> if<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.869> ever<00:02:05.960> needed<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.409> do

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
piston out but if you ever needed to do

piston out but if you ever needed to do
this<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.920> would<00:02:07.130> contact<00:02:07.369> pilot<00:02:08.060> first<00:02:08.209> just<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it as you can see it posts pretty far

it as you can see it posts pretty far
down<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.710> barrel<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.880> measures<00:02:54.110> 151

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
down the barrel and it measures 151

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.530 
down the barrel and it measures 151
millimeters<00:02:55.650> long<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.490> total<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.910> 20<00:02:57.270> grams

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.570 
millimeters long and a total of 20 grams
now<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.990> is<00:02:58.110> much<00:02:58.470> more<00:02:58.740> comfortable<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.340> me

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
now this is much more comfortable for me

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.890 
now this is much more comfortable for me
and<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.850> always<00:03:00.270> write<00:03:00.450> with<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.810> this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
and I always write with it in this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.840 
and I always write with it in this
position<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:02.040> give<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> little<00:03:02.670> better

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850

idea<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:04.050> big<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.560> or<00:03:04.830> small<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
idea of just how big it is or small it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.370 
idea of just how big it is or small it
is<00:03:05.520> let's<00:03:06.150> compare<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.690> few<00:03:06.900> other<00:03:07.050> pens

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
is let's compare it to a few other pens

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.760 
is let's compare it to a few other pens
many<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.040> should<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.220> familiar<00:03:08.430> with

many of you should be familiar with
first<00:03:10.770> let's<00:03:11.130> look<00:03:11.250> at<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.520> Pelican<00:03:11.730> M<00:03:12.090> 200

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
first let's look at the Pelican M 200

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.960 
first let's look at the Pelican M 200
now<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:14.160> bit<00:03:14.310> shorter<00:03:14.820> than

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
now it's just a little bit shorter than

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.500 
now it's just a little bit shorter than
the<00:03:15.030> 90<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.500> other<00:03:16.680> pen<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.550> lambing<00:03:17.910> mm

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the 90 to the other pen the lambing mm

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.560 
the 90 to the other pen the lambing mm
is<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.440> little<00:03:19.950> bit<00:03:20.100> bigger<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.269> really

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
is just a little bit bigger but really

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.050 
is just a little bit bigger but really
the<00:03:22.050> big<00:03:22.260> difference<00:03:22.290> or<00:03:22.950> similarities<00:03:23.910> I

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the big difference or similarities I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.360 
the big difference or similarities I
should<00:03:24.239> say<00:03:24.450> comes<00:03:25.080> when<00:03:25.320> we<00:03:25.470> post<00:03:25.800> each<00:03:26.130> of

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
should say comes when we post each of

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.400 
should say comes when we post each of
the<00:03:26.459> pins<00:03:26.670> now<00:03:27.390> you'll<00:03:27.750> see<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.200> there's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the pins now you'll see that there's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.410 
the pins now you'll see that there's
really<00:03:28.739> not<00:03:29.010> much<00:03:29.250> difference<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.940> either<00:03:30.180> of

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
really not much difference in either of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.840 
really not much difference in either of
them<00:03:31.070> here's<00:03:32.070> where<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> real<00:03:32.610> fun<00:03:32.820> begins

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
them here's where the real fun begins

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.449 
them here's where the real fun begins
I'm<00:03:33.780> going<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.080> ink<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.380> 92<00:03:34.800> up<00:03:34.980> with<00:03:35.280> some

the pilot custom heritage 92 does have a

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.720 
the pilot custom heritage 92 does have a
little<00:04:48.260> bit<00:04:48.380> of<00:04:48.410> give<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:49.010> but<00:04:49.610> it's

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
little bit of give to it but it's

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.060 
little bit of give to it but it's
nowhere<00:04:50.090> near<00:04:50.270> flexible<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.260> would<00:04:51.590> more

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
nowhere near flexible I would more

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.210 
nowhere near flexible I would more
describe<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.610> as<00:04:52.760> just<00:04:53.390> soft<00:04:53.860> but<00:04:54.860> if<00:04:55.070> you

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
describe it as just soft but if you

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.700 
describe it as just soft but if you
really<00:04:55.730> wanted<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.600> push<00:04:56.810> into<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.440> mean<00:04:57.590> you

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
really wanted to push into it I mean you

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.970 
really wanted to push into it I mean you
can<00:04:58.010> get<00:04:58.280> some<00:04:58.610> line<00:04:58.940> variation<00:04:59.390> I<00:04:59.870> would<00:05:00.800> say

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
can get some line variation I would say

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.070 
can get some line variation I would say
it's<00:05:01.250> just<00:05:01.370> enough<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.240> add<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.570> little<00:05:02.810> bit<00:05:02.900> of

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
it's just enough to add a little bit of

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.930 
it's just enough to add a little bit of
character<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.560> your<00:05:03.770> writing<00:05:04.100> and<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:04.730> got<00:05:04.850> to

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
character to your writing and you got to

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.450 
character to your writing and you got to
be<00:05:05.030> really<00:05:05.570> heavy-handed<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.830> get<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.190> flex

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
be really heavy-handed to get that flex

be really heavy-handed to get that flex
out<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.910> here<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.660> can<00:05:08.690> see<00:05:09.140> about<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:10.460> max

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
out of it here you can see about the max

out of it here you can see about the max
you're<00:05:11.150> going<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.480> get<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:13.400> would<00:05:13.520> not<00:05:13.700> be

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
you're going to get and it would not be

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.430
