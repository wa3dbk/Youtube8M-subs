water on Neil

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:34.630 
water on Neil
Dremel<00:04:25.120> like<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.890> should<00:04:31.220> go<00:04:31.460> down<00:04:31.510> ah

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:42.130 

and<00:04:35.120> there<00:04:35.480> we<00:04:35.720> have<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.710> that<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:41.140> origin

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
and there we have so that is origin

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.330 
and there we have so that is origin
Dragonoid<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:44.660> actually<00:04:45.290> if<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.650> take<00:04:45.890> it<00:04:46.100> it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
Dragonoid and actually if I take it it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.060 
Dragonoid and actually if I take it it
won't<00:04:46.550> fall<00:04:47.950> it's<00:04:48.950> pretty<00:04:49.310> solid

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
won't fall it's pretty solid

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.990 
won't fall it's pretty solid
um<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.580> can<00:04:52.880> be<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:53.090> little<00:04:53.270> bit<00:04:54.280> dangerous<00:04:55.280> for

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
um it can be a little bit dangerous for

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.590 
um it can be a little bit dangerous for
your<00:04:56.420> scrapper<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.230> put<00:04:57.410> down<00:04:57.680> load<00:04:57.860> heads

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
your scrapper to put down load heads

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.150 
your scrapper to put down load heads
because<00:04:59.600> it

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
because it

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.960 
because it
it<00:05:01.790> caught<00:05:02.450> like<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.320> claw<00:05:03.770> like<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.850> it

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
it caught like the claw like this and it

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.140 
it caught like the claw like this and it
could<00:05:05.180> be<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.780> little<00:05:06.170> open<00:05:06.700> don't<00:05:07.700> care<00:05:07.940> so

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
could be a little open don't care so

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.570 
could be a little open don't care so
much<00:05:08.420> or<00:05:08.810> just<00:05:09.680> take<00:05:10.370> uh<00:05:10.730> uh<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:16.070> don't<00:05:16.250> remember

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
much or just take uh uh I don't remember

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.720 
much or just take uh uh I don't remember
I<00:05:17.000> was<00:05:18.250> starting<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.280> take<00:05:20.210> out<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.450> little<00:05:20.720> bit

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
I was starting to take out a little bit

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
let's give her physics to do I hope I'm

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.190 
let's give her physics to do I hope I'm
not<00:05:52.190> too<00:05:53.180> much<00:05:53.510> boring<00:05:54.190> goodbye
