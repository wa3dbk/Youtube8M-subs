00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
got a strong spring so it actually

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.280

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
will get all the way through the meat

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
will get all the way through the meat
now<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> state<00:02:10.500> covered<00:02:10.830> with

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
now they have the state covered with

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.699 
now they have the state covered with
your<00:02:11.130> marinade<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:13.170> want<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> state<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
your marinade you want the state to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.280 
your marinade you want the state to
reach<00:02:13.980> room<00:02:14.220> temperature<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.720> want<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.019> sit

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
reach room temperature you want to sit

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.949 
reach room temperature you want to sit
out<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.910> let<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:17.940> not<00:02:18.269> sit<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.840> than

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
out and let it not sit for more than

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.890 
out and let it not sit for more than
half<00:02:19.019> an<00:02:19.350> hour<00:02:20.120> basically<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> cold<00:02:21.420> steak<00:02:21.750> on

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
half an hour basically a cold steak on

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.210 
half an hour basically a cold steak on
the<00:02:21.989> grill<00:02:22.050> comes<00:02:22.410> out<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> little<00:02:22.620> bit<00:02:22.860> tougher

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the grill comes out a little bit tougher

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.610 
the grill comes out a little bit tougher
so<00:02:24.030> by<00:02:24.480> letting<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.080> cheap<00:02:25.440> room

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
so by letting it a cheap room

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
so by letting it a cheap room
temperature<00:02:26.540> you're<00:02:27.540> better<00:02:27.690> off<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.380> do

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
temperature you're better off you can do

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.650 
temperature you're better off you can do
that<00:02:28.620> before<00:02:28.829> this<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:30.000> stage<00:02:30.209> ready<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> go

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
that before this this stage ready to go

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.940 
that before this this stage ready to go
in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.810> grill<00:02:31.019> because<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.380> believe<00:02:31.620> them<00:02:31.739> set

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
in the grill because I believe them set
