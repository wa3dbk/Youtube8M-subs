00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.030
 There are several graffiti culture 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.429
 directions this how primitive 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 bombing drawings in which the essence 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.460
 is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.400
 to do quickly and together where could 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.060
 would see a large number of people this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.050
 the facades of the roof buildings is clear the thing is that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 subways and trains they are made like me 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.270
 spoke quickly there for maybe 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.030
 5 10 minutes but with rare exception 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.140
 longer present as a rule 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.450
 small amount of flowers and mostly 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 these are fonts i.e. artists write their own 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.860
 pseudonyms 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.170
 different interpretations and different 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 style 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.329
 another direction is already more 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 professional 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.189
 this is a writer where a job can get away from 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.640
 a few hours to a few days and then 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.470
 and weeks of colossal volumes that is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.400
 now done and 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.650
 building 5 10 floors that example 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 peter kazan another direction is 3d 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.710
 graphics i.e. volumetric shift and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.010
 literally five years ago you can say 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.830
 swept such a direction as 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.650
 photorealism is carried over drawings and 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.940
 photos 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.500
 either just even from nature 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.410
 a lot has become a lady to draw their 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.390
 familiar friends of famous characters 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.990
 graphics as well as in the classic 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.979
 academic drawings need knowledge 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.290
 building and light and shade but that is if you 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:03.150
 of course you are going to draw characters 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.150
 or 3d to draw fonts 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.950
 they can of course not necessarily 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.580
 just watch what they are doing 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.120
 other people and try to create something 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.730
 its 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.130
 I think it will be easier to demonstrate something 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.730
 how to start drawing and step by step it 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.730
 complete 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.730
 I'll tell you a little more color and attributes 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.800
 her 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.050
 nozzles are very important 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.330
 which is used with them is cops 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.820
 There are intermediate for different 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.130
 items in general different nozzles in 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.760
 mainly used two types of nozzles 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.709
 well, some resort and in more 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.570
 the number of all nozzles is a simple line 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.590
 line thickness which can be adjusted 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.820
 with her 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.209
 wider fillings are used 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.980
 to work out the details more subtle 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.370
 nozzles when you start drawing on 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.900
 the wall 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.459
 better throws what will be 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.459
 any neutral color
