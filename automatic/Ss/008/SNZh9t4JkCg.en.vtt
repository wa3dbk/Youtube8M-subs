actually gave us a nice amount of
recline<00:03:34.840> here<00:03:35.169> so<00:03:35.349> it's<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.620> really<00:03:35.919> really

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
recline here so it's a really really

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.089 
recline here so it's a really really
comfortable<00:03:37.150> place<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.419> be<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.919> we've

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
comfortable place to be that it is we've

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.280 
comfortable place to be that it is we've
planned<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.790> in<00:03:39.940> also<00:03:40.299> because<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
planned that in also because of the the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.199 
planned that in also because of the the
optimum<00:03:41.859> is<00:03:41.980> around<00:03:42.190> 12<00:03:42.519> degrees<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.120> that's

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
optimum is around 12 degrees and that's

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.970 
optimum is around 12 degrees and that's
why<00:03:43.389> we<00:03:43.540> made<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.019> background<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:44.769> notice

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
why we made the background I so notice

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.129 
why we made the background I so notice
we<00:03:45.129> had<00:03:45.220> storage<00:03:45.639> underneath<00:03:45.970> as<00:03:46.269> well<00:03:46.299> plus<00:03:46.989> a

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
we had storage underneath as well plus a

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.990 
we had storage underneath as well plus a
cooler<00:03:47.349> on<00:03:47.590> my<00:03:47.769> side<00:03:48.010> okay<00:03:48.579> cool

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
