all<00:00:31.249> right<00:00:31.460> you'll<00:00:31.669> notice<00:00:31.939> that<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
all right you'll notice that the

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.439 
all right you'll notice that the
Motorola<00:00:33.230> MC<00:00:33.500> 91<00:00:33.980> 90<00:00:34.309> does<00:00:34.550> come<00:00:34.850> in<00:00:35.059> a<00:00:35.180> base

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
Motorola MC 91 90 does come in a base

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.780 
Motorola MC 91 90 does come in a base
unit<00:00:35.719> it's<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.110> charging<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:36.620> essentially<00:00:37.190> in

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
unit it's a charging it essentially in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.069 
unit it's a charging it essentially in
order<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.149> pull<00:00:38.300> that<00:00:38.420> out<00:00:38.600> all<00:00:38.809> you<00:00:38.899> need<00:00:38.989> to

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
order to pull that out all you need to

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.569 
order to pull that out all you need to
do<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.230> hold<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.469> base<00:00:39.620> down<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.129> lift<00:00:40.430> up

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
do is hold the base down and lift up

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.130 
do is hold the base down and lift up
slightly<00:00:40.699> pretty<00:00:41.449> simple

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
slightly pretty simple

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.750 
slightly pretty simple
it<00:00:42.410> only<00:00:42.589> goes<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.100> one<00:00:43.129> way<00:00:43.399> you'll<00:00:43.610> notice

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
it only goes in one way you'll notice

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.939 
it only goes in one way you'll notice
those<00:00:44.030> connections<00:00:44.690> right<00:00:44.870> here<00:00:45.140> that

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
those connections right here that

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.439 
those connections right here that
correspond<00:00:46.460> with<00:00:46.610> these<00:00:46.760> connections<00:00:47.269> here

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
correspond with these connections here

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.660 
correspond with these connections here
they<00:00:48.199> simply<00:00:48.589> drop<00:00:48.829> right<00:00:48.979> in<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.190> base<00:00:49.370> and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
they simply drop right in the base and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.119 
they simply drop right in the base and
push<00:00:50.479> it<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.720> you'll<00:00:50.899> see<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> light<00:00:51.470> light<00:00:51.920> up

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
push it in you'll see the light light up

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.130 
push it in you'll see the light light up
on<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.550> hand<00:00:52.909> unit<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.750> way<00:00:53.899> you<00:00:53.960> know

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
on the hand unit that way you know

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.110 
on the hand unit that way you know
you've<00:00:54.290> made<00:00:54.379> a<00:00:54.440> secure<00:00:54.829> connection<00:00:55.070> let<00:00:56.030> me

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
you've made a secure connection let me

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.479 
you've made a secure connection let me
show<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.420> back<00:00:56.629> of<00:00:56.839> this<00:00:57.190> there<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.339> a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
show you the back of this there is a

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.509 
show you the back of this there is a
spot<00:00:58.790> for<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.120> USB<00:00:59.870> plug<00:01:00.079> should<00:01:00.469> we<00:01:01.190> need<00:01:01.370> you

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
spot for a USB plug should we need you

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.759

to plug that in what is setting in your

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.590 
to plug that in what is setting in your
location<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.400> does<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:04.939> not<00:01:05.089> plugged<00:01:05.360> in

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
location it does it is not plugged in

there's one here and one there simply
press<00:01:26.970> those<00:01:27.090> buttons<00:01:27.149> in<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> battery<00:01:29.009> will

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
press those buttons in the battery will

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.919 
press those buttons in the battery will
pop<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> slight<00:01:30.000> ways<00:01:30.210> you'll<00:01:30.659> notice

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
pop out of slight ways you'll notice

there's a green tab right there push it
in<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.929> battery<00:01:34.200> comes<00:01:34.409> out<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.649> rest<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
in and the battery comes out the rest of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.830 
in and the battery comes out the rest of
the<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.069> to<00:01:35.850> put<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> battery<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.539> all<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the way to put the battery in all you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.410 
the way to put the battery in all you
need<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> slide<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.829> battery<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.420> until

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
need to do is slide the battery in until

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.969 
need to do is slide the battery in until
it<00:01:39.509> clicks<00:01:39.539> hard<00:01:40.130> like<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:43.560> puts<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it clicks hard like that that puts the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.529 
it clicks hard like that that puts the
bed<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> way<00:01:44.789> now<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> power<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
bed in all the way now to power the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.969 
bed in all the way now to power the
device<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.049> there's<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> power<00:01:46.649> button<00:01:46.950> right

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
device on there's a power button right

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.339 
device on there's a power button right
here<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.490> red<00:01:47.640> button<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.209> push<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
here it's a red button you push that

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:51.679 
here it's a red button you push that
once<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.299> bring<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.569> device

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
once and it's going to bring the device

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.080 
once and it's going to bring the device
up<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.959> now<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.020> Pala<00:01:55.349> device<00:01:55.709> off

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
up like that now the Pala device off

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.130 
up like that now the Pala device off
should<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.209> need<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
should we need you to do that the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.570 
should we need you to do that the
