hitmontop so they're probably gonna

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.530 
hitmontop so they're probably gonna
finish<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.290> off<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.709> then<00:02:29.970> sneezes<00:02:30.970> ice<00:02:31.240> punch

and they use it on bronzong it doesn't

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.480 
and they use it on bronzong it doesn't
really<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.360> much<00:02:34.390> because<00:02:35.040> bronzong<00:02:36.040> resist

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
really do much because bronzong resist

Sneasel uses time which was smart but
not<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:04.959> case<00:03:05.019> because<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.890> wasn't<00:03:06.310> even

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
not in this case because I wasn't even

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.260 
not in this case because I wasn't even
doing

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
doing

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.030 
doing
and<00:03:09.780> yeah<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.050> get<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> critical<00:03:11.650> here<00:03:11.860> I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and yeah so I get a critical here I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.370 
and yeah so I get a critical here I
don't<00:03:12.940> even<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.270> what<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.510> regice<00:03:14.200> is

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380

would<00:03:22.570> really<00:03:22.840> do<00:03:22.990> anything<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.740> did<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.430> only

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
would really do anything so did it only

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.290
