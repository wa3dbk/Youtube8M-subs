00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.110
 pursuing our site is the 2015 one 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.180
 is at the sunny top of trembling 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.420
 north face to introduce you to the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.220
 phisheur motivates 86 fischer skis are 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.380
 allowed of course the best in the world 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.169
 whether it's world cup - which 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.730
 in Hebrew skiing and freshness it takes 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.710
 also to say it is one of the most important 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.960
 automotive parts manufacturers 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.390
 carbon of the planet so a lot of 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.430
 Technology at Fisher's hot you 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.050
 will certainly have seen 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.780
 Olympic Games that it is the majority of 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.730
 ski jumpers he has his nose in front of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.040
 hands behind who have fischer skis 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.500
 so a lot of technologies 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.670
 especially in cross-country skiing and I 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.960
 talk about ski jumping and skiing 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.230
 background why because in this new 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 engine 86 we will end up with a ski 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.000
 which is 25% more and lighter than if he had 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.010
 been built in a classic way 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.869
 it's just that we made 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.400
 inside a nucleus that is inspired by 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.510
 cross-country skiing technology called 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.010
 the short hairtech stems explains the 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.550
 hairtech body knows that inside the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.170
 core 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.310
 a bit like skiing skis from 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.100
 background we engraved graffiti for 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.510
 lighten the core which more is two 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.420
 titanium plate to make it very 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.060
 performant because the fitter 86 and 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.120
 with the mount to 95 of both styles and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.380
 more efficient of the range the plate 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.210
 of titanium that end up on the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.250
 above has been like in others 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 marks were amputated from certain 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.170
 sections to allow both the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.510
 torsional stiffness and also a lot of 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.540
 lightness and be able to get when 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.180
 same reflex that will be very friendly 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 to not necessarily be registered to 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.280
 very important to be able to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.740
 loot 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 the station raised from 20 to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.250
 really of a language and easily the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.850
 budgets it goes from the shelves so that's 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.850
 still nice 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.420
 2 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.129
 and I take four months to do a slalom 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.440
 had a little bit for his architecture 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.910
 otherwise what else to say that we also have 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.099
 at fisher motive a combo under the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.019
 spatula but also while from the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.230
 front ski to facilitate its 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.610
 initiation at 86 of width one gets 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.950
 still find with a ski enough 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.870
 wide but given that one ski very 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.640
 we will feel we have not 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.160
 a 86 under the foot we have the impression 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.780
 we will have a ski - so very 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.239
 agile and very fast of a map to 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.360
 the other what they can ski 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:51.819
 performing what will be in a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.680
 175 cm in size which go to the radius of 17 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.030
 meters of radius so we play there in 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 the east of the skis a ski that does everything 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.620
 would say in English ounce quiver 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.819
 windsurfing a hairdresser that's all 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 our material several boards 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.549
 several sails a ski cover this is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.349
 mine there is installed a giant rtm 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.430
 billion nothias another there is 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.200
 a lot but I have a position 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.420
 privileged in the industry that me 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.030
 lets have that if I had one this 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.269
 who in your hairdresser in your bag to 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.630
 skis you may be able to think of 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.829
 bend motivates 86 if you want more 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.150
 wide because you think you 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.700
 go deeper into the snow 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.130
 you're going to go to the 95 he's getting 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.109
 also in 74 in 76 and in 80 so a 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.500
 nice range in 2015 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.760
 the fact ch rose to 80.6 with its 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.220
 famous technology 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.220
 hairtech a lighten core
