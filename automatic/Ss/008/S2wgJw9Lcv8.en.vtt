because the one that was in there at the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.010 
because the one that was in there at the
previous<00:02:23.880> owner<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.420> together<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.900> he

ceramic<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.959> Kevlar<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:34.290> mean<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> needs<00:02:35.130> new

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
ceramic and Kevlar I mean it needs new

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
ceramic and Kevlar I mean it needs new
cab<00:02:35.580> bushings<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.450> new<00:02:36.569> cab<00:02:36.780> mounts<00:02:37.230> and

cab bushings and new cab mounts and
everything<00:02:37.739> but<00:02:37.920> uh<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.239> most<00:02:39.420> part

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
everything but uh for the most part

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.009 
everything but uh for the most part
she's<00:02:39.900> still<00:02:40.110> pretty<00:02:41.069> solid<00:02:41.600> but<00:02:42.600> yeah<00:02:42.780> as<00:02:42.900> you

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
she's still pretty solid but yeah as you

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.140 
she's still pretty solid but yeah as you
can<00:02:43.050> see<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.380> got<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> lot<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.160> lot<00:02:44.519> more<00:02:44.580> clearance

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
can see I got a lot a lot more clearance

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.699 
can see I got a lot a lot more clearance
now<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.569> put<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> lift<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.230> than<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> did

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
now that I put the lift on than I did

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.110 
now that I put the lift on than I did
when<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.890> had<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.220> two<00:02:47.370> inch<00:02:48.110> lift<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.350> so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
when I had the two inch lift on it so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.400 
when I had the two inch lift on it so
yeah<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.209> definitely<00:02:51.569> looks<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.840> lot<00:02:52.019> better<00:02:52.260> in

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
yeah it definitely looks a lot better in

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.309 
yeah it definitely looks a lot better in
my<00:02:52.500> opinion<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.850> bed's<00:02:57.090> rotted<00:02:57.630> real<00:02:57.810> bad<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
my opinion the bed's rotted real bad the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.130 
my opinion the bed's rotted real bad the
floors<00:02:58.650> rotted<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.549> wheel<00:03:00.330> wells<00:03:00.600> are<00:03:00.780> rotted

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
floors rotted the wheel wells are rotted

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.650 
floors rotted the wheel wells are rotted
but<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> got<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> really<00:03:02.489> really<00:03:02.940> nice<00:03:03.209> bed<00:03:03.510> at

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
but I got a really really nice bed at

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.990 
but I got a really really nice bed at
home<00:03:03.870> for<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.950> my<00:03:05.100> dad's<00:03:05.310> gonna<00:03:05.610> put<00:03:05.850> in

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
primer and paint for me it looks like

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.070 
primer and paint for me it looks like
it's<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:08.940> low<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.360> driver<00:03:09.630> side<00:03:09.720> because

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
it's it's low on the driver side because

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.140 
it's it's low on the driver side because
it's<00:03:10.260> sitting<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> little<00:03:11.700> hump<00:03:11.940> right

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's sitting on a on a little hump right
now<00:03:12.269> but<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.170> pretty<00:03:13.920> level<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
now but it's it's like pretty level a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.310 
now but it's it's like pretty level a
little<00:03:14.579> bit<00:03:14.700> higher<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.090> foot<00:03:15.600> I'd

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
little bit higher in the back foot I'd

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.960 
little bit higher in the back foot I'd
rather<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.739> sit<00:03:16.920> higher<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> back<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
rather it sit higher in the back and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.650 
rather it sit higher in the back and
high<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> front<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:20.390> mean<00:03:21.390> she<00:03:21.420> needs

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
high in the front so I mean she needs

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.949 
high in the front so I mean she needs
rocker<00:03:21.989> panels<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.540> some<00:03:24.540> things<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:24.900> that

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.660 
because that block was actually wiggling
around<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.290> there's<00:04:26.620> tapered<00:04:27.010> lug<00:04:27.190> nuts<00:04:27.430> hold

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
around and there's tapered lug nuts hold

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.250 
around and there's tapered lug nuts hold
it<00:04:27.820> down<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.270> one<00:04:28.450> place<00:04:28.720> stop<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.170> from

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
it down that one place stop it from

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.440 
it down that one place stop it from
lurking<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:30.580> course<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:30.940> got<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.090> steering

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
lurking of course I got a steering

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.060 
lurking of course I got a steering
stabilizer<00:04:32.850> all<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:34.030> good<00:04:34.210> stuff

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
stabilizer all that good stuff

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.920 
stabilizer all that good stuff
so<00:04:36.070> yeah<00:04:36.340> I've<00:04:36.640> just<00:04:36.670> just<00:04:37.480> been<00:04:37.660> trying<00:04:37.870> to

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
so yeah I've just just been trying to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.930 
so yeah I've just just been trying to
take<00:04:38.020> pretty<00:04:38.200> good<00:04:38.290> care<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.790> know<00:04:39.910> I

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
take pretty good care of it you know I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.700 
take pretty good care of it you know I
mean<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.240> doesn't<00:04:40.510> owe<00:04:40.690> me<00:04:40.720> anything<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.470> try

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
mean it doesn't owe me anything so I try

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.510 
mean it doesn't owe me anything so I try
to<00:04:41.770> take<00:04:41.920> care<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.220> it

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
to take care of it

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.790 
to take care of it
not<00:04:42.790> on<00:04:42.910> me<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.330> don't<00:04:43.870> want<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.080> do<00:04:44.170> any<00:04:44.320> more

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
not on me I don't want to do any more

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400 
not on me I don't want to do any more
major<00:04:44.980> work<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.610> for<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.850> while<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.420> the<00:04:47.170> only

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
major work to it for a while so the only

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.610 
major work to it for a while so the only
thing<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.650> got<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.830> figure<00:04:48.160> out<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.550> why<00:04:49.620> my

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
thing I got to figure out is why my

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.940 
thing I got to figure out is why my
front<00:04:51.010> angle<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.700> bad<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:53.110> drive<00:04:53.680> shaft

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
front angle is so bad the drive shaft

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.710 
front angle is so bad the drive shaft
actually<00:04:54.220> binds<00:04:55.890> quite<00:04:56.890> a<00:04:56.920> bit

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
actually binds quite a bit

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.420 
actually binds quite a bit
and<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.110> got<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.380> figure<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.740> out<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.160> I<00:05:00.190> can

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
and so I got to figure that out so I can

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.450 
and so I got to figure that out so I can
use<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.670> full<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:01.000> drive<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.980> might<00:05:03.340> have

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
use the full of drive I might have

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.300 
use the full of drive I might have
broken<00:05:03.670> a<00:05:04.260> line<00:05:05.260> at<00:05:05.410> pin<00:05:05.620> on<00:05:05.740> my<00:05:05.860> leaf<00:05:06.040> spring

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
broken a line at pin on my leaf spring

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.120 
broken a line at pin on my leaf spring
because<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.270> looks<00:05:07.600> like<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.260> right

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
because it looks like that this right

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.300 
because it looks like that this right
tire<00:05:09.430> sits<00:05:10.000> farther<00:05:10.510> back<00:05:10.840> than<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:12.040> driver

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
tire sits farther back than the driver

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.710 
tire sits farther back than the driver
side<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:12.880> I'll<00:05:13.000> have<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.210> check<00:05:13.420> into<00:05:13.600> that

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
side so I'll have to check into that

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.140 
side so I'll have to check into that
better<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:15.220> know<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.430> oil<00:05:15.460> leaks<00:05:15.940> are<00:05:16.060> at<00:05:16.120> a

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
better you know the oil leaks are at a

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.850 
better you know the oil leaks are at a
minimum<00:05:16.390> now<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.020> pretty<00:05:17.200> much<00:05:17.260> resealed

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
minimum now that I pretty much resealed

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.490 
minimum now that I pretty much resealed
everything<00:05:18.720> we<00:05:19.720> built<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.050> front<00:05:20.260> drive<00:05:20.470> shaft

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
everything we built a front drive shaft

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.710 
everything we built a front drive shaft
new<00:05:21.460> leaf<00:05:21.670> spring<00:05:21.940> bushings<00:05:23.880> on<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.270> black<00:05:25.480> on

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
new leaf spring bushings on the black on

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.230 
new leaf spring bushings on the black on
the<00:05:25.840> back<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:26.050> just<00:05:26.260> got<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:27.340> beefed-up<00:05:27.820> leaf

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
the back I just got a beefed-up leaf

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.230 
the back I just got a beefed-up leaf
springs<00:05:29.310> they<00:05:30.310> got<00:05:30.460> like<00:05:30.610> eight<00:05:30.790> Leafs<00:05:31.030> in

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
springs they got like eight Leafs in
