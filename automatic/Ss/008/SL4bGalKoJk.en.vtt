Hi, my name is Aleksandra and today we are preparing green beans.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.460
This is one of my favourite meals because I grew up on village where you have fresh beans through all the year

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.980
and my mum always knew how to make them to be delicious.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.220
Take 1,5 kg of fresh green beans.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:31.660
You can use green or yellow beens. What is important is that they are soft.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.540
Cut off the endings and half the green beans.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.880
Heat 50 ml of oil and add 300 gr of chopped or grated carrots.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.720
Cook and stir for 4 minutes until soft.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.640
Add 200 gr of chopped onions, cover and cook for 5 minutes.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.140
Add green beans into the pot.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.440
Add only around 750 gr at the start. And don't forget to wash the before cooking.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
Stir gently and add the rest of the green beans in the pot.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.060
Cover and let it cook for 5 minutes.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.960
Add 15 gr of Vegeta and 10 gr of salt and mix all gently.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:55.440
It will be a bit hard to mix them now because they are long and still hard but they will soften in few minutes.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.860
Cover and cook for 10 min.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.240
Now it will be much easier to stir them.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
Add 250 ml of hot water and cook for 20 minutes.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.440
Now we will do the final step.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.760
Prepare 200 gr of cream and one egg.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.980
Break the egg and mix it with cream.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.520
Add 3 gr of salt depending how salty is the cream.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.960
The best option for the cream would be if you can buy it directly from farmers.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.940
Place the green beans in the baking tray and add the cream on the top.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.380
Heat the oven on 200 Â°C and bake the green beans for 10 minutes.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.560
