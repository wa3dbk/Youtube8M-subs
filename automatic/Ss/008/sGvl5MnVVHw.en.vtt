00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.259 

so<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> tg2<00:03:37.260> has<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> input<00:03:38.189> gain<00:03:38.609> control<00:03:39.060> here

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
so the tg2 has a input gain control here

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.270 
so the tg2 has a input gain control here
that's<00:03:39.450> stepped<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.799> kind<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.099> in

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
that's stepped so you can kind of in

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.179 
that's stepped so you can kind of in
large<00:03:41.819> intervals<00:03:42.269> here<00:03:42.560> set<00:03:43.560> how<00:03:43.739> much<00:03:43.859> gain

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
large intervals here set how much gain

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.789 
large intervals here set how much gain
you<00:03:44.370> want<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.849> then<00:03:45.299> there's<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.510> fine<00:03:45.840> tuning

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
you want and then there's a fine tuning

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.679 
you want and then there's a fine tuning
control<00:03:47.250> here<00:03:47.519> that's<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.760> variable<00:03:48.090> pot<00:03:48.480> that

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
control here that's a variable pot that

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.210 
control here that's a variable pot that
allows<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.140> kind<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.349> get<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.650> between<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
allows you to kind of get in between the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.009 
allows you to kind of get in between the
intervals<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:50.760> that's<00:03:50.939> nice<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.450> then

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
intervals so that's nice and then

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.080 
intervals so that's nice and then
there's<00:03:52.170> an<00:03:52.260> overall<00:03:52.680> level<00:03:53.430> control<00:03:53.849> here

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
there's an overall level control here

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.629 
there's an overall level control here
that<00:03:54.299> kind<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.900> acts<00:03:55.109> like<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.319> master<00:03:56.250> fader<00:03:56.549> on

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
that kind of acts like a master fader on

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.449 
that kind of acts like a master fader on
a<00:03:56.760> console<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.420> allows<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:58.340> set<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
a console that allows you to set the

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.099 
a console that allows you to set the
overall<00:03:59.730> level<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.359> into<00:04:00.569> your<00:04:00.689> interface

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
overall level going into your interface

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.979 
overall level going into your interface
so<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.709> can<00:04:01.920> drive<00:04:02.250> up<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:03.180> front<00:04:03.689> end<00:04:03.870> of

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
so you can drive up the the front end of

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:04.970 
so you can drive up the the front end of
the<00:04:04.049> might<00:04:04.170> Priya<00:04:04.409> if<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.530> want<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.739> get<00:04:04.829> more

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
the might Priya if you want to get more

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.379 
the might Priya if you want to get more
coloration<00:04:05.609> if<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.790> want<00:04:05.939> to<00:04:06.000> kind<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.180> drive

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
coloration if you want to kind of drive

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.869 
coloration if you want to kind of drive
it<00:04:06.420> harder<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.310> let's<00:04:08.310> see<00:04:08.430> what<00:04:08.579> else<00:04:08.700> we've

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
it harder and let's see what else we've

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.879 
it harder and let's see what else we've
got<00:04:08.939> an<00:04:09.239> impedance<00:04:09.629> selector<00:04:10.319> switch<00:04:10.620> here<00:04:10.859> so

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
got an impedance selector switch here so

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.399 
got an impedance selector switch here so
you<00:04:11.099> can<00:04:11.280> kind<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.389> set<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.959> preamp<00:04:13.319> for

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
you can kind of set the preamp for

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.589 
you can kind of set the preamp for
microphones<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.519> lower<00:04:14.700> or<00:04:14.970> higher<00:04:15.000> impedance

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
microphones of lower or higher impedance

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.460 
microphones of lower or higher impedance
very<00:04:16.019> easily<00:04:16.699> there's<00:04:17.699> a<00:04:17.789> line<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.780> mic<00:04:19.079> level

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
very easily there's a line and mic level

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.839 
very easily there's a line and mic level
switch<00:04:19.739> here<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.039> case<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.280> want<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.519> run<00:04:20.639> line

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
switch here in case you want to run line

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.810 
switch here in case you want to run line
level<00:04:21.060> signals<00:04:21.539> into<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> unit<00:04:22.639> there's<00:04:23.639> also

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
level signals into the unit there's also

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.510 
level signals into the unit there's also
a<00:04:23.970> phantom<00:04:24.870> power<00:04:25.080> switch<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.830> then<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.280> phase

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
a phantom power switch and then a phase

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.219 
a phantom power switch and then a phase
reversal<00:04:26.910> switch<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.360> everything<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.930> need

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
reversal switch so everything you need

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.950 
reversal switch so everything you need
in<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.889> quality<00:04:29.729> microphone<00:04:30.270> preamp<00:04:30.690> it's<00:04:30.840> the
