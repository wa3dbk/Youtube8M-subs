this whole thing here I think this is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
all good I just have to take the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.160 
all good I just have to take the
windshield<00:03:22.390> off<00:03:22.830> unbolt<00:03:23.830> this<00:03:24.160> from<00:03:25.120> from<00:03:26.020> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
windshield off unbolt this from from the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.490 
windshield off unbolt this from from the
rest<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.710> unbolt<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.880> from<00:03:28.330> this<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.440> I

rest of this unbolt this from this and I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:37.430 
rest of this unbolt this from this and I
think<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.950> should<00:03:30.940> be<00:03:31.090> good<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:33.030> hope<00:03:34.350> so

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.420 

otherwise<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.770> bike<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:40.620> fairly<00:03:41.620> decent

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
otherwise the bike is in fairly decent

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:59.150 
otherwise the bike is in fairly decent
condition<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.390> was<00:03:43.480> laid<00:03:43.660> down<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:44.080> this<00:03:44.260> side

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.890 

so<00:04:00.690> yeah<00:04:01.690> that's<00:04:02.560> my<00:04:02.620> bike<00:04:03.360> he<00:04:04.360> needs<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.690> lot<00:04:04.840> of

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
so yeah that's my bike he needs a lot of

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.170 
so yeah that's my bike he needs a lot of
work
