00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.620
 so that friends as they are is so that 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.450
 are very well my name is alex and the 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.670
 today I bring you to eren arrives from 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.320
 jinghe who does not want to spend a position 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.390
 of action and one of the embers does not know 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.890
 by perspective let's start 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.680
 add it in the details of the face to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.750
 the face is in position 34 face b 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.059
 in is characterized because the features do not 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.489
 they are extremely straight they are also they are 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.530
 rounded giving it like a sensation 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.340
 more than child remember that the character in 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.320
 the story is not a character that 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.670
 The 20- year-old was probably 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.650
 well, not even the majority has arrived 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.239
 old summer hair extremely 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.850
 simple the truth is how to live the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.470
 head in two and draw a section of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.989
 hair for one side and the other for another 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.690
 side and the facial expression is going to be like that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.500
 as an annoyance of bravery and as 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.660
 my country called 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.840
 colloquially I refine and mind 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.640
 arrechera 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 many details are made of the since 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.149
 I am directly in this type of 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.399
 tutorials I'm going to focus directly 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.679
 in adding them in the most amount of 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.869
 possible workshops from the beginning for 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.479
 the not so that it is not done extremely 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.509
 long and remember that if you try to make 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.789
 you can divide the drawing with figure 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.350
 geometric to make it easier for you 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.790
 and then to add the details with 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.180
 more precision 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 I do not need it to my private home 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.070
 however it is a good technique if 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.350
 I'm going to start adding 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.840
 different stages that if the swords the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.820
 torso and different aspects that it has 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.890
 this uniform as well as the device 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.350
 pc average and the different strings that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.690
 was attached to this I'm going to go 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.580
 polishing the details a little more 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.010
 I will go adding the eyes 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.720
 navigating defining the eyes has ten 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.880
 in mind that it's like a medium way 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.990
 Almendrada and with the face you generate 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.090
 Many cares for the feeling 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.220
 what are you trying to convey a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.410
 misplaced line can make you brave 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.740
 I ended up being a sensation of 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.430
 sadness or depression who knows 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.620
 madness maybe 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.650
 they are not going to do me much anymore 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.719
 detail in this type of sketches remember 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.280
 that the details opposite added us 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:35.209
 always in the inking 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.730
 but adding details of the jacket and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.830
 by wrinkles those wrinkles 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 I'm going to go much deeper to 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.120
 shading time 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 in the workshop of the key feature 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.630
 of the character the straps 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.550
 the jacket and the various accessories 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.730
 jacket designs and percy as the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.290
 coat of arms shoulder pads those things 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.820
 have babies that do not give me that name and 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.110
 if you know it please leave me in the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.110
 comments how are they called 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.540
 the sword and others 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.069
 I know I was finally as inactive 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.510
 but it has been as by problems 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.939
 personal you can raise me lives and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.900
 so often but I promise playing 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.359
 I promise 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.489
 I promise that I will try to upload videos 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.069
 weekly but they happen to be 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.079
 launched but I do not want to give a date of 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.280
 exact output is simply for the 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.330
 week 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.230
 you can continue adding details of 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.030
 device the different cases 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.490
 Etcetera Etcetera Etcetera as it is called 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.170
 the ropes 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.270
 and go up a little more details 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.680
 basically right now we are in what I 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.680
 called the carpentry stage 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.870
 in my opinion this good series that is 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.960
 very, very good, I'm not surprised 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.340
 in the modern era of the anime year I pulled 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.530
 a series that from the beginning has been 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.750
 a chapter as acidic as it was his first 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.190
 chapter in order now let's proceed 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.740
 ink but there is a time 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.330
 always with a 57 pixel brush in 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.860
 reality is not a gap so thick 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.720
 remember that what characterizes the anime 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.580
 is that the lines are extremely thin 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.640
 although I like to use a little and I 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.030
 like the thick lines the lines 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.030
 by dry 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.600
 so I make a little bit of a trap between 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.340
 quotes and decided to add a link is 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.199
 a little thicker though you have 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.509
 what to know in case you want to abuse 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.979
 of this where you have to put them 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.060
 you can put the nails with lines so 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.590
 thick because it's not really going to 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.070
 look rajoy or otherwise rather stained 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.070
 in the face 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.830
 just as it is so perfect is to put lines 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.080
 thick in areas that actually months 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.419
 these thin lines and are the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.569
 English feminists very serious and giving 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.160
 details like the clavicle the braids 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.870
 the straps is already of character brings 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.970
 teapot remember what I told you ago 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.289
 was that I usually try 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.710
 add most of the details in the 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.900
 invented nothing is useful this kill you 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.270
 adding so much detail 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.250
 from the beginning clear if you do it they will 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.870
 have higher results but in the case 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.440
 you want to do something casual like 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.990
 what am I doing I advise you not to 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.520
 you take them so seriously from the start the 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.990
 details and who you dedicate to 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.789
 put them at the guest's time 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.830
 remember that I usually have seven of 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.990
 blue and red and black so that the 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.129
 Contrast helps me see those areas 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.199
 that I inked 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.760
 above all still very much consideration that 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.249
 I'm half blind 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.199
 if I'm going to keep adding details 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:47.930
 basically the guest is what I 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.819
 I call the final woodworking phase is 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.830
 just that in which through 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.120
 correct certain proportions that you 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.939
 seem to have gone wrong or simply 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.740
 you read details that already prepares you with 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.120
 which you are happy to remember that 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.460
 these people have a role I recommend you 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.430
 that you are satisfied with your sketches is 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.370
 more do not try the same day expect a 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.529
 day to be able to ink it so that 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.909
 your vision that the next day have 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.090
 catch is here and you can realize 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.620
 the proportion errors however if 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.200
 they are simply computer you can 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.970
 do it directly contribute 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.530
 in class I love you that you can fly 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.750
 however on paper if you are wrong 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.310
 probably strong you have to repeat it to 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.310
 not to be good hiding 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.760
 and what I'm going to implement to dita is the 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.760
 question of the day 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.060
 what do you think about this series, you think it's a 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.040
 Type of hacked series overrated no 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.160
 you think that it's really a good series 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.540
 that the merit that has been earned 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.820
 lately it is the one that the one who 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.860
 it deserves has finally seen simply 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.020
 finished adding certain details and 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.020
 once finished adding it go to 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.900
 proceed to shade the seeding to do 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.280
 differently however I'm not going 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.510
 to stop to explain as a shadow of 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.460
 making a house is not the purpose of 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.020
 tutorial if you want a tutorial about 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.180
 of seeded please let me in the 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.440
 comment box as well as that 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.710
 the character you want to see 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.950
 continuation in order this has been all 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.700
 for today my name is Arab and see you 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.870
 in another installment remember to like 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.890
 share it subscribe if you have not 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.010

 add favorites etc. and so on 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.470
 etcetera is like that down in the description 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.090
 I leave you the different social networks in 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.100
 what can I be that you already know 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.780
 there is the one who speaks with confidence also 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.230
 in the description of the video I leave you the 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.660
