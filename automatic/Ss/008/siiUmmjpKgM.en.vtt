good test is to be able to put your hand

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.490 
good test is to be able to put your hand
on<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.160> if<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.910> feels<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.599> barely<00:03:35.200> warm

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
on it if it feels just barely warm

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.039 
on it if it feels just barely warm
you've<00:03:35.769> got<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.129> right<00:03:36.310> amount<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.819> heat<00:03:37.060> into

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
you've got the right amount of heat into

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.380 
you've got the right amount of heat into
it<00:03:38.170> which<00:03:38.319> helps<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.799> puff<00:03:39.310> up<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> gloss<00:03:39.909> much

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
it which helps you puff up a gloss much

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.809 
it which helps you puff up a gloss much
quicker<00:03:40.690> than<00:03:41.019> if<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.260> kept<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> cold<00:03:41.829> if<00:03:42.519> it's

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
quicker than if you kept it cold if it's

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.699 
quicker than if you kept it cold if it's
too<00:03:43.030> hot<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.329> put<00:03:43.660> your<00:03:43.810> hand<00:03:43.989> on<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.560> keep

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
too hot to put your hand on and keep

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.759 
too hot to put your hand on and keep
there<00:03:44.950> from<00:03:45.450> anytime<00:03:46.450> at<00:03:46.660> all<00:03:46.810> then<00:03:47.560> you're

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
there from anytime at all then you're

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.860 
there from anytime at all then you're
running<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.190> risk<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.730> melting<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.599> lacquer

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
running the risk of melting the lacquer

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.839 
running the risk of melting the lacquer
and<00:03:50.319> putting<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.680> big<00:03:50.859> smear<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.730> it

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
and putting a big smear in and it

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.170 
and putting a big smear in and it
actually<00:03:51.879> makes<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.450> dull<00:03:52.660> finish<00:03:54.180> that's

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
actually makes a dull finish that's

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.079 
actually makes a dull finish that's
about<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.629> hope<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.930> was<00:03:56.049> helpful
