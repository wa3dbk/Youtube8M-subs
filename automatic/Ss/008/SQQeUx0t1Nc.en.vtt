cascading cascading spot loves to use

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.100 
cascading cascading spot loves to use

a<00:02:56.200> while

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
a while

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.590 
a while
cascading<00:02:57.430> would<00:02:57.730> happen<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.120> one<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.390> them

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
cascading would happen to be one of them

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.560 
cascading would happen to be one of them
but<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.320> can<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.830> spots<00:03:00.370> cascading<00:03:01.180> down

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
but you can see the spots cascading down

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
Sully's back down into his tail he's got

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.000 
Sully's back down into his tail he's got
some<00:03:04.660> nice<00:03:04.780> spikes<00:03:05.140> going<00:03:05.380> on<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.830> tail

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
some nice spikes going on in the tail

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.280 
some nice spikes going on in the tail
too<00:03:06.190> now<00:03:06.340> because<00:03:06.580> his<00:03:06.730> tail<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.120> poseable<00:03:07.720> you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
too now because his tail is poseable you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.560 
too now because his tail is poseable you
can't<00:03:08.530> rotate<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.130> tail<00:03:09.340> but<00:03:09.880> unfortunately

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
can't rotate the tail but unfortunately

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.720 
can't rotate the tail but unfortunately
it<00:03:10.660> will<00:03:10.840> offset<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.800> it'll<00:03:11.950> throw<00:03:12.220> off<00:03:12.400> these

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
it will offset and it'll throw off these

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.850 
it will offset and it'll throw off these
the<00:03:13.239> flow<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.750> spikes<00:03:14.110> coming<00:03:14.380> down<00:03:14.620> so

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
the flow of the spikes coming down so

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.650 
the flow of the spikes coming down so
really<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.700> might<00:03:15.850> want<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.239> leave<00:03:16.330> it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
really you might want to just leave it

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.750 
really you might want to just leave it
as<00:03:16.810> such<00:03:19.680> where<00:03:20.680> his<00:03:20.830> articulation<00:03:21.130> lies

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
as such where his articulation lies

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.640 
as such where his articulation lies

but<00:04:20.829> still<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.910> can<00:04:22.060> get<00:04:22.180> some<00:04:22.390> really<00:04:22.600> nice

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
but still you can get some really nice

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.020 
but still you can get some really nice
poses<00:04:23.800> out<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.160> solving<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.640> mean<00:04:24.760> even<00:04:24.970> though

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
poses out of solving I mean even though

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.469 
poses out of solving I mean even though
he's<00:04:25.240> not<00:04:25.390> necessarily<00:04:26.380> scaring<00:04:27.310> anybody<00:04:27.760> you

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
he's not necessarily scaring anybody you

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.300 
he's not necessarily scaring anybody you
can<00:04:28.630> kind<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:29.020> his<00:04:29.169> arms<00:04:29.500> up<00:04:29.680> almost<00:04:29.979> as

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
can kind of have his arms up almost as

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.990 
can kind of have his arms up almost as
if<00:04:30.460> he's<00:04:30.580> gonna<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:31.800> sneaking<00:04:32.800> up<00:04:33.100> on<00:04:33.460> any

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
if he's gonna be sneaking up on any

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.840 
if he's gonna be sneaking up on any
suspecting<00:04:35.100> unsuspecting<00:04:36.100> monster<00:04:36.640> or

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
suspecting unsuspecting monster or

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.610 
suspecting unsuspecting monster or
person<00:04:37.470> sneaking<00:04:38.470> up<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:39.340> at<00:04:40.210> least<00:04:40.510> spook<00:04:41.229> not

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
person sneaking up to at least spook not

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.020 
person sneaking up to at least spook not
necessarily<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.310> scare

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
necessarily a scare

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.570 
necessarily a scare
a<00:04:43.060> little<00:04:43.780> more<00:04:43.990> at<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.260> spook<00:04:44.680> were<00:04:44.860> sitting<00:04:45.460> at

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
a little more at a spook were sitting at

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.180 
a little more at a spook were sitting at
a<00:04:45.610> spook<00:04:46.150> level<00:04:46.570> not<00:04:47.020> necessarily<00:04:47.530> at<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.680> scare

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
a spook level not necessarily at a scare

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.540 
a spook level not necessarily at a scare
level<00:04:49.710> but<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.860> think<00:04:51.039> they<00:04:51.099> did<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.280> really<00:04:51.430> good

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
level but I think they did a really good

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.089 
level but I think they did a really good
job<00:04:51.669> on<00:04:51.970> he's<00:04:52.240> nice<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:52.690> small<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:53.890> he's<00:04:54.010> not

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
job on he's nice and small so he's not

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.740 
job on he's nice and small so he's not
gonna<00:04:54.220> take<00:04:54.490> up<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.700> lot<00:04:54.849> of<00:04:54.880> space<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.360> guess<00:04:55.390> as

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
gonna take up a lot of space I guess as

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.310 
gonna take up a lot of space I guess as
you<00:04:55.810> can<00:04:56.080> see

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
you can see

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.410 
you can see
one<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.530> his<00:04:56.650> other<00:04:57.190> problems<00:04:57.910> which

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
one of his other problems which

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.440 
one of his other problems which
hopefully<00:04:58.900> may<00:04:59.170> be<00:04:59.230> correcting<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.830> tail

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
hopefully may be correcting the tail

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.930 
hopefully may be correcting the tail
might<00:05:01.450> fix<00:05:01.810> maybe<00:05:02.230> not<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.680> guess<00:05:03.520> having<00:05:03.760> the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
might fix maybe not I guess having the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.830 
might fix maybe not I guess having the
arms<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.330> little<00:05:04.600> too<00:05:04.840> high<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:06.480> you<00:05:07.480> might<00:05:07.660> have

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
arms a little too high up you might have

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.210 
arms a little too high up you might have
the<00:05:07.930> risk<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.230> him<00:05:08.410> falling<00:05:08.800> over<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.040> guess

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
the risk of him falling over I guess

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.800 
the risk of him falling over I guess
once<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.460> have<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.730> arms<00:05:09.940> high<00:05:10.150> enough<00:05:10.390> it

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
once you have the arms high enough it

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.310 
once you have the arms high enough it
may<00:05:10.960> not<00:05:11.080> be<00:05:11.260> too<00:05:11.410> big<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.650> an<00:05:11.710> issue<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:14.020> spot

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
may not be too big of an issue that spot

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.400 
may not be too big of an issue that spot
indicated<00:05:14.560> he's<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.310> nice<00:05:15.520> small<00:05:16.000> size<00:05:16.380> he<00:05:17.380> is
