00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
you're watching this I'm put it to

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
you're watching this I'm put it to
youtube<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.770> can<00:03:07.920> watch<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.250> youtube<00:03:08.550> but

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
youtube so you can watch on youtube but

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.800 
youtube so you can watch on youtube but
it's<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.240> going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> same

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it's not going to be the same

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.480 
it's not going to be the same
interactivity<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:10.709> least<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.980> don't<00:03:11.160> think

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
interactivity at least I don't think

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.340 
interactivity at least I don't think
I'll<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.270> when<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.540> gets<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.840> youtube<00:03:13.170> but

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
