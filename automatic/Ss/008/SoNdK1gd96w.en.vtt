it has coil over ignition that is shared
with<00:00:31.830> another<00:00:31.859> plug<00:00:32.750> your<00:00:33.750> spark<00:00:34.020> plugs<00:00:34.290> are

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
with another plug your spark plugs are

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.940 
with another plug your spark plugs are
located<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.100> each<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.550> these<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:37.800> you'll

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
located in each of these so what you'll

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.110 
located in each of these so what you'll
need<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.430> you'll<00:00:38.579> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> pull<00:00:38.969> off

need to do is you'll want to pull off

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.420 
need to do is you'll want to pull off
the<00:00:39.329> ignition<00:00:39.480> coil<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.340> an

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the ignition coil I like to do an

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.799 
the ignition coil I like to do an
extension<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.600> spin

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
extension because then I can just spin

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
extension because then I can just spin
it<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.460> they've<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it like that and then they've got a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.319 
it like that and then they've got a
magnet<00:00:45.270> dish<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.719> catch<00:00:45.930> stuff<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.149> just

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
magnet dish to catch stuff but you just

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
magnet dish to catch stuff but you just
want<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> pull<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> coils<00:00:49.320> off<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.430> do

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
want to pull the coils off and as you do

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
want to pull the coils off and as you do
so<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> twist<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.629> back<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> forth

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so you want to twist them back and forth

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
so you want to twist them back and forth
the<00:00:53.129> plastic<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> gets<00:00:54.120> stuck<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.600> there

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the plastic kind of gets stuck on there

because I'm doing this one first I'll

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
because I'm doing this one first I'll
unplug<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:58.020> push<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.410> I'll<00:00:58.710> push

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920

when<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:01.949> gonna<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:03.449> wires<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
when you're gonna do the wires for it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
when you're gonna do the wires for it
you<00:01:04.799> want<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> twist<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.460> back<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> forth

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you want to twist them back and forth

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
you want to twist them back and forth
what<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.350> gotta<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.619> careful

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
because you don't want to cut this part

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.289 
because you don't want to cut this part
of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> wire<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.229> grab<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.770> gently<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> twist

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
of the wire but grab it gently and twist

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.010 
of the wire but grab it gently and twist
back<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> forth<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.659> then<00:01:15.659> start

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
back and forth like that and then start

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
back and forth like that and then start
to<00:01:16.170> pull<00:01:16.409> after<00:01:16.830> you've<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> good<00:01:17.400> twist<00:01:17.700> on

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to pull after you've got a good twist on

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.289 
to pull after you've got a good twist on
it<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.979> then<00:01:19.979> that'll<00:01:20.250> come<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.460> your

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it and then that'll come up your

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
it and then that'll come up your
ignition<00:01:21.600> coil<00:01:22.110> over<00:01:22.619> should<00:01:23.159> come<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.549> pretty

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
ignition coil over should come up pretty

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.060 
ignition coil over should come up pretty
easy<00:01:24.030> without<00:01:24.479> having<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> twist<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.650> then

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
easy without having to twist and then

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
easy without having to twist and then
you've<00:01:26.549> got<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:26.970> bracket<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.720> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you've got a little bracket for that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
you've got a little bracket for that
wire<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.590> side<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.850> pull<00:01:30.090> these

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
wire on the back side so you pull these

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
wire on the back side so you pull these
up<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.950> works<00:01:32.189> every

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
up and you can see how that works every

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.499 
up and you can see how that works every
time<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.630> fires<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.439> fires<00:01:34.770> so

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
time this one fires this one fires so

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
time this one fires this one fires so
when<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.869> fires<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.590> its<00:01:37.770> top<00:01:38.100> dead

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
when this one fires for its top dead

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.210 
when this one fires for its top dead
center<00:01:38.670> stroke<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.689> gonna<00:01:39.960> ignite<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.979> air

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
center stroke it's gonna ignite the air

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
center stroke it's gonna ignite the air
fuel<00:01:41.430> mixture<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.869> fire<00:01:43.049> at

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
fuel mixture and this one will fire at

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590

on there get a little feel for it and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.820 
on there get a little feel for it and
then<00:02:14.190> crack<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.690> if<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.080> incredibly

stuck you want to use a Messi's on your
spark<00:02:22.290> plugs<00:02:22.590> I'll<00:02:23.220> show<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.730> is

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
spark plugs I'll show you what that is

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.839 
spark plugs I'll show you what that is
in<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.090> minute<00:02:24.319> but<00:02:25.319> why<00:02:26.099> do<00:02:26.160> as<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.489> straighten

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
in a minute but why do as I straighten

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.789 
in a minute but why do as I straighten
my<00:02:26.879> shoulders<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.599> like<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.650> way

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
my shoulders out like this and that way

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.740 
my shoulders out like this and that way
I<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.400> lean<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.599> way<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I just kind of lean it and that way I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.809 
I just kind of lean it and that way I
can<00:02:31.019> really<00:02:31.140> control<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> force<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.280> kind<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
can really control the force and kind of

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.940 
can really control the force and kind of
get<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> feel<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.810> also<00:02:33.959> go<00:02:34.319> as<00:02:34.440> high<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
get a feel but also go as high in the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.020 
get a feel but also go as high in the
force<00:02:35.250> category<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.390> need<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:37.730> I'll<00:02:38.730> crack

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
force category as I need to I'll crack

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.059 
force category as I need to I'll crack
that<00:02:39.239> one<00:02:39.510> crack<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.019> other<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.950> then

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
that one crack this other one and then

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.830 
that one crack this other one and then
spin<00:02:41.400> them<00:02:43.069> here<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.099> break

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
spin them here that break

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.630 
spin them here that break
that's<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.930> mechanical<00:02:46.530> weld<00:02:46.769> caused<00:02:47.280> by

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's a mechanical weld caused by

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:58.580 
that's a mechanical weld caused by
electrolysis<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.900> if<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.019> spin<00:02:58.290> your<00:02:58.410> ratchet

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
electrolysis so if you spin your ratchet

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.350 
electrolysis so if you spin your ratchet
watch<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.370> your<00:02:59.519> sensors<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.120> stuff

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
watch out for your sensors and stuff

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.569 
watch out for your sensors and stuff
because<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.620> some<00:03:01.769> old<00:03:02.010> plastic

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
because if you have some old plastic

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.400 
because if you have some old plastic
stuff<00:03:02.879> underhood<00:03:03.360> sometimes<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.049> can<00:03:04.200> break

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
stuff underhood sometimes it can break

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.530 
stuff underhood sometimes it can break
oh<00:03:05.900> gentle<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:08.519> do<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.150> pulls<00:03:09.359> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
oh gentle you do that and it pulls the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.590 
oh gentle you do that and it pulls the
plug<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.859> NGK<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.940> good<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> lot<00:03:12.510> of

this<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:41.220> gonna<00:03:41.549> go<00:03:41.849> crack<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.599> it's<00:03:42.780> not

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
this it's gonna go crack but it's not

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.979 
this it's gonna go crack but it's not
gonna<00:03:43.109> take<00:03:43.380> anywhere<00:03:43.799> near<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.310> much<00:03:44.489> force

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
gonna take anywhere near as much force

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.509 
gonna take anywhere near as much force

look<00:04:06.000> at<00:04:06.120> one<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.359> these<00:04:06.480> plugs<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:08.190> see

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
look at one of these plugs you can see

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.819 
look at one of these plugs you can see
it's<00:04:08.489> got<00:04:08.669> a<00:04:08.700> little<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.389> crush<00:04:10.350> washer

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
it's got a little bit of a crush washer

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.280 
it's got a little bit of a crush washer
on<00:04:11.009> it<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.630> you'll<00:04:12.780> want<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.049> crush<00:04:13.259> that

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
on it and so you'll want to crush that

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.280 
on it and so you'll want to crush that
down<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> little<00:04:13.979> bit<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.459> have<00:04:14.549> good<00:04:14.759> tight

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
down a little bit so you have good tight

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.080 
down a little bit so you have good tight
pression<00:04:15.739> but<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.639> don't<00:04:16.820> want<00:04:17.000> to

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
pression but you don't want to

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.610 
pression but you don't want to
over-tighten<00:04:17.389> here<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.019> can<00:04:18.169> strip<00:04:18.440> the

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
over-tighten here you can strip the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.949 
over-tighten here you can strip the
plugs<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.609> create<00:04:20.120> some<00:04:20.359> problems<00:04:20.780> for

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
plugs and create some problems for

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.939 
plugs and create some problems for
yourself<00:04:21.639> so<00:04:22.639> I'm<00:04:22.759> gonna<00:04:22.880> do<00:04:23.000> one<00:04:23.150> more<00:04:23.180> plug

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
yourself so I'm gonna do one more plug

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.200 
yourself so I'm gonna do one more plug
and<00:04:24.949> then<00:04:25.160> we're<00:04:25.280> gonna<00:04:25.430> button<00:04:25.699> not<00:04:26.000> this

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
and then we're gonna button not this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.200 
and then we're gonna button not this
side<00:04:26.509> and<00:04:27.460> that'll<00:04:28.460> be<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.669> video<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:31.210> Matt

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
side and that'll be the video of it Matt

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.950 
side and that'll be the video of it Matt
wasn't<00:04:32.419> there

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
wasn't there

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.760 
wasn't there
that's<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.410> videographer<00:04:37.810> tool<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:39.500> my

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
that's the videographer tool like my

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.040 
that's the videographer tool like my
sock<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.250> didn't<00:04:40.520> pick<00:04:40.699> that<00:04:40.729> one<00:04:41.030> up<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.479> I<00:04:41.810> go

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
sock it didn't pick that one up so I go

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.469 
sock it didn't pick that one up so I go
to<00:04:42.110> stick<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.500> tool<00:04:42.680> down<00:04:42.919> there<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.970> pick<00:04:44.330> it

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
to stick the tool down there and pick it

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:54.040 
to stick the tool down there and pick it
out<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.810> way<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:49.720> say<00:04:50.720> Matt<00:04:50.930> but<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:53.810> can't

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
out that way so say Matt but I can't

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.200 
out that way so say Matt but I can't
decide<00:04:54.289> what<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.560> kite<00:04:55.039> Matt<00:04:55.280> Matt<00:04:56.090> was

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
decide what the kite Matt Matt was

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.610 
decide what the kite Matt Matt was
asking<00:04:56.389> me<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:56.810> know<00:04:56.900> what<00:04:57.080> if<00:04:57.199> it<00:04:57.320> won't<00:04:57.440> come

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
asking me you know what if it won't come

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.710 
asking me you know what if it won't come
out<00:04:58.009> what<00:04:58.190> if<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.400> go<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.580> do<00:04:58.759> it<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.270> feels

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
out what if you go to do it and it feels

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.570 
out what if you go to do it and it feels
like<00:04:59.990> you're<00:05:00.169> dragging<00:05:00.470> metal<00:05:01.070> or<00:05:01.250> stripping

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
like you're dragging metal or stripping

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.430 
like you're dragging metal or stripping
or<00:05:01.880> doing<00:05:02.090> something<00:05:02.389> like<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.570> if<00:05:03.229> that's

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
or doing something like that if that's

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.629 
or doing something like that if that's
the<00:05:03.650> case<00:05:03.860> then<00:05:04.099> you<00:05:04.190> want<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.460> use<00:05:04.550> a

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
the case then you want to use a

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.770 
the case then you want to use a
penetrating<00:05:05.240> oil

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
penetrating oil

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.379 
penetrating oil
I<00:05:05.930> recommend<00:05:06.500> PB<00:05:06.710> Blaster<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.910> works<00:05:08.120> really

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
I recommend PB Blaster it works really

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.150 
I recommend PB Blaster it works really
well<00:05:08.539> get<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.289> move<00:05:09.410> just<00:05:09.650> a<00:05:09.770> little<00:05:09.800> bit

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
well get it to move just a little bit

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.159 
well get it to move just a little bit
drag<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> little<00:05:10.880> bit<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.419> then<00:05:11.630> squirt<00:05:11.900> some

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
drag a little bit and then squirt some

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.379 
drag a little bit and then squirt some
down<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.590> hole<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:12.979> then<00:05:13.550> let<00:05:13.789> it<00:05:13.910> sit<00:05:14.150> for<00:05:14.180> a

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
down the hole and then let it sit for a

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.300 
down the hole and then let it sit for a
little<00:05:14.449> bit<00:05:14.750> sometimes<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.289> warm<00:05:15.620> engine<00:05:16.130> is

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
little bit sometimes a warm engine is

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.430 
little bit sometimes a warm engine is
easier<00:05:16.759> to<00:05:16.910> get<00:05:17.060> stuck<00:05:17.419> plugs<00:05:17.720> out<00:05:17.960> of<00:05:18.139> than<00:05:18.349> a

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
easier to get stuck plugs out of than a

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.950 
easier to get stuck plugs out of than a
cold<00:05:18.680> one<00:05:18.949> so<00:05:19.849> you<00:05:20.270> might<00:05:20.449> want<00:05:20.659> to<00:05:20.690> have<00:05:20.840> the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
cold one so you might want to have the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.390 
cold one so you might want to have the
vehicle<00:05:21.139> nice<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.710> warm<00:05:21.889> when<00:05:21.949> you<00:05:22.159> go<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.310> a

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
vehicle nice and warm when you go to a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.430 
vehicle nice and warm when you go to a
temp<00:05:22.669> dip<00:05:22.909> so<00:05:23.680> those<00:05:24.680> are<00:05:24.860> nice<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:25.250> tight

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
temp dip so those are nice and tight

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.600 
temp dip so those are nice and tight
another<00:05:27.440> thing<00:05:27.710> that's<00:05:27.830> good<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.250> put<00:05:28.430> on

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
another thing that's good to put on

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
these things I've got a little pouch of

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.680 
these things I've got a little pouch of
it<00:05:39.620> but<00:05:39.770> what<00:05:39.889> I<00:05:39.919> like<00:05:40.159> to<00:05:40.340> do<00:05:40.520> is<00:05:41.150> I'll<00:05:41.300> take<00:05:41.479> it

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
it but what I like to do is I'll take it

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.300 
it but what I like to do is I'll take it
and<00:05:41.780> then<00:05:41.930> just<00:05:42.110> do<00:05:42.229> a<00:05:42.260> little<00:05:42.440> bridge<00:05:42.800> across

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
and then just do a little bridge across

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.029 
and then just do a little bridge across
the<00:05:43.610> plug<00:05:44.449> wire<00:05:45.039> and<00:05:46.039> what<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.400> does<00:05:46.720> is<00:05:48.039> it

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
the plug wire and what that does is it

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.010 
the plug wire and what that does is it
causes<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.639> very<00:05:49.849> tip<00:05:50.150> of<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.360> plug<00:05:50.599> to<00:05:50.870> not

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
causes the very tip of the plug to not

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.439 
causes the very tip of the plug to not
seize<00:05:51.470> onto<00:05:51.979> the<00:05:52.130> bracket<00:05:52.729> in<00:05:53.060> there<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.360> it

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
seize onto the bracket in there so it

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.360 
seize onto the bracket in there so it
doesn't<00:05:53.599> rip<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.960> bracket<00:05:54.349> out<00:05:54.470> but<00:05:55.099> it<00:05:55.220> also

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
doesn't rip the bracket out but it also

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.550 
doesn't rip the bracket out but it also
lubricates<00:05:56.090> around<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.539> porcelain<00:05:57.110> portion

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
lubricates around the porcelain portion

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.770 
lubricates around the porcelain portion
of<00:05:57.680> this<00:05:57.889> mark<00:05:58.159> plug<00:05:59.139> is<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:02.000> metal<00:06:02.300> part<00:06:02.539> can

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
of this mark plug is the metal part can

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.020 
of this mark plug is the metal part can
get<00:06:02.930> seized<00:06:03.229> into<00:06:03.650> where<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.099> little<00:06:04.370> clip<00:06:04.789> is

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
get seized into where the little clip is

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.180 
get seized into where the little clip is
but<00:06:05.449> also<00:06:05.599> the<00:06:05.930> porcelain<00:06:06.409> can<00:06:06.620> get<00:06:06.770> stuck<00:06:07.039> to

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
but also the porcelain can get stuck to

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.210 
but also the porcelain can get stuck to
the<00:06:07.280> rubber<00:06:07.490> so<00:06:08.360> if<00:06:08.479> you<00:06:08.570> do<00:06:08.720> that<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.289> give<00:06:10.190> it

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
the rubber so if you do that and give it

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.700 
the rubber so if you do that and give it
a<00:06:10.340> little<00:06:10.490> twist<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:11.599> covers<00:06:11.990> around<00:06:12.139> both<00:06:12.680> of

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
a little twist it covers around both of

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.180 
a little twist it covers around both of
them<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.310> where<00:06:13.490> you're<00:06:13.699> in<00:06:13.820> good<00:06:13.970> shape<00:06:14.030> so<00:06:18.190> at

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
them to where you're in good shape so at

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.800 
them to where you're in good shape so at
least<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:19.550> can<00:06:19.729> see<00:06:19.940> what<00:06:20.060> I'm<00:06:20.180> talking<00:06:20.539> about

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
least you can see what I'm talking about

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.659 
least you can see what I'm talking about
those<00:06:21.320> are<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.560> two<00:06:21.740> ways<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.340> know<00:06:22.430> if

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
those are the two ways and you know if

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.180 
those are the two ways and you know if
you<00:06:22.849> get<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.180> boot<00:06:23.360> part<00:06:23.750> stuck<00:06:24.050> on<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.469> plug

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
you get the boot part stuck on the plug

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.339 
you get the boot part stuck on the plug
sometimes<00:06:25.940> these<00:06:26.150> will<00:06:26.360> pull<00:06:26.570> off<00:06:26.779> of<00:06:27.050> here

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
sometimes these will pull off of here

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.780 
sometimes these will pull off of here
and<00:06:27.500> stick<00:06:28.190> on<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.490> plug

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
and stick on the plug

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.040 
and stick on the plug
and<00:06:28.880> then<00:06:28.970> you<00:06:29.060> can't<00:06:29.270> get<00:06:29.390> your<00:06:29.480> socket<00:06:29.930> on

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
and then you can't get your socket on

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.540 
and then you can't get your socket on
it's<00:06:30.260> stuck<00:06:30.530> down<00:06:30.710> in<00:06:30.920> there<00:06:31.100> and<00:06:31.160> you<00:06:31.220> have<00:06:31.400> to

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
it's stuck down in there and you have to

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.090 
it's stuck down in there and you have to
fish<00:06:31.730> it<00:06:31.910> out<00:06:32.060> so<00:06:32.560> when<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.740> do<00:06:33.800> these<00:06:34.040> things

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
fish it out so when I do these things

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.880 
fish it out so when I do these things
most<00:06:34.970> of<00:06:35.180> my<00:06:35.300> customers<00:06:35.540> are<00:06:36.050> customers<00:06:36.260> for

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
most of my customers are customers for

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:37.750 
most of my customers are customers for
the<00:06:37.010> long<00:06:37.190> haul

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
the long haul

plus it's just good practice and it's
good<00:06:53.870> karma<00:06:57.520> plug<00:06:58.520> it<00:06:58.670> in<00:07:00.460> we'll<00:07:01.460> be<00:07:01.550> good<00:07:01.700> to

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
good karma plug it in we'll be good to

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.820 
good karma plug it in we'll be good to
go<00:07:04.570> something<00:07:05.570> to<00:07:05.750> watch<00:07:05.930> for<00:07:05.960> if<00:07:06.470> you've<00:07:06.620> got

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.800 
go something to watch for if you've got
bad<00:07:07.130> plug<00:07:07.580> wires<00:07:07.820> or<00:07:08.090> something<00:07:08.510> you'll<00:07:08.630> see<00:07:08.780> a

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
bad plug wires or something you'll see a

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.440 
bad plug wires or something you'll see a
lot<00:07:09.050> of<00:07:09.080> white<00:07:09.350> build<00:07:09.680> up<00:07:09.910> these<00:07:10.910> don't<00:07:11.180> have<00:07:11.420> a

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
lot of white build up these don't have a

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.000 
lot of white build up these don't have a
lot<00:07:11.720> of<00:07:11.870> its<00:07:12.050> I<00:07:12.200> can't<00:07:12.440> really<00:07:12.680> show<00:07:12.860> you<00:07:12.890> what

lot of its I can't really show you what

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.710 
lot of its I can't really show you what
it<00:07:13.220> looks<00:07:13.400> like<00:07:13.610> anywhere<00:07:14.000> they<00:07:14.090> make<00:07:14.240> contact

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
it looks like anywhere they make contact

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.080 
it looks like anywhere they make contact
with<00:07:14.870> something<00:07:15.140> else<00:07:15.440> you'll<00:07:16.160> see<00:07:16.400> white

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
with something else you'll see white

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.150 

air<00:07:29.060> leaves<00:07:29.780> a<00:07:29.900> white<00:07:30.080> deposit<00:07:30.710> on<00:07:30.830> the<00:07:30.980> wire

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 
air leaves a white deposit on the wire

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.740 
air leaves a white deposit on the wire
and<00:07:31.610> that's<00:07:31.790> a<00:07:31.880> good<00:07:32.000> indication<00:07:32.390> that<00:07:32.630> you

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
and that's a good indication that you

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.690 
and that's a good indication that you
need<00:07:32.780> to<00:07:32.990> replace<00:07:33.230> your<00:07:33.470> wires<00:07:33.650> and<00:07:34.160> also<00:07:34.520> turn

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
need to replace your wires and also turn

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.280 
need to replace your wires and also turn
out<00:07:34.850> all<00:07:35.000> the<00:07:35.030> lights<00:07:35.150> and<00:07:35.630> have<00:07:35.750> the<00:07:35.900> car<00:07:36.080> just

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.290 
out all the lights and have the car just
