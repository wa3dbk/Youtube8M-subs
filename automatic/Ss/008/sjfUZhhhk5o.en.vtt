the<00:00:32.070> ride<00:00:32.309> itself<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:33.540> some<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.110> unique

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
the ride itself has some very unique

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
the ride itself has some very unique
technology<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.329> dual<00:00:36.719> launch<00:00:37.079> roller

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
technology this is a dual launch roller

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
technology this is a dual launch roller
coaster<00:00:38.039> with<00:00:38.670> linear<00:00:39.000> synchronous<00:00:39.329> motors

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
coaster with linear synchronous motors

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.169 
coaster with linear synchronous motors
and<00:00:40.320> it'll<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.829> from<00:00:40.980> zero<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> its<00:00:41.760> top<00:00:42.000> speed

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
and it'll go from zero to its top speed

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.509 
and it'll go from zero to its top speed
very<00:00:42.750> quickly<00:00:42.839> oh<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.800> interesting<00:00:43.949> it's

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
very quickly oh it's interesting it's

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.150 
very quickly oh it's interesting it's
not<00:00:44.609> just<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.179> ride<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:46.440> also<00:00:46.679> have<00:00:47.039> an

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
not just the ride we also have an

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970 
not just the ride we also have an
incredible<00:00:47.550> animal<00:00:48.329> exhibit<00:00:48.809> tied<00:00:49.589> into<00:00:49.769> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
incredible animal exhibit tied into this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.119 
incredible animal exhibit tied into this
ride<00:00:50.249> as<00:00:50.550> only<00:00:51.210> SeaWorld<00:00:51.629> could<00:00:51.809> provide<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
ride as only SeaWorld could provide so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.619 
ride as only SeaWorld could provide so
guests<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.760> able<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> walk<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.269> up<00:00:54.600> to

this wall get their hands in the water

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
this wall get their hands in the water
we<00:00:56.909> think<00:00:57.120> it'll<00:00:57.269> be<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.449> great<00:00:57.600> experience<00:00:57.719> for

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
we think it'll be a great experience for

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.229 
we think it'll be a great experience for
children<00:00:58.519> they're<00:00:59.519> gonna<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.879> viewing

children they're gonna have viewing

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.059 
children they're gonna have viewing
panels<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.839> see<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.170> Rays<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.409> fishes

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
panels to see the Rays and fishes

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.939 
panels to see the Rays and fishes
underwater<00:01:03.019> where<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> light<00:01:04.589> coming

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
underwater where you see a light coming

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
underwater where you see a light coming
through<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> top<00:01:05.519> will<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.360> be

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
through in the top will actually be

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.630 
through in the top will actually be
filled<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.900> water<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> you'll<00:01:08.190> have<00:01:08.400> rays

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
filled with water and you'll have rays

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960 
filled with water and you'll have rays
and<00:01:09.030> fishes<00:01:10.020> swimming<00:01:10.710> above<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.790> see

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and fishes swimming above what you see

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
and fishes swimming above what you see
here<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.570> call<00:01:12.840> transfer<00:01:13.410> tracks

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here are what we call transfer tracks

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.270 
here are what we call transfer tracks
and<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.480> where<00:01:15.660> we<00:01:15.840> move<00:01:16.080> trains<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and that is where we move trains on and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
and that is where we move trains on and
off<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.760> ride<00:01:17.910> system<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.440> tracks

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
off of the ride system so these tracks

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190 
off of the ride system so these tracks
will<00:01:19.980> come<00:01:20.160> out<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> car<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.720> train<00:01:21.990> in

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
will come out put the car the train in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
will come out put the car the train in
position<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> track<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.370> that<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.550> can

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
position on the track so that it can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.690 
position on the track so that it can
begin<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> ride<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:25.260> this<00:01:25.740> great<00:01:26.490> big

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
begin the ride but this this great big

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
begin the ride but this this great big
building<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.300> see<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.890> has

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
building that you see right here has

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550 
building that you see right here has
some<00:01:29.850> technology<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:30.840> never<00:01:31.290> been

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
some technology that's really never been

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920 
some technology that's really never been
used<00:01:31.770> before<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> ride<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.910> we<00:01:33.750> have

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
used before on a ride like this we have

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.570 
used before on a ride like this we have
a<00:01:34.280> 270<00:01:35.280> degree<00:01:35.660> enveloping<00:01:36.660> screen<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:38.370> ride

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
a 270 degree enveloping screen the ride

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.940 
a 270 degree enveloping screen the ride
is<00:01:38.760> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> move<00:01:39.330> out<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.990> move<00:01:40.650> into

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
is going to move out of here move into

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.910 
is going to move out of here move into
this<00:01:41.190> show<00:01:41.460> building<00:01:41.910> with<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> 270<00:01:43.620> degree

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
this show building with this 270 degree

enveloping screen around it and then a

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.070 
enveloping screen around it and then a
production<00:01:47.400> will<00:01:47.610> begin<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
production will begin that actually

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.260 
production will begin that actually
makes<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.530> feel<00:01:49.800> on<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.160> train<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.970> if

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you're the Rey underwater you'll see

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.300 
you're the Rey underwater you'll see
life-size<00:01:54.090> images<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.080> other<00:01:55.560> rays<00:01:55.920> and

you on this screen to make you feel as

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.460 
you on this screen to make you feel as
if<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.450> underwater<00:02:03.930> moving

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
if you're you're underwater moving

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.359 
if you're you're underwater moving
moving<00:02:04.980> just<00:02:05.160> like<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.550> Ray<00:02:05.700> would<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.240> then

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
moving just like the Ray would and then
