00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello friends this time we're 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.440
 in front of your hair 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.740
 of the second culture onions like 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.220
 I named them on the left you have 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.650
 the tomato plants awesome how are they 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.630
 we want them to continue like this and on the right the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.840
 bancal of the entire SMEs 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.230
 some tomato plants 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 let's see the padding the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 results of applying the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 quilting technique 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 and so you can see the difference 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.370
 we have the street on the right / 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.020
 tomatoes and onions with padding and 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.970
 onions the tomato plants are also 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.070
 padded although not appreciated 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.970
 because the plant the plants cover everything 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.510
 the bench 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.520
 but if in the onions and how can you 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.580
 easily observe where they are 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 weeds in the in the area 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.530
 padded in the rows that are glued 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.220
 you will have more humidity and where there 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.310
 space with less amount of grass and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.700
 that there is more luminosity and space for 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.170
 that are developed be for herbs 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.409
 and as you can see on the horse or on the bench 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.649
 of dedicated to pimentel so tomateras 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.270
 in the superficial crust prevents it from 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.100
 greatly develop weeds 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.939
 but 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.229
 not so on the street between terraces that 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.460
 you can see that it looks like 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.250
 seeded with some grass 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 the plants are not removed and the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.600
 difference between 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.870
 There are padded and almost alcohol-free char 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.880
 It is remarkable 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.960
 I did not want to pull more grass for 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.330
 that you could see what the step will be 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.680
 after showing the video to avoid 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 that the weeds go up for me 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.860
 on top of the plants that I have 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.600
 cultivated 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.640
 we will have to take a step with the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.470
 Brushcutter surely because by hand 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.580
 It will take a long time to be fatal 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.350
 and will proceed with a lot of colching 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:17.640
 amount of straw or dry grass to 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.970
 try to prevent these from developing 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 weeds 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.530
 could use the local herbicide 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.060
 but of bell for the backpack and it gives me 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 very much fear applies especially in 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420
 streets because with a little bit that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.240
 move to the air while it is being done 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.970
 the herbicide treatment can be 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.040
 derive the product to the crops that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.090
 I have next door and load all the work 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.090
 what have I done 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.270
 good friends if you find it interesting 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.489
 You already know how to subscribe to my channel 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.970
 I like it and I will continue to see what it is 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.800
 interesting to perform this kind of 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.280
 videos thank you very much and until another 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.280
 chance
