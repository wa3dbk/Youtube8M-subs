in<00:03:04.520> levels<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.210> hard<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.780> find<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.200> have<00:03:06.350> to

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
in levels it's hard to find you have to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.230 
in levels it's hard to find you have to

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
make decisions on your own but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.820 
make decisions on your own but
eventually<00:03:08.510> you'll<00:03:08.840> figure<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.620> level

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
eventually you'll figure out the level

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.010 
eventually you'll figure out the level
and<00:03:10.220> again<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.910> can<00:03:11.060> go<00:03:11.210> through<00:03:11.450> free<00:03:11.780> ride

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020
