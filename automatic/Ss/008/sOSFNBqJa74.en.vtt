got<00:03:11.700> some<00:03:11.850> nice<00:03:12.030> heat<00:03:12.270> sinks<00:03:12.690> up<00:03:12.870> here

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
got some nice heat sinks up here

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.500 
got some nice heat sinks up here
obviously<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.250> very<00:03:14.700> low<00:03:14.850> powered<00:03:15.239> board

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
obviously it's a very low powered board

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.090 
obviously it's a very low powered board
so<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.840> doesn't<00:03:16.140> really<00:03:16.230> need<00:03:16.470> massive<00:03:16.830> heat

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
so it doesn't really need massive heat

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.850 
so it doesn't really need massive heat
