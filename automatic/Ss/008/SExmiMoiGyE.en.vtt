00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Hi everyone! I'm glad to see you on my channel.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.200
Today I publish the answers to your questions to a trichologist.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Irina Popova is answering.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.380
She is a dermatologist, trichologist, President of Ukraine Trichologist Association.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.080
If you want to watch other publications with her participation, you should follow the playlist "Questions to a Trichologist".

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.460
A question: "Does hair really fall because of stress? What situations should be called as stress?"

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.280
They say, that hair falls in three months, because of stress. This is the craftiness.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.640
People not always can define, that hair falls because of stress, because 3 months have passed, everything seems to be OK.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.500
Stress is a cramp. Do you agree with me? Yes.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
In any case, stress is a cramp.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.840
I mean, it releases this component of stress in the form of a cramp and it starts to work for preterm hair change.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.880
What is the duration of change? 3 months? Yes. Approximately 100 days.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.480
So a person pays attention to it just at this time.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:05.840
That is why we usually ask about earlier diseases, about taking medication, about surgery with anaesthesia, about pregnancy, parturition, about ceasing of antifertility agents taking, because they cause change.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.220
And about frequent flights and movings and stresses.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.880
Moreover, women and girls arevery amenable to constant loss of iron.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.880
Anemia is our everything.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.900
It is when you get up and you have dizziness in the mornings, when you are short of power to do all the job to the end.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.040
It is a feeling of laziness, that sometimes pierces us - it can be the 1st sympthom of iron deficiency.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.400
What is stress with hair fall?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
Stress contains 3 main conditions, which hair reacts with cramp on.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.840
1. The loss of a very close and beloved person, you can't live without him.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.640
It is noy leaving, it is obviously departure from life.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.400
2 side - it is loss of big amount of money, the return of which can not be possible in the nearest future, and if this money is not yours.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.240
For example, stupid situation. You all know it.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.480
An accountant of a big enterprise with the aim to save money does not take taxi or company car.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.380
He goes to a bank, puts all the company salary into a bag and comes back by public transport.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.040
He just simply forgets the bag there.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.880
And 3rd strike - it is loss of the place of living.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.520
For example, you come to work. You have a passport and money in your bag, if you are lucky.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.280
You come back and there is no home.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.540
Or a husband has changed the lock and threw you out like a dog. It can happen.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.940
Love as stress, that causes hair fall. What is your opinion?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.380
Do you know, that love according to WHO relies to the groups of diseases.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.660
But it is false, of course.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660
But it is written in the Internet.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.480
So the feeling of love, especially without respond, it is very harsh stress.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.480
So, this is how stress looks like.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.240
After such stress hair falls very quickly.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.460
How quickly can hair fall?

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.420
It is stress, that we were talking about, it is quickly stress.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:03.320
2 - poisoning by the salts of heavy metals or poison, previous diseases with quickly rise of temperature: flue, malaria, typhus and so on.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.100
And acute blood loss, surgery, anaesthesia.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.040
So can we also loose hair after flue?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.120
Look. There is hair, that falls with dark follicle, and there is hair, that falls with light follicle. Do you remember?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.680
The most dangerous falling is falling with dark follicle.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.680
It is healthy, so it means sharp cramp and expulsion.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.980
With white follicle - it means exhausting, long, chronic fall.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.360
So, do you mean, that hair, thay should fall, falls with white follicle?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.200
Yes. Tell me please, who knows the norm of hair fall per one wash?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.800
The norms of fall/renewal of hair

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.640
They are  is 90-100 mainly in the Internet. Yes?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:45.360
Imagine, that you have approximately 15000 acting follicles on your head. Well, 15000.It is averagely.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.220
And you wash your head every day and count, that there are about 100 of them, well let it be 50.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.300
Multiply 50 by 30. How many? - 1500.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300
And multiply it by 12 months.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.300
And multiply it by 3 years.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.780
If they fall as it says in the norm, you will be bold in 3 years. Why?

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.160
Hair grows 1 sm per month. Do you imagine?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.240
So, this is myth.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.600
Because at some situation 1-2 hair cracks will fall.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.960
At the change period, when hair crack is changing, there will really 50-100 hair cracks fall.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.960
Sometimes up to 200.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960
Sometimes up to 300 per wash.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960
So this norm is absolutely different  for each person.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.900
It can be counted by a trichologist with the help of a special programm.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.420
He considers the denseness per 1 sm square, the speed of growth and the thickness of hair shaft.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560
Everyone has different characteristics.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560
After stress hair becomes thinner.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.800
It goes thick enough, then less, then more.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:52.000
If you take some vitamins for hair as biotine, for example, or microelements, it can be at once seen after what period the hair becomes thicker.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.100
You can compare, approximately how many months the person is taking this medicine.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.100
Question "Canities":
-early caniyies;
-children's canities'
- canities, caused by stress

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240
In the child age it can be genetic disposition.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.320
Mainly, there are, if you remember, dark moles.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.760
It is when on the dark-haired head of a man there is a light mob.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.480
It is like a mole, which behaved itself like that.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480
But because of fear - yes.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.480
There are very many theories.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.460
Later, if we have time, we will gather and talk about it.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.260
But mainly, early young canities in the teenager age is a genetic inborn condition.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.060
Second aspect is a disease of thyroid.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.080
As a rule, it can also be a lack of copper (enzymatic deficiency).

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.780
Sometimes there can be pathologies, that are connected with adrenals.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.780
So what do we do in such case?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.500
A trace element analysis of hair must be taken, it dissociates into trace elements.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.160
Cooper and zink are responsible for melanin, pigmentation.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.540
We define their amount in the blood serum or in the hair.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.860
If it is normal, and the analyses of thyroid and adrenals and so on are normal, so what can be done in such case?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.860
Only dyeing. That's all.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.740
You don't believe in anticanities and other different wheat germs, do you?

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.160
When should canities appear in general? At 30-40 years?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
You are a member of your race, clan.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.200
Can you imagine, what genetics has mixed in every person?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.780
Are stresses and nervousness connected to it?

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.800
Do you remember, for example, Marie Antoinette became grey before the execution, when she was decapitated? Right?

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.940
And so on and so on.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.320
As a matter of fact, the moments of canities are very disputable.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.300
This is the action of stress, it is oxidative stress for hair.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.620
But here is a moment, that we meet relatives we haven't seen for a long time due to some events, either happy or sad.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.880
Funerals, weddings, birth of children.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.880
We haven't seen them for a long time.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880
People live some life.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.860
These periods of time are very short in our memory.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.280
So, I haven't seen my cousin for 20 years.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.280
But she is so bright, charismatic.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.280
I remember her absolutely young.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280
I was that much astonished, when I saw her completely grey head.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.060
She grew old in my sight.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.440
And then I analyzed: yes, very much time had passed.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.080
That is why my conclusion: the terms of canities appear are strictly genetic, but it can be shown by trace element analysis.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.080
So, this is all.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.080
I consider, that Irina has explained many things.At least, for me for sure.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.080
We have many videos ahead.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:32.680
We will talk about combs, we will talk about the effectiveness of home-made shampoos, the effectiveness of home-made masks from the point of viev of medical practitioner - trichologist.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.240
And many-many more interesting videos.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:43.220
So, subscribe to our channel, if you haven't done it yet, put likes, comment, ask questions, answer, tell about your experience.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.220
We will meet in next videos.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.220
All the best! Bye-bye!
