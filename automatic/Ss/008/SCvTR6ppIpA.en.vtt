00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
you guys you worry about that or you

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.560 
you guys you worry about that or you
just<00:00:22.779> worry<00:00:23.080> about<00:00:23.340> trying<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.490> get<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.360> place

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
just worry about trying to get the place

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.109 
just worry about trying to get the place
straight<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.260> all<00:00:26.380> that<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.710> mean<00:00:27.610> is<00:00:27.850> really

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
straight and all that I mean is really

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.700 
straight and all that I mean is really
no<00:00:28.240> difference<00:00:28.690> because<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:29.350> know<00:00:29.470> just<00:00:29.590> like

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
no difference because you know just like

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.529 
no difference because you know just like
last<00:00:29.980> year<00:00:30.250> we<00:00:30.340> still<00:00:30.760> now<00:00:30.970> go<00:00:31.210> out<00:00:31.330> there<00:00:31.360> and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
last year we still now go out there and

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.930 
last year we still now go out there and
give<00:00:31.750> it<00:00:31.869> all<00:00:31.990> we<00:00:32.110> got<00:00:32.140> as<00:00:32.770> a<00:00:32.830> unit<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:33.520> I<00:00:33.760> think

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
give it all we got as a unit so I think

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.380 
give it all we got as a unit so I think
everything<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.420> pretty<00:00:34.570> much<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.780> same

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
everything is pretty much the same

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.610 
everything is pretty much the same
physically<00:00:37.390> do<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:37.660> feel<00:00:38.020> much<00:00:38.290> further

along now than you did when you came in
you<00:00:41.110> were<00:00:41.140> still<00:00:41.470> kind<00:00:41.770> of<00:00:41.860> coming<00:00:42.160> off<00:00:42.309> that

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
you were still kind of coming off that

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.060 
you were still kind of coming off that
injury<00:00:42.850> from<00:00:43.180> from<00:00:44.110> your<00:00:44.260> senior<00:00:44.620> year<00:00:44.680> do<00:00:44.979> you

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
injury from from your senior year do you

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
feel like you're quite a bit further

feel like you're quite a bit further
ahead<00:00:47.290> physically<00:00:48.010> than<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.280> were<00:00:48.430> when<00:00:48.610> you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
on things that you have better more for

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.700 
on things that you have better more for
obviously<00:01:13.390> if<00:01:13.570> like<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:14.140> know<00:01:14.290> something<00:01:14.470> I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
obviously if like you know something I

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.620 
obviously if like you know something I
don't<00:01:14.740> have<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.100> worry<00:01:15.280> about<00:01:15.370> any<00:01:15.670> more<00:01:15.910> like

don't have to worry about any more like

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.030 
don't have to worry about any more like
making<00:01:16.930> her<00:01:17.020> own<00:01:17.080> cut<00:01:17.410> would<00:01:17.560> hurt<00:01:17.740> my<00:01:17.890> ankle

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
making her own cut would hurt my ankle

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.220 
making her own cut would hurt my ankle
so<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.370> think<00:01:18.460> about<00:01:18.760> there<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.360> play<00:01:19.960> freely

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
so I think about there and play freely

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.890 
so I think about there and play freely
now<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:21.520> much<00:01:21.640> does<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.970> help<00:01:22.180> having<00:01:22.780> all

yes for me it's like the best situation
of<00:01:35.050> being<00:01:35.080> because<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:36.280> know<00:01:36.370> we<00:01:36.490> all<00:01:36.610> work

hard i'll give it a hundred and ten
percent<00:01:38.470> every<00:01:38.860> day<00:01:39.160> so<00:01:39.220> it's<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.580> we<00:01:39.730> all

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
percent every day so it's like we all

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.750 
percent every day so it's like we all

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
you probably an espadrille but just

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.460 
you probably an espadrille but just
speak<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.989> competitiveness<00:04:05.989> like<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
speak to the competitiveness like the

competitiveness<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.670> your<00:04:08.030> position<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
competitiveness that your position and

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.510 
competitiveness that your position and
just<00:04:08.840> um<00:04:09.110> how<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.590> approach<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.250> guess

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
just um how you approach that I guess

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.160 
just um how you approach that I guess
mentally<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.239> just<00:04:11.630> physically<00:04:11.930> all<00:04:12.050> the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
mentally and just physically all the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.290 
mentally and just physically all the
other<00:04:12.290> guys<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:12.860> figured<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.700> know<00:04:13.730> it's<00:04:14.090> just

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
other guys I figured you know it's just

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.120 
other guys I figured you know it's just
as<00:04:14.900> always<00:04:15.110> good<00:04:15.440> competition<00:04:15.800> we<00:04:16.040> had

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
as always good competition we had

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.590 
as always good competition we had
competition<00:04:16.640> in<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.790> back<00:04:16.940> field<00:04:17.150> last<00:04:17.390> year

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
competition in the back field last year

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.670 
competition in the back field last year
and<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.019> hasn't<00:04:18.140> changed<00:04:18.290> it's<00:04:18.650> still

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
and that hasn't changed it's still

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.949 
and that hasn't changed it's still
competition<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.579> backfield<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.690> think

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
competition in the backfield and I think

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.960 
competition in the backfield and I think
that's<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.440> good<00:04:21.859> thing<00:04:22.100> for<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.490> team<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:22.910> a

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
that's a good thing for the team as a

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.810 
that's a good thing for the team as a
whole<00:04:23.030> because<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:24.650> we're<00:04:25.280> still<00:04:25.490> competing

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
whole because it's we're still competing

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.640 
whole because it's we're still competing
but<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.750> team<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.050> getting<00:04:27.169> better<00:04:27.410> because

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
but the team is getting better because

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.040 
but the team is getting better because
we're<00:04:28.130> all<00:04:28.280> doing<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.730> things<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.300> what

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
we're all doing the things that what

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.570 
we're all doing the things that what
would<00:04:30.169> be<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.320> successful<00:04:30.740> spring<00:04:31.130> practice

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580
