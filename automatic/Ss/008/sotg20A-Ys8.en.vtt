00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
in this tutorial you will learn how to

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.900 
in this tutorial you will learn how to
set<00:00:02.399> an<00:00:02.490> alarm<00:00:02.610> on<00:00:03.120> iPhone<00:00:03.720> using<00:00:04.200> iOS<00:00:04.440> 7<00:00:05.220> alarm

set an alarm on iPhone using iOS 7 alarm
is<00:00:06.089> one<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.480> three<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.529> only

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
is one of the three and the only

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.980 
is one of the three and the only
reactive<00:00:08.460> mode<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.849> interaction<00:00:09.059> between<00:00:09.540> you

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
reactive mode of interaction between you

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.860 
reactive mode of interaction between you
and<00:00:10.290> your<00:00:10.410> phone<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.010> iOS<00:00:11.370> 7<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.450> directly

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
and your phone in iOS 7 it is directly

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.079 
and your phone in iOS 7 it is directly
related<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.590> clock<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.160> timer<00:00:14.519> functions

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
related to the clock in timer functions

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.120 
related to the clock in timer functions
and<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.929> how<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.139> can<00:00:16.379> set<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.680> up<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
and this is how you can set it up on the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.060 
and this is how you can set it up on the
iOS<00:00:17.340> 7<00:00:18.029> interface<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:19.230> are<00:00:19.410> essentially

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
iOS 7 interface there are essentially

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.519 
iOS 7 interface there are essentially
two<00:00:20.250> modes<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.000> accessing<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:22.380> are

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
two modes of accessing it as there are
