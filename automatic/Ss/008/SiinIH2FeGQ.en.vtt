00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.120 
pepper gives it a little bit of a richer
flavor<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.290> up<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.620> which<00:02:57.980> one

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
flavor and so it's up to you which one

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.479 
flavor and so it's up to you which one
you<00:02:58.190> want<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.489> use<00:02:59.110> so<00:03:00.110> just<00:03:01.010> add<00:03:01.130> your<00:03:01.340> wine

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
and just again bring up the heat and let

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.920 
and just again bring up the heat and let
that<00:03:03.800> burn<00:03:04.400> off<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.760> alcohol

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.869 

so<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.709> difference<00:03:09.010> between<00:03:09.069> ragout<00:03:09.610> and

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
so the difference between ragout and

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.149 
so the difference between ragout and
bolognese<00:03:10.480> they<00:03:10.720> say<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.799> addition

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
bolognese they say is the the addition

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.460 
bolognese they say is the the addition
of<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.400> chopped<00:03:12.579> tomatoes<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.569> ragu<00:03:14.110> would

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
of the chopped tomatoes so ragu would

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.319 
of the chopped tomatoes so ragu would
just<00:03:14.680> have<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.129> tomato<00:03:15.459> puree<00:03:15.939> and<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.239> would

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
just have the tomato puree and it would

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.420 
just have the tomato puree and it would
be<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> denser<00:03:16.930> thicker<00:03:16.959> sauce<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.920> more<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.400> a

Bolognese<00:03:21.069> with<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.549> chopped<00:03:21.730> tomatoes<00:03:21.760> it

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
very busy and you don't have time to let

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.949 
very busy and you don't have time to let
it<00:03:47.560> go<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> we<00:03:48.970> need<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.209> add<00:03:49.329> some<00:03:49.540> water<00:03:49.659> now

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959

it go so we need to add some water now
you<00:03:50.019> can<00:03:50.170> also<00:03:50.319> add<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.950> stop<00:03:51.159> that<00:03:51.940> beef

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
you can also add and stop that beef

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.699 
you can also add and stop that beef

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
stock you if you like you to give a bit

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.039 
stock you if you like you to give a bit
of<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.920> richer<00:03:54.069> flavor<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:55.150> I'm<00:03:55.810> going<00:03:55.989> to

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
of a richer flavor to it so I'm going to

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.920 
of a richer flavor to it so I'm going to
just<00:03:56.319> fill<00:03:56.709> my<00:03:56.920> tin<00:03:57.159> with<00:03:57.519> water<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.359> others<00:03:58.659> I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
just fill my tin with water and others I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.800 
just fill my tin with water and others I
know<00:03:59.409> some<00:03:59.769> children<00:04:00.189> don't<00:04:00.370> like<00:04:00.810> chopped

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
know some children don't like chopped

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.479 
know some children don't like chopped
tomatoes<00:04:02.349> so<00:04:02.560> what<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:02.980> could<00:04:03.099> actually<00:04:03.250> do

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
tomatoes so what you could actually do

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.550 
tomatoes so what you could actually do
is<00:04:03.700> just<00:04:04.000> bits<00:04:04.540> them<00:04:04.780> with<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.019> hand<00:04:05.200> blender

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
is just bits them with the hand blender

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.440 
is just bits them with the hand blender
as<00:04:05.709> well<00:04:05.739> if<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.129> first<00:04:06.549> smoother<00:04:06.939> sauce<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
as well if you first smoother sauce and

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.569 
as well if you first smoother sauce and
just<00:04:07.840> add<00:04:08.019> it<00:04:08.139> that<00:04:08.290> way<00:04:08.439> so<00:04:08.889> bring<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.310> to

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
just add it that way so bring that to

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.640 
just add it that way so bring that to
the<00:04:09.670> boil<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:10.120> once<00:04:10.689> it's<00:04:10.930> at<00:04:11.019> boiling<00:04:11.379> points

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
the boil and once it's at boiling points

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.379 
the boil and once it's at boiling points
just<00:04:11.829> bring<00:04:12.069> time<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.430> really<00:04:12.730> gently<00:04:13.150> simmer

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
just bring time to really gently simmer

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.119 
just bring time to really gently simmer
probably<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.049> lowest<00:04:14.230> string<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.829> you<00:04:14.949> have

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
probably the lowest string that you have

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.819 
probably the lowest string that you have
on<00:04:15.310> your<00:04:15.400> cooker<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.000> as<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:17.019> said<00:04:17.229> if<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.620> can

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
on your cooker and as I said if you can

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.319 
on your cooker and as I said if you can
try<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.070> even<00:04:18.310> cook<00:04:18.549> for<00:04:18.729> at<00:04:18.789> least<00:04:18.970> an<00:04:19.209> hour

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
try and even cook for at least an hour

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.060 
try and even cook for at least an hour
and<00:04:19.389> a<00:04:19.449> half<00:04:19.630> if<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.260> have<00:04:20.380> more<00:04:20.560> time<00:04:20.739> two

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
and a half if you have more time two

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.890 
and a half if you have more time two
hours<00:04:21.099> two<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.639> half<00:04:21.789> hours<00:04:22.150> brilliance<00:04:22.660> and

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
hours two and half hours brilliance and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.020 
hours two and half hours brilliance and
you'll<00:04:23.620> find<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:24.070> will<00:04:24.190> probably<00:04:24.370> will<00:04:24.820> dry

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
you'll find it will probably will dry

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.520 
you'll find it will probably will dry
out<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.510> look<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> longer<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.409> do

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
out and it look the longer that you do

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.980 
out and it look the longer that you do
cook<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.430> do<00:04:27.760> little<00:04:28.060> bit<00:04:28.150> water<00:04:28.419> or<00:04:28.810> more

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
cook it so I do little bit water or more

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.240 
cook it so I do little bit water or more
stock<00:04:29.289> whichever<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.919> prefer

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
stock whichever you prefer

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.490 
stock whichever you prefer
and<00:04:30.610> obviously<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.810> longer<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.139> cook<00:04:32.320> it

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
and obviously the longer you cook it

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.219 
and obviously the longer you cook it
look<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.130> more<00:04:33.250> intense<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.789> flavor<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:34.570> it's

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
look the more intense the flavor so it's

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.529 
look the more intense the flavor so it's
better<00:04:35.409> for<00:04:35.560> all<00:04:35.740> okay<00:04:36.370> so<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.789> would<00:04:37.000> want<00:04:37.389> it

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
better for all okay so I would want it

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.480 
better for all okay so I would want it
simmering<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.169> would<00:04:38.470> put<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> lid<00:04:38.860> over<00:04:38.889> it<00:04:39.220> just

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
simmering I would put a lid over it just

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.909 
simmering I would put a lid over it just
to<00:04:39.580> keep<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.849> moisture<00:04:40.240> inside<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.570> set<00:04:43.919> and

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.830 
to keep the moisture inside a set and
just<00:04:45.099> leave<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.280> couple<00:04:45.610> way<00:04:45.729> for<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.000> while
