00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.639
 and I was happy and very happy 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.410
 Welcome to a new edition of the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 esmad thousand of the week my name is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.699
 patrick and these are news more 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.630
 relevant published last week and 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 remember that the links of this news 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 You can find it below in the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 description one of the videos searches 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.559
 more freaks commented on last month is 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 no doubt anaconda to eliminate and if all 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.350
 we know that this time is spent 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.350
 tremendous but a tremendous 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.720
 I want to make a music video of a 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.940
 song that has practically no 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.500
 no sense and I want this video who 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.270
 have an 80 percent back 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.360
 rear without further back is called because 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.360
 on a finger simply port player is 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.510
 just beautiful are 4 minutes of 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.190
 pure butt without any sense comes 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.379
 even the videos of send have more 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.000
 I sense that and there's a lot of back 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.860
 to do with this video is that the them 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.110
 reports an egg and moved to the background 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.600
 because while I watch the video in my 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.610
 mind in another area letter 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.160
 Colo Colo Colo Colo Colo Colo Colo Colo 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.720
 colo colo colo floats but you 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.460
 you know how the internet is responsible 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.530
 to beautify everything that is really 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.390
 ridiculous that there is on the internet so 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 let's see how it sounds in this video well 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.730
 we changed the song for a song 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.220
 full of p2p 2 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.240
 [Music] 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.950
 but I told them that this would be beautiful 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.130
 even that we can find green the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.100
 fart in English is silent but deadly 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.780
 When he farted he played, nobody said 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.470
 there are many others all together in one 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 beautiful video clip and if you want to see this 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.720
 video you know how to do it by clicking 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.190
 Here below in the description of ascentis 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 up to modern times height 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.570
 more than a trend they are already 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.320
 practically a disease 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.090
 [Music] 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.560
 when growing this precise moment while 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.030
 you take another picture making 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.920
 caritas to the camera in this happens to you 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.870
 the mind the ridiculous that you could look 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.740
 unless someone serious and up to 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.740
 internet and that be 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:24.520
 with people around I even care 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.520
 imagine the ridiculous 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.080
 so the mention in rose this father 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.210
 who left this record for science 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.710
 so we can all see how ridiculous 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.710
 we could look while we got out 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.480
 but good if you have a friend 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.959
 with a strange addiction to 66 records the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.959
 sample 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.750
 with a few happy moments we all 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.850
 others love many risks 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.340
 especially from your feet because we are 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.050
 we love them and we really enjoy 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.050
 of the integration pages 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.230
 because all the things that for nothing of the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.230
 world 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.140
 but we also laugh that a lot of 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.970
 these situations happen to us 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.500
 as for example who has not played 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:31.610
 this game that I do not even remember how it 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:34.660
 calls and we get into what is not 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.660
 normal is falling on your head 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.450
 but good if you want to enjoy these 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.870
 Peas must do it here below in the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.870

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.739
