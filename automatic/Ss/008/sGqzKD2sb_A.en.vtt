an extra carabiner to the sling and I
removed<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.440> looks<00:01:52.590> like

I cool the long line on top to tighten
this<00:02:21.030> connection<00:02:23.120> like<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:29.610> where<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
this connection like this is where I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.229 
this connection like this is where I
continue<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.870> make<00:02:31.290> sure<00:02:31.320> my<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:32.040> frames<00:02:32.459> are

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
continue and make sure my a frames are

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.740 
continue and make sure my a frames are
in<00:02:33.360> place<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.130> these<00:02:35.370> stood<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.680> I

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750

I've<00:02:50.730> actually<00:02:51.180> added<00:02:51.989> rolled<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.189> thoughts

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
I've actually added rolled of thoughts

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.130 
I've actually added rolled of thoughts
to<00:02:55.500> protect<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.549> line<00:02:59.360> then<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.480> straighten<00:03:01.019> my
