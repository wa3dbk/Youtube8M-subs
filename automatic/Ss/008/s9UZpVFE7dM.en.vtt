00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 dvd creative check the trailer 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.710
 and indeed to a German comedy and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.980
 With that we take a look at without 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.980
 grace 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.940
 finally, the election has managed the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.770
 roll the snails fundamentally 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.600
 change our extractor spell the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.600
 wallonie girls now animal on the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.490
 then continue 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.129
 finally, the girls have equal opportunities 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.129
 on the labor market 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.910
 and now the man is quoted 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.910
 we want a collage 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.450
 but also take longer 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.660
 the right of way road 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 11 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.420
 on 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.860
 they can go now 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.860
 can 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.200
 Sadly, your train still says your train 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.200
 50,000 times they are there 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.960
 we need the video tapes photos 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.960
 negative 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.430
 his 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.020
 you owe me something I will help you 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 Yes 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.039
 for example 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 similar women what do they imagine? 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:14.160
 great group I think that is one of the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.320
 worst trailer I have so far 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.670
 I saw him without mercy 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.600
 story tells of pippi and bee 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.550
 two sisters and their mother 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.620
 want to grab financially under the arms 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.660
 and for that the machos around her 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.460
 otherwise they only exploit dredging 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.900
 But they do not want to be able to do this 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.670
 definitely liked 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.050
 eventually collapsed and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.700
 Start one has on these two 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.630
 sisters yes that's the story of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.760
 without mercy 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.170
 that does not seem so exciting 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.160
 to be hammer but the trailer wants 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.990
 communicate us that we are 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.760
 just crazy is just that I'm at 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.560
 This trailer does not have to laugh 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.640
 I think the sound is incredibly bad 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 mixed so I only half 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 from the spoken ultimately 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.310
 understand and this sequence of 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.290
 fast cut 10 and a lot 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.180
 slapstick is just so oldschool though 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.920
 not cool going on and just old and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.570
 boring and that is a great pity 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.100
 because here we are quite a few well-known 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.880
 People like you in the coach 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.070
 tailor we have 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.800
 rolf zacher jan fedder gedeon burkhardt 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.750
 tonga tom beck ralf judge anna 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.459
 BÃ¶ttcher and many more you have here 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.300
 tries a little prominently in the movie 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.820
 to bring in 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.170
 the worse to watch like that 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.459
 Maybe I'm here on top of it 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.930
 also completely alone with this opinion 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.550
 but this is what I'm curious what 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.070
 you have to say in the comments to be 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.690
 to this trailer without mercy and whether you 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.489
 you watch the film chose natra film 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.110
 brings from this namely from the 2 may 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.580
 I'm going to go to German theaters 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.780
 Certainly alone look after you 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.850
 Do not you agree? 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.739
 it is worth the big advantage 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.150
 always when a trader does not work so well 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.350
 then you can at least still easily here 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.880
 in the cinema surprised because the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.380
 Expectations are so low 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.270
 pity, by the way, as a small 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.850
 conclusion word that we German so 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.580
 often need to make dramas or comedies 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.290
 Almost 99 of our films are always 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.000
 Dramas with love stories or 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.950
 The historical ones give the second 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.540
 world war of the nazis the ddr and the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.120
 the state or the same 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.450
 Look out for the twelve comedies 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.680
 just very much 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.540
 pity are alright I'm curious 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.340
 what original ultimately has to offer 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.959
 and especially your opinion on that 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.849
 trailer please write in the comments 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.680
 otherwise tomorrow at 15 o'clock at the latest 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.150
 new video and until then I hope you 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.620
 be back tomorrow, of course 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.620
 to wear
