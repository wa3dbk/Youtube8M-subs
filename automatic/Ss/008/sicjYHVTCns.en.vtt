00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.940
 let's say that of a sector like this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.129
 competitive like the one for another reason 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.159
 some becomes essential for a home 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.140
 he knows he wants to excel not to cure 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.370
 only the appearance of the product ie 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.649
 made the beautiful machines but look 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.839
 also take special care of everything 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.440
 the aspect concerning satisfaction 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.280
 of the customer 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.830
 in this context we naturally go 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.020
 to look at how the is managed 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.929
 customer for example not the showroom 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.780
 when the car is everything else but 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.940
 especially what happens once that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.300
 customer bought his car e 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.840
 then accompany him who has 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.810
 detected so we say the importer from 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.270
 little more than two years he tried then 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.299
 to invest in this sector 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.950
 building training center that 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:42.070
 these we are today precisely because of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.280
 put to the level with respect to all 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.520
 other subsidiaries across the world 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.329
 the technicians who work in the network 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.840
 Italian 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.200
 the technicians come to us to acquire 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.030
 precisely those skills that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.649
 guarantee to be able to carry out the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.640
 repair in a workmanlike manner 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.470
 we therefore have three classrooms together 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 theoretical but first with 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.780
 we are used at this time 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.600
 with a series of advanced infrastructures 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.730
 telematic leader then the smart boards 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.570
 delivered in interaction between the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.850
 contents present on our portal e 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.740
 or those that we are explicit 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 in the classroom after which we move 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.240
 then the second part of the course 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.490
 in the workshop next to these at this 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.940
 building where we invested instead 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.590
 two classrooms two workshops similar to that one 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.700
 that we find in ours 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.520
 dealers therefore with a 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.070
 attitude so as to try 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.800
 indeed singular failures that 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.950
 can on the cars 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.450
 so the technician coming back should be 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.170
 able to have learned that those 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.470
 useful for him returning to his place 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.470
 of work 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.569
 to explain to our technicians but also 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.130
 to our dealers then it can be 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.260
 we say the importance or the plus that 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.050
 of all-wheel drive 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.450
 we have also built a path on 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.450
 which one actually goes to 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.060
 readings and see how you need to 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.010
 use the means to draw the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.010
 maximum independent efficiency 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.739
 I'm pretty complicated in ours 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.110
 training center 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.780
 then we succeeded thanks to gods 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.040
 solar panels installed on the roof a 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.140
 cover let's say 60 60 70 percent 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.730
 energy needs here since 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.890
 we have installed from the balusters in 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.440
 four settlers at 20 kilowatts he sees 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.220
 which is perhaps an important one in terms of 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.860
 power 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.180
 starting from the question of needs 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.340
 energy with solar panels in 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.150
 meaning that kia italia wants to give, let's say 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.600
 so all this talk is to do 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.630
 understand the importance of the green footprint 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.250
 on the whole we say so 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.660
 the processes we go to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.150
 implement within his own 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.360
 company gradually we will therefore go to 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.960
 introduce hybrid cars first 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.860
 then a fuel coupling 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.950
 conventional with a heat engine with 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.970
 an electric motor so that the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.210
 customer 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.250
 may gradually enter that 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.980
 optics that is to use google 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.950
 is increasingly eco-friendly with 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.640
 the first environment and we all share 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.640
 How many 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.639
 the recharge for our soul here 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.210
 electric you can 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.029
 let's say so divided into two modes 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.919
 the slow one with alternating current which 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:08.479
 can also be done at home with the 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.270
 special form that we have 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.919
 indications to the car of this giving itself 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.560
 all that going to recharge the 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.349
 car with still back exactly 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.629
 therefore power rather reduced and in 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:27.439
 this case we talk about 12 about 12 hours 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:31.789
 however if you want to load it goes from 0 to 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:35.529
 100 percent while the fast one uses 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:38.330
 continuous current through a column 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.669
 special that can go 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.639
 20 kg guard up to a maximum of 100 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:48.530
 kilowatts and in this case we will go to 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:53.500
 recharge the car from 0 to 90 4 per 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:56.210
 one hundred in about two hours one time 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.629
 slow charging at home then how 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.590
 limited power at a very low cost 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.009
 content 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.949
 more or less one euro will be spoken each 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.139
 100 km so if one among a full for 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.300
 travel the 200 km that come from 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.229
 very much if the car will cost 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.710
 certainly less than 2 euros while 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.280
 for fast and clear charging that the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.180
 cost 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.500
 energy cannot be resold 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.629
 in Italy 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.069
 the course is more than anything else related 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.069
 amortization of the column
