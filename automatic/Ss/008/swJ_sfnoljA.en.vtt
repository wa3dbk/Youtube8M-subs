torque<00:00:41.020> sensor<00:00:41.440> which<00:00:42.130> allows<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:44.020> motor<00:00:44.350> to

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
torque sensor which allows the motor to

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.850 
torque sensor which allows the motor to
kick<00:00:44.920> in<00:00:45.220> with<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.930> reading<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.410> amount<00:00:47.770> of

pressure you apply to your pedal giving
it<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.620> really<00:00:50.860> smooth<00:00:51.309> response<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.380> working

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
it a really smooth response and working

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.190
