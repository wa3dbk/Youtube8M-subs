those ends now working on the back
section<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.030> don't<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> eyes<00:01:39.570> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
section because we don't have eyes in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.569 
section because we don't have eyes in
the<00:01:39.810> back<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.170> our<00:01:40.259> head<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.369> actually

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the back of our head I like to actually

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.030 
the back of our head I like to actually
go<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.509> fingers<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:42.960> feel<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
go in with my fingers and feel the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
go in with my fingers and feel the
actual<00:01:44.490> texture<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> hair<00:01:45.869> strand<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actual texture of that hair strand to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590 
actual texture of that hair strand to
make<00:01:46.560> sure<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.340> no<00:01:47.579> frizz<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.060> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
make sure that there is no frizz and all

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.929 
make sure that there is no frizz and all
of<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.899> moisture<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.500> completely<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
of that moisture is completely out of it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
of that moisture is completely out of it
so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.540> also<00:01:51.750> move<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.530> section<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so I also move that section out of the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.670 
so I also move that section out of the
way<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.899> any<00:01:55.110> wet<00:01:55.409> hair

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
way that way we don't have any wet hair

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
way that way we don't have any wet hair
lying<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> section<00:01:57.060> getting<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.840> hair

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
lying on that section getting that hair

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.280 
lying on that section getting that hair
damp<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.100> clean<00:01:59.670> sections<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.750> probably

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
damp so clean sections is also probably

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
damp so clean sections is also probably
the<00:02:01.439> best<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.790> by

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the best way that you can go about by

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
the best way that you can go about by
doing<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.329> blow-dry<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.259> gonna<00:02:04.439> help<00:02:04.710> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
doing your blow-dry it's gonna help you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
doing your blow-dry it's gonna help you
identify<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.640> each<00:02:05.909> hair<00:02:06.149> strand<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.630> nice<00:02:06.840> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
identify if each hair strand is nice and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
identify if each hair strand is nice and
dry<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.160> move<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.789> next

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
dry so that you can move on to that next

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.770 
dry so that you can move on to that next
step

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
step

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.440 
step
and<00:02:10.009> again<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.610> repetitive<00:02:11.970> move

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and again it's really a repetitive move

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.210 
and again it's really a repetitive move
it's<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.560> stretching<00:02:14.099> out

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
it's going in there and stretching out

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.039 
it's going in there and stretching out
those<00:02:14.459> strands<00:02:14.970> from<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.269> roots<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> ends

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
those strands from the roots to the ends

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.160 
those strands from the roots to the ends
and<00:02:16.319> concentrating<00:02:17.159> on<00:02:17.340> those<00:02:17.640> polished<00:02:18.629> ends

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and concentrating on those polished ends

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.559 
and concentrating on those polished ends
and<00:02:19.319> making<00:02:19.650> sure<00:02:19.829> that<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.220> drier<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.549> is<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
and making sure that the drier it is the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.270 
and making sure that the drier it is the
more<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.959> consistent<00:02:22.650> polished<00:02:23.069> look

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
more of a consistent polished look

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.619 
more of a consistent polished look
you're<00:02:23.430> gonna<00:02:23.519> be<00:02:23.610> getting<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.239> those<00:02:24.390> ends

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
you're gonna be getting on those ends

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.410 
you're gonna be getting on those ends
and<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.470> always<00:02:25.739> like<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.099> go<00:02:26.370> over<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.000> section

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
and I always like to go over the section

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.390 
and I always like to go over the section
just<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.870> make<00:02:28.079> sure<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.530> am<00:02:28.769> getting<00:02:29.069> that

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
just to make sure that I am getting that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.180 
just to make sure that I am getting that
nice<00:02:29.670> stretch<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.510> look<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.650> hair<00:02:31.950> but

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
nice stretch out look in that hair but

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.160 
nice stretch out look in that hair but
still<00:02:32.459> creating<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.090> volume<00:02:33.329> by<00:02:33.780> going

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
still creating that volume by going

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.380 
still creating that volume by going
under<00:02:34.829> that<00:02:34.860> section<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.609> making<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.090> round

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
under that section and making that round

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
under that section and making that round
brush<00:02:36.690> work<00:02:37.079> it's<00:02:37.290> talent<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:37.920> doing<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
brush work it's talent and doing that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.610 
brush work it's talent and doing that
bottom<00:02:38.790> section<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.319> see<00:02:40.500> I'm

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
bottom section as you can see I'm

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.470 
bottom section as you can see I'm
working<00:02:40.769> going<00:02:41.250> back<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.609> that<00:02:41.730> back<00:02:42.000> end<00:02:42.299> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
working going back to that back end and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.910 
working going back to that back end and
I<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.959> always<00:02:43.349> double<00:02:43.500> check<00:02:43.890> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
I like to always double check that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.009 
I like to always double check that
middle<00:02:44.489> section<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.510> reason<00:02:45.840> why<00:02:45.959> is

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
middle section and the reason why is

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.780 
middle section and the reason why is
because<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.470> could<00:02:46.680> get<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:46.920> little<00:02:47.250> tricky<00:02:47.670> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
because it could get a little tricky and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.339 
because it could get a little tricky and
it<00:02:47.909> could<00:02:48.060> make<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.389> believe<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.139> dry

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
it could make you believe that it's dry

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.660 
it could make you believe that it's dry
because<00:02:49.530> you're<00:02:49.799> not<00:02:49.889> seeing<00:02:50.220> it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
because you're not seeing it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.460 
because you're not seeing it
so<00:02:50.970> Obi's<00:02:51.359> going<00:02:51.599> back<00:02:51.810> there<00:02:52.079> and<00:02:52.170> kind<00:02:52.379> of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so Obi's going back there and kind of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.349 
so Obi's going back there and kind of
combining<00:02:52.920> those<00:02:53.190> two<00:02:53.459> sections<00:02:53.790> since<00:02:54.239> you

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
combining those two sections since you

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.509 
combining those two sections since you
just<00:02:54.629> separated<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.409> going<00:02:55.920> back<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.340> there

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
just separated them going back in there

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.129 
just separated them going back in there
and<00:02:56.609> combining<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.239> middle<00:02:57.540> section<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.079> you

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
and combining that middle section so you

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.199 
and combining that middle section so you
don't<00:02:58.379> have<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> line<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.099> demarcation<00:02:59.220> it's

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
don't have a line of demarcation it's

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.330 
don't have a line of demarcation it's
gonna<00:03:00.359> help<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.870> blow-dry<00:03:01.409> get<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.799> volume

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
gonna help that blow-dry get that volume

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.160 
gonna help that blow-dry get that volume
look<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.849> absolutely<00:03:03.180> need<00:03:03.599> throughout

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.410 
like to do it first but I'd rather go
back<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.190> re<00:03:11.340> wet<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.879> make<00:03:12.060> sure<00:03:12.090> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
back and re wet it and make sure that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.140 
back and re wet it and make sure that
that<00:03:12.599> section<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.139> completely<00:03:13.919> dry<00:03:14.280> when<00:03:15.000> I'm

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
that section is completely dry when I'm

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.960 
that section is completely dry when I'm
working<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.870> my<00:03:16.530> last<00:03:16.799> couple<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.430> sections

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
working on my last couple of sections

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.879 
working on my last couple of sections
now<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.750> middle<00:03:19.109> section<00:03:19.319> could<00:03:19.680> be<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
now that middle section could be a

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.559 
now that middle section could be a
little<00:03:20.129> tricky<00:03:20.519> because<00:03:20.669> you<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.359> some

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
little tricky because you can get some

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.020 
little tricky because you can get some
lines<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.989> demarcation<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.699> to<00:03:23.730> over

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
lines of demarcation so I like to over

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.909 
lines of demarcation so I like to over
direct<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.810> hair<00:03:25.049> either<00:03:25.290> forward<00:03:25.889> or

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
direct the hair either forward or

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.309 
direct the hair either forward or
backward<00:03:26.129> and<00:03:26.849> sometimes<00:03:27.449> I<00:03:27.599> do<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.840> both<00:03:28.079> ways

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
backward and sometimes I do it both ways

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.220 
backward and sometimes I do it both ways
that<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.769> can<00:03:28.980> actually<00:03:29.400> live<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.150> lie<00:03:30.840> in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
that way can actually live and lie in

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.379 
that way can actually live and lie in
that<00:03:31.440> living<00:03:31.769> position<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.639> does<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.090> its

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
that living position that it does on its

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.369 
that living position that it does on its
normal<00:03:33.840> own<00:03:34.669> now<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.780> brush<00:03:36.959> going

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
normal own now I do the brush going

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.050 
normal own now I do the brush going
forward<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.250> reason<00:03:38.549> why<00:03:38.639> is<00:03:38.699> because<00:03:38.940> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
forward and the reason why is because I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.330 
forward and the reason why is because I
like<00:03:39.329> up<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.629> sweep<00:03:39.930> ease<00:03:40.169> look<00:03:40.440> but<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> don't

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
like up a sweep ease look but I don't

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.309 
like up a sweep ease look but I don't
want<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.760> look<00:03:41.910> too<00:03:41.970> uniform<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.169> can

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
want it to look too uniform that it can

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.379 
want it to look too uniform that it can
only<00:03:43.500> stay<00:03:43.919> on<00:03:44.040> one<00:03:44.370> side<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.699> the<00:03:44.970> head

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
only stay on one side of the head

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.750 
only stay on one side of the head
so<00:03:45.750> moving<00:03:46.049> my<00:03:46.349> brush<00:03:46.709> from<00:03:47.040> one<00:03:47.280> side<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.579> the
