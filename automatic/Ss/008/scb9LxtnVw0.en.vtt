00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and a half or more and I was really

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.840 
and a half or more and I was really
trying<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> figure<00:00:49.680> out<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> could<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
trying to figure out how I could do that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.540 
trying to figure out how I could do that
with<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.510> big<00:00:52.230> heavy<00:00:52.350> camera<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
with this big heavy camera and and I and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
with this big heavy camera and and I and
I<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:54.120> did<00:00:54.480> shoot<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> full<00:00:55.590> rehearsal

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I actually did shoot a full rehearsal

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
I actually did shoot a full rehearsal
handheld<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:57.539> totally<00:00:58.410> wrecked<00:00:59.210> without

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
handheld and was totally wrecked without

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.020 
handheld and was totally wrecked without
it<00:01:00.239> yeah<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.579> concert<00:01:02.879> went

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it yeah so I think as the concert went

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
it yeah so I think as the concert went
on<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.300> operating<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.870> crappier<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.439> happier

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
on my operating got crappier and happier

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.390 
on my operating got crappier and happier
because<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.880> taking<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because what taking and you know and and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.060 
because what taking and you know and and
literally<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> next<00:01:09.150> day<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:10.799> was

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
literally the next day my my back was

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
literally the next day my my back was
sore<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.490> arms<00:01:11.520> were<00:01:11.850> sore<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.150> everything

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
sore my arms were sore like everything

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.469 
sore my arms were sore like everything
my<00:01:12.600> store<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.049> wasn't<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> wanted<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
my store it wasn't very so I wanted to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.649 
my store it wasn't very so I wanted to
come<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> better<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.599 

and<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.320> idea<00:01:21.409> was<00:01:21.560> not<00:01:21.859> so<00:01:22.039> much<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.369> float

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
and the idea was not so much to float

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.980 
and the idea was not so much to float
the<00:01:22.729> camera<00:01:22.939> out<00:01:22.969> in<00:01:23.149> front<00:01:23.299> of<00:01:23.420> me<00:01:23.569> but<00:01:23.840> to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
the camera out in front of me but to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.260 
the camera out in front of me but to
like<00:01:24.170> take<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:25.100> majority<00:01:25.579> of<00:01:25.609> that<00:01:25.759> 30<00:01:25.969> pound

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
like take the majority of that 30 pound

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.940 
like take the majority of that 30 pound
sort<00:01:26.569> of<00:01:26.630> off<00:01:26.780> my<00:01:26.990> shoulder<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.499> put<00:01:27.649> it<00:01:27.740> into

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
sort of off my shoulder and put it into

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.779 
sort of off my shoulder and put it into
my<00:01:28.189> hips<00:01:28.450> on<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.719> through<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.289> belt

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
my hips on to that through that belt

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.279 
my hips on to that through that belt
which<00:01:31.789> is<00:01:31.939> just<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.390> much<00:01:32.600> more<00:01:32.810> comfortable

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
which is just a much more comfortable

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.499 
which is just a much more comfortable
place<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:33.770> for<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.490> weight<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.939> rest<00:01:35.179> it's

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
place for for that weight to rest it's

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.929 
place for for that weight to rest it's
sort<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:36.039> going<00:01:37.039> on<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.369> center<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.700> your<00:01:37.759> body

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.099 
the concert would just used that I could
have<00:01:48.020> shot<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:48.560> another<00:01:48.740> hour<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:50.390> know<00:01:50.509> was

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
have shot for another hour you know was

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.800 
have shot for another hour you know was
no<00:01:51.530> real<00:01:51.740> muscle<00:01:51.979> strain<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.640> took<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.659> like

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
no real muscle strain it took this like

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.389 
no real muscle strain it took this like
pound<00:01:54.319> camera<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.709> probably<00:01:55.009> turn<00:01:55.189> it<00:01:55.310> into

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
pound camera and probably turn it into

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.119 
pound camera and probably turn it into
like<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.929> six<00:01:56.929> or<00:01:57.049> seven<00:01:57.289> pound<00:01:57.500> camera<00:01:57.979> of

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:58.129 
like a six or seven pound camera of

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.309 
like a six or seven pound camera of
Dibley<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.509> was<00:01:59.629> just<00:01:59.659> really<00:02:00.020> easy<00:02:00.200> to

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
Dibley so it was just really easy to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.850 
Dibley so it was just really easy to
stay<00:02:00.560> relaxed<00:02:01.129> and<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:02.379> stay<00:02:03.379> comfortable

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
stay relaxed and to stay comfortable

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.859 
stay relaxed and to stay comfortable
through<00:02:04.129> the<00:02:04.219> whole<00:02:04.369> shoot<00:02:04.640> good<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.450> comfort

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
through the whole shoot good the comfort

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.949 
through the whole shoot good the comfort
level<00:02:06.049> was<00:02:06.409> uh<00:02:06.849> was<00:02:07.849> was<00:02:08.299> good<00:02:08.509> i<00:02:08.539> wasn't<00:02:08.929> sure

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
level was uh was was good i wasn't sure

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.509 
level was uh was was good i wasn't sure
how<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.619> one<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:09.829> those<00:02:09.890> things<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.250> can

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
how it is one of those things you can

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.539 
how it is one of those things you can
think<00:02:10.729> about<00:02:11.299> it<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:13.400> wasn't

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
think about it and and I really wasn't

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.550 
think about it and and I really wasn't
sure<00:02:13.700> how<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.060> would<00:02:14.269> be<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.079> fact<00:02:15.290> it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
sure how it would be but but in fact it

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.069 
sure how it would be but but in fact it
it<00:02:15.859> was<00:02:16.430> very<00:02:16.640> comfortable<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.269> it's<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.930> my

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
it was very comfortable and it's just my

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.460 
it was very comfortable and it's just my
own<00:02:18.230> style<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:18.859> not<00:02:20.109> personally<00:02:21.109> just<00:02:21.140> so

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
own style I'm not personally just so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.640 
own style I'm not personally just so
interested<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.780> Steadicam<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:24.109> shots<00:02:24.470> I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
interested in a Steadicam like shots I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.800 
interested in a Steadicam like shots I
love<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:25.250> real<00:02:25.489> handheld<00:02:26.209> work<00:02:26.510> where<00:02:26.780> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
love like real handheld work where you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.479 
love like real handheld work where you
really<00:02:27.940> where<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> camera<00:02:30.040> moves<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.340> very

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
really where the camera moves in a very

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.640 
really where the camera moves in a very
human<00:02:31.700> way<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.299> where<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:33.019> adjust<00:02:33.349> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
human way and where you can adjust the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.259 
human way and where you can adjust the
frame<00:02:33.799> very<00:02:34.040> precisely<00:02:34.430> rather<00:02:35.150> than

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
frame very precisely rather than

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.199 
frame very precisely rather than
floating<00:02:35.630> through<00:02:35.959> space<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:38.060> me

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
floating through space and so I for me

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.819 
floating through space and so I for me
it's<00:02:38.389> I<00:02:38.720> think<00:02:38.780> most<00:02:39.049> effective<00:02:39.500> as<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.620> way<00:02:39.799> to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
it's I think most effective as a way to

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.710 
it's I think most effective as a way to
allow<00:02:40.130> me<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.370> get<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:40.700> handheld<00:02:41.150> touch<00:02:41.480> with

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
allow me to get that handheld touch with

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.620 
allow me to get that handheld touch with
a<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:43.400> know<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> bit<00:02:43.880> camera<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.450> would<00:02:44.510> be

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
a you know a bit camera that would be

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.930 
a you know a bit camera that would be
difficult<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.049> hand<00:02:45.290> hold<00:02:45.709> otherwise

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.060 

I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:51.990> certain<00:02:52.380> certainly<00:02:52.830> if<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
I think so certain certainly if the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.700 
I think so certain certainly if the
takes<00:02:53.340> our<00:02:53.720> long<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.990> if<00:02:55.050> there's<00:02:55.200> many<00:02:55.380> takes

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
takes our long or if there's many takes

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.790 
takes our long or if there's many takes
it<00:02:56.010> would<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.550> huge<00:02:56.850> aid<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:58.380> know<00:02:58.500> on

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
it would be it's a huge aid you know on

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.620 
it would be it's a huge aid you know on
a<00:02:58.860> big<00:02:59.520> product<00:02:59.790> usually<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.300> an<00:03:00.390> assistant

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
a big product usually have an assistant

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.330 
a big product usually have an assistant
and<00:03:00.960> if<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.140> tix<00:03:01.410> are<00:03:01.560> short<00:03:01.770> enough<00:03:01.830> if<00:03:02.190> it's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
and if the tix are short enough if it's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
and if the tix are short enough if it's
a<00:03:02.400> 30<00:03:02.610> second<00:03:02.970> take<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.810> off<00:03:03.990> on<00:03:04.020> off

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
a 30 second take it's just on off on off

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.710 
a 30 second take it's just on off on off
and<00:03:04.410> it's<00:03:04.830> not<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.130> bad<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:05.610> yeah<00:03:06.540> I'd<00:03:06.690> say

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and it's not so bad but yeah I'd say

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.300 
and it's not so bad but yeah I'd say
even<00:03:06.900> went<00:03:07.290> even<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.770> just<00:03:07.800> gets<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.280> be

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
even went even if it just gets to be

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
even went even if it just gets to be
three<00:03:08.880> or<00:03:09.000> four<00:03:09.150> or<00:03:09.240> five<00:03:09.390> minutes<00:03:09.750> it's

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
three or four or five minutes it's

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.040 
three or four or five minutes it's
helpful<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.400> would<00:03:12.300> also<00:03:12.510> think<00:03:12.750> at<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
helpful and I would also think at the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.410 
helpful and I would also think at the
end<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.470> or<00:03:14.100> as<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> day<00:03:14.550> goes<00:03:14.760> into<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> 10th

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
end of a or as a day goes into the 10th

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.500 
end of a or as a day goes into the 10th
or<00:03:15.630> 11th<00:03:15.960> hour<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.470> probably<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:18.240> would<00:03:18.330> be<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
or 11th hour you probably it would be a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.040 
or 11th hour you probably it would be a
big<00:03:18.720> aid<00:03:18.960> and<00:03:19.230> as<00:03:19.410> far<00:03:19.620> as<00:03:19.760> staying<00:03:20.760> fresh<00:03:21.120> when

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
big aid and as far as staying fresh when

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.360 
big aid and as far as staying fresh when
you're<00:03:22.170> making<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.470> concert<00:03:22.890> film<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.220> can

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
you're making a concert film you can

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.710 
you're making a concert film you can
either<00:03:23.550> ain't<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.270> either<00:03:24.420> try<00:03:24.690> to

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
either ain't you can either try to

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.080 
either ain't you can either try to
control<00:03:25.170> everything<00:03:25.860> which<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.640> hard<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.910> do

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
control everything which is hard to do

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.150 
control everything which is hard to do
in<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.360> real<00:03:27.390> venue<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> real<00:03:28.350> audience<00:03:28.620> and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
in a real venue with a real audience and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.000 
in a real venue with a real audience and
not<00:03:29.850> be<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.150> people's<00:03:30.420> away<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.960> or<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.830> can

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
not be in people's away and or you can

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.590 
not be in people's away and or you can
treat<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.610> documentary<00:03:32.880> which<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.480> how

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
treat it like a documentary which is how

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.020

particular<00:03:54.060> tool<00:03:54.540> let<00:03:55.470> me<00:03:55.620> do<00:03:55.770> on<00:03:56.070> this

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
particular tool let me do on this

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.490 
particular tool let me do on this
project<00:03:56.489> which<00:03:56.760> we've<00:03:56.910> been<00:03:57.030> really<00:03:57.500> very

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
project which we've been really very

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.199 
project which we've been really very
very<00:03:58.590> difficult<00:03:58.890> without<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.790> would<00:04:00.090> say

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
very difficult without it I would say

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.000 
very difficult without it I would say
the<00:04:00.360> majority<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.989> projects<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.440> work<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:01.770> do

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
the majority of projects I work on do

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.740 
the majority of projects I work on do
not<00:04:02.160> involve<00:04:02.459> me<00:04:02.670> hand<00:04:03.030> holding<00:04:03.239> camera<00:04:03.450> for

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
not involve me hand holding camera for

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.600 
not involve me hand holding camera for
hours<00:04:04.020> at<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.230> time<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:05.280> seemed<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:05.489> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
hours at a time so this seemed like the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.990 
hours at a time so this seemed like the
perfect<00:04:06.170> vehicle<00:04:07.170> for<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.770> um<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.459> know

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
perfect vehicle for this um you know

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.150 
perfect vehicle for this um you know
other<00:04:09.180> things<00:04:09.239> have<00:04:09.540> come<00:04:09.690> up<00:04:09.750> there<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.500> couple

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
other things have come up there a couple

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.090 
other things have come up there a couple
years<00:04:11.640> ago<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.880> shot<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> whole<00:04:12.650> feature<00:04:13.650> film

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
years ago I shot a whole feature film

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.280 
years ago I shot a whole feature film
for<00:04:14.280> like<00:04:14.370> 20<00:04:14.640> days<00:04:14.820> entirely<00:04:15.660> handheld<00:04:16.080> and

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
for like 20 days entirely handheld and

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.690 
for like 20 days entirely handheld and
this<00:04:17.040> would<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.250> been<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.370> really<00:04:17.520> great

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
this would have been a really great

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.659 
this would have been a really great
thing<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.000> him<00:04:18.239> have<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.020> didn't<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.669> of

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
thing to him have I didn't have it of

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.979 
thing to him have I didn't have it of
course<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:20.970> was<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.330> lighter<00:04:21.510> camera

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
course it was a little lighter camera

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.340 
course it was a little lighter camera
too<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:23.030> it's<00:04:24.030> using<00:04:24.150> an<00:04:24.360> hvx<00:04:24.780> but<00:04:24.960> with<00:04:25.080> one<00:04:25.260> of

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
too so it's using an hvx but with one of

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.900 
too so it's using an hvx but with one of
these<00:04:25.440> lens<00:04:25.710> adapter<00:04:26.160> system<00:04:26.460> so<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.669> still

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
these lens adapter system so it still

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.440 
these lens adapter system so it still
got<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.690> know<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.810> bit<00:04:28.140> much<00:04:28.910> if<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.090> did<00:04:30.330> it

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
got you know a bit much if I did it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.790 
got you know a bit much if I did it
