give Motorola the popularity that it had
years<00:02:01.290> ago<00:02:01.590> particularly<00:02:02.189> because<00:02:02.460> obviously

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
years ago particularly because obviously

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
years ago particularly because obviously
it<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.840> very<00:02:04.140> sad<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.770> these<00:02:04.920> companies

from major surprise at Aoife it's hard
to<00:03:13.150> see<00:03:13.359> if<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.659> is<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> rotating<00:03:14.560> bezel<00:03:14.799> or

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
to see if this is a rotating bezel or

to see if this is a rotating bezel or
not<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.790> does<00:03:16.030> lead<00:03:16.420> me<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.169> question

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
not but it does lead me to the question

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.509 
not but it does lead me to the question
of<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.530> day<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.919> was<00:03:18.010> actually<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.430> whole

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
of the day that was actually the whole

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.430 
of the day that was actually the whole
purpose<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.030> segment<00:03:19.329> what<00:03:20.290> do<00:03:20.380> you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
purpose of this segment what do you

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.589 
purpose of this segment what do you
think<00:03:20.650> about<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:21.010> watch<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.730> gear<00:03:22.060> as<00:03:22.269> to

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
think about this watch this gear as to

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.270 
think about this watch this gear as to
do<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.380> design<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.040> see<00:03:24.250> or

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
do you like the design that you see or

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.289 
do you like the design that you see or
not<00:03:24.700> because<00:03:25.569> in<00:03:25.720> my<00:03:25.900> case<00:03:26.230> no<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.220> looks<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.880> lot

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
not because in my case no it looks a lot
