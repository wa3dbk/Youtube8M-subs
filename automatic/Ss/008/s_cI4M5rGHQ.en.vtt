authors and we're going to talk about
template<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.939> gauge<00:00:30.599> today<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
template and gauge today they are I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950 
template and gauge today they are I
can't<00:00:32.640> wait<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> talk<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.270> gauge<00:00:33.570> very

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
can't wait to talk about gauge very

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.830 
can't wait to talk about gauge very
because<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.160> always<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.610> people<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:36.660> don't

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because I always think people they don't

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
because I always think people they don't
really<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.160> most

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really want to do it but it's the most

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430 
really want to do it but it's the most
important<00:00:39.059> thing<00:00:39.090> wouldn't<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> say<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
important thing wouldn't you say it is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.869 
important thing wouldn't you say it is
the<00:00:40.620> most<00:00:40.800> important<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:41.700> anyone

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the most important thing and when anyone

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.010 
the most important thing and when anyone
tells<00:00:42.149> me<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.390> they're<00:00:42.510> not<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
tells me that they're not going to do a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
tells me that they're not going to do a
gauge<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.100> simple<00:00:44.309> answer<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.969> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
gauge I have one simple answer if you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
gauge I have one simple answer if you
don't<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> gauge<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> what

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
don't do a gauge you get with it what

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.830 
don't do a gauge you get with it what
you<00:00:46.920> deserve<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> doesn't<00:00:47.910> fit<00:00:48.239> yeah<00:00:48.660> we

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you deserve when it doesn't fit yeah we

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
you deserve when it doesn't fit yeah we
can<00:00:48.989> almost<00:00:49.110> guarantee<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.010> won't<00:00:50.160> yes

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
can almost guarantee that it won't yes

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.549 
can almost guarantee that it won't yes
that<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.570> say<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.530> should

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that what we say is that you should

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.760 
that what we say is that you should
always<00:00:52.800> overdo<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.730> gauge<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.870> cast<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.530> more

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
always overdo your gauge so cast on more

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.619 
always overdo your gauge so cast on more
than<00:00:55.949> 20<00:00:56.160> stitches<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:57.059> whatever<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> pattern

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
than 20 stitches or whatever the pattern

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
than 20 stitches or whatever the pattern
says<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> says<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.649> gauge<00:00:58.800> should<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.039> 20

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
says if it says your gauge should be 20

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
says if it says your gauge should be 20
stitches<00:00:59.730> cast<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.149> 24<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> says<00:01:01.140> 30<00:01:01.440> 34

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
stitches cast on 24 if it says 30 34

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
stitches cast on 24 if it says 30 34
give<00:01:02.789> yourself<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> couple<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.600> extra<00:01:03.930> stitches

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
give yourself a couple of extra stitches

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.640 
give yourself a couple of extra stitches
so<00:01:04.830> we've<00:01:04.949> done<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.549> big<00:01:05.790> swatch<00:01:06.150> here

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
so we've done a really big swatch here

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.800 
so we've done a really big swatch here
just<00:01:07.650> watch<00:01:07.830> by<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.970> more<00:01:09.180> accurate

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
just watch by the way the more accurate

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
just watch by the way the more accurate
is<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.100> settled<00:01:11.549> into

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is going to be as you have settled into

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.960 
is going to be as you have settled into
your<00:01:12.030> rhythm<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.930> didn't<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
your rhythm I didn't know right and you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.429 
your rhythm I didn't know right and you
also<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> stay<00:01:15.600> away<00:01:15.780> from<00:01:15.810> measuring

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
also want to stay away from measuring

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
also want to stay away from measuring
your<00:01:16.560> edges<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.970> when<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.479> gauge<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
your edges so when you do your gauge you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.870 
your edges so when you do your gauge you
take<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.470> swatch<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.369> put<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.700> tape

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
take your swatch and you put your tape

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
take your swatch and you put your tape
measure<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> point<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
measure down and with the point of a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
measure down and with the point of a
needle<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.460> finger<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.270> start

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
needle or your finger you just start

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
needle or your finger you just start
counting<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.830> instance<00:01:26.070> we've<00:01:26.580> got

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
counting so in this instance we've got

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.810 
counting so in this instance we've got
exactly<00:01:27.090> four<00:01:27.540> stitches<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.259> edge<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.310> if

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
exactly four stitches to the edge and if

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.370 
exactly four stitches to the edge and if
you're<00:01:29.970> using<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.360> yarn<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.259> going

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you're using a yarn where you're going

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.499 
you're using a yarn where you're going
to<00:01:31.439> put<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.650> different<00:01:31.799> pattern<00:01:32.340> stitches<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
to put in different pattern stitches you

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.730 
to put in different pattern stitches you
can<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:33.960> happens<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> edge

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
can see what happens here the edge

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.310 
can see what happens here the edge
changes<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.180> pattern<00:01:36.570> stitches<00:01:36.990> come<00:01:37.170> in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
changes as the pattern stitches come in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
changes as the pattern stitches come in
so<00:01:37.799> always<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.579> swatch<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.540> pattern

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so always do your swatch in the pattern

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.450 
so always do your swatch in the pattern
stitch<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> use<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.400> we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
stitch that you're going to use and we

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
stitch that you're going to use and we
should<00:01:41.640> point<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:41.939> that's<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> same

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
should point out that's all the same

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.749 
should point out that's all the same
yarn<00:01:43.259> yes<00:01:43.649> different<00:01:44.009> colors<00:01:44.280> exactly

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
yarn yes different colors exactly

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.069 
yarn yes different colors exactly
different<00:01:45.060> colors<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.450> each<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
different pattern stitch to really see

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
different pattern stitch to really see
how<00:01:48.360> much<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> waver<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> wavers

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
how much it can waver and if it wavers

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.100 
how much it can waver and if it wavers

we've<00:02:28.610> set<00:02:28.909> it<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.269> such<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.510> way<00:02:29.720> that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
we've set it up in such a way that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.199 
we've set it up in such a way that
instead<00:02:30.049> of<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.319> one<00:02:30.709> wrap<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.220> wraps<00:02:31.579> three

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
instead of just one wrap it wraps three

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.940 
instead of just one wrap it wraps three
times<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.989> same<00:02:33.230> stitch<00:02:33.560> just
