00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.090
 and at the lab combination of and old wind 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.500
 and laboratories it's a laboratory of 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.960
 search for renault it's a 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.599
 prototype research that foreshadows 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.060
 ultra-sober cars of the future and lava 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.490
 it's a liter to a hundred a consumption 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.739
 record reached across three pillars 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.930
 techniques that are the relief the 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.660
 car and 400 kg lighter than a 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.280
 current equivalent car 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 the aerodynamics the car was designed 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 for well penetrated in the air 30% more 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.130
 effective than a current car and then 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.990
 it is also a traction chain 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.610
 a rechargeable hybrid engine 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.110
 which allows him to reach this 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.050
 record consumption is a car 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.940
 which can travel up to 160 kilometers 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.530
 time that has the ability to roll in 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.660
 pure electric up to sixty 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.200
 kilometers is a car that makes 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.650
 950 kg taking into account also its 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.390
 traction battery of 6.7 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.950
 kilowatt hour then beyond a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 research prototype 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.420
 it is not intended to be sold 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.280
 on the other hand the whole of the hundred 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.289
 of innovations that it federates for 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.509
 achieve these record performances she 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.429
 each of these innovations is meant to 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.499
 be applied gradually in the 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.149
 renault range on aerodynamics we're going 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.579
 find all kinds of features 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.770
 interesting for example noted here this is 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.270
 little shutter that we see here on 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.670
 call the flaps what come 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.069
 open like that above 70 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.139
 km / hour and who finally have for 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.759
 effect of channeling air and 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.369
 tighten the back wake which 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.389
 reduces the suction effect that holds the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.060
 high speed car 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:48.920
 we also have its hubcaps 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.959
 assets that are closed most of the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.939
 time because the air slides well on 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.709
 when the brakes are 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.450
 hot we need that the 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.399
 hubcaps opens to ventilate and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.359
 cool down the brakes and there is a 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.609
 system that has just opened 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.229
 automatically at the front of the vehicle one 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.909
 will find features 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.590
 aerodynamic very interesting in the 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.899
 front grille you notice here this is 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.620
 scoop these species of air net that we have 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.629
 called the curtains finally channels 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.950
 and therefore greatly reduce drag 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.409
 aerodynamic of the car 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.690
 another nice feature 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.659
 on the front under this grille we 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.420
 have a deployable blade that here is 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.190
 folded and which is above 70 km 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 hour ie at a speed where 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.340
 aerodynamics plays a role 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.409
 preponderant over the restraint of the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 car this blade well lower down to little 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.519
 close to that level and so it reduces 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.620
 the passage of air under the body is 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.629
 in fact it's a rule in cars on 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.150
 has every interest in passing on a maximum 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.400
 of air above the car and the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.750
 minimum possible below because the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.549
 under a car is always less 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.280
 aerodynamic we will find 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.440
 also 7 matic knots that are at once 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940
 much lighter less resistant to 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.750
 bearing progress 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.000
 note here these video cameras that have 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.989
 replaced mirrors 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.060
 traditional they have a surface 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.709
 frontal very reduced and so she 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.440
 also helps to improve 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.540
 penetration into the air of the car and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.510
 olap so this is all this combination 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.299
 technologies that contribute to its 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.590
 its record sobriety the innovations that 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.989
 will come first are those who 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.819
 have little impact on our way of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.319
 produce in our factories by cons 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.200
 some innovations of this car 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.569
 like magnesium or some composite 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.099
 will need to change the way 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.900
 we have to make the car 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.970
 these are important investments 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.099
 it also requires time 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.760
 some of his innovations 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.769
 will appear at the end of the decade 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.769
 even a little bit later for some
