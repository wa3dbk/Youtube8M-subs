00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
knees we're doing the bench press you're

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.410 
knees we're doing the bench press you're
working<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:19.140> shoulders<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.210> your

working your shoulders as well as your

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.860 
working your shoulders as well as your
elbows<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.210> multi-joint<00:01:24.210> exercise<00:01:24.660> is

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
elbows here so multi-joint exercise is

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.050 
elbows here so multi-joint exercise is
definitely<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.220> far<00:01:26.850> as

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
definitely the way that go as far as

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.440 
definitely the way that go as far as
building<00:01:28.040> building<00:01:29.040> muscle<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:30.300> I<00:01:30.390> said

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
building building muscle and like I said

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.000 
building building muscle and like I said
I'll<00:01:30.660> go<00:01:30.780> over<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> repetitions<00:01:31.560> once<00:01:31.710> again

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
I'll go over the repetitions once again

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.180 
I'll go over the repetitions once again
from<00:01:32.310> 8<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.640> 10<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.120> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.960> I'd<00:01:34.710> say<00:01:34.980> you<00:01:35.040> can

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
from 8 to 10 and you can I'd say you can

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.600 
from 8 to 10 and you can I'd say you can
probably<00:01:35.370> go<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.360> far<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.660> maybe<00:01:36.840> 75<00:01:37.610> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
probably go back as far as maybe 75 to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.540 
probably go back as far as maybe 75 to
maybe<00:01:39.420> 90<00:01:40.050> as<00:01:40.290> far<00:01:40.830> as<00:01:40.950> ringing<00:01:41.190> you're<00:01:41.280> really

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
maybe 90 as far as ringing you're really

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.770 
maybe 90 as far as ringing you're really
trying<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.120> some<00:01:42.330> muscle

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
trying to put on some muscle

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.640 
trying to put on some muscle
so<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.830> addressed<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.600> repetitions<00:01:45.650> we

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
so we addressed the repetitions we

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.950 
so we addressed the repetitions we
addressed<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> intensity<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.660> just<00:01:48.870> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
addressed the intensity and we just the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.930 
addressed the intensity and we just the
type<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> exercises<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.920> need<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.610> building

type of exercises you need for building

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.910 
type of exercises you need for building
muscle<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.260> add<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.680> little

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
muscle and I can also add a little

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
muscle and I can also add a little

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
with toning before I talked about let's

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
with toning before I talked about let's
talk<00:02:42.750> about<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.049> legs<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.440> example<00:02:43.470> before<00:02:44.250> I

mention the squatting or lunging using

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.420 
mention the squatting or lunging using
multi-joint<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.560> for<00:02:49.560> toning<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.099> can<00:02:50.250> get

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
multi-joint for a for toning you can get

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.280 
multi-joint for a for toning you can get
on<00:02:50.549> your<00:02:50.760> lake<00:02:51.150> press<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:51.900> get<00:02:52.109> on<00:02:52.170> your

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
on your lake press you can get on your

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to go higher reps higher reps so let's

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.770 
to go higher reps higher reps so let's
go<00:02:57.959> higher<00:02:58.200> reps<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.480> you<00:03:00.480> want<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.659> go<00:03:00.750> a

go higher reps and you want to go a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.210 
go higher reps and you want to go a
little<00:03:00.959> bit<00:03:01.140> lighter<00:03:01.379> that's<00:03:01.829> what<00:03:02.010> that's

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
little bit lighter that's what that's

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.280 
little bit lighter that's what that's
what's<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.579> enable<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:03.870> with

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
what's going to enable you to go with

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.960 
what's going to enable you to go with
the<00:03:04.379> higher<00:03:04.530> reps<00:03:04.859> so<00:03:05.400> let's<00:03:05.579> back<00:03:05.730> our

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the higher reps so let's back our

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.030 
the higher reps so let's back our
intensity<00:03:06.540> down<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.530> maybe<00:03:07.769> as<00:03:08.459> low<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:10.040> six

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
intensity down to maybe as low as a six

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.170 
intensity down to maybe as low as a six
seventy<00:03:11.609> 65%<00:03:12.599> might<00:03:13.560> even<00:03:13.739> go<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:14.010> low<00:03:14.190> as<00:03:14.220> 55%

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
seventy 65% might even go as low as 55%

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.659 
seventy 65% might even go as low as 55%
and<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.780> reps<00:03:16.019> can<00:03:16.230> go<00:03:16.379> anywhere<00:03:16.799> between<00:03:17.040> 15

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
and the reps can go anywhere between 15

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:22.099 
and the reps can go anywhere between 15
to<00:03:17.700> 20<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.980> that's<00:03:19.980> one<00:03:20.310> way<00:03:20.609> of<00:03:20.959> tawny

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
to 20 so that's one way of tawny
