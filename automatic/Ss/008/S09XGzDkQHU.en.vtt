00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.010 
I think this is probably some of the
coolest<00:03:48.560> packaging<00:03:49.220> i<00:03:49.430> have<00:03:49.550> ever<00:03:49.790> seen<00:03:50.180> as

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
coolest packaging i have ever seen as

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.260 
coolest packaging i have ever seen as
far<00:03:51.080> as<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> toy<00:03:51.740> in<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.160> display<00:03:52.490> that's<00:03:53.060> the

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
far as a toy in a display that's the

a very very good representation all the
way<00:05:58.970> around<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.419> thought<00:05:59.599> they<00:05:59.780> had<00:05:59.900> a<00:05:59.930> tail

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229

though but I could be wrong but any no

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.850 
though but I could be wrong but any no
I'm<00:06:02.659> sure<00:06:02.870> metella<00:06:03.320> would<00:06:03.470> have<00:06:03.560> gotten<00:06:03.710> it
