this<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.430> one<00:05:04.060> step<00:05:04.389> beyond<00:05:05.080> right<00:05:05.979> let's<00:05:06.550> see

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
this is one step beyond right let's see

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.469 
this is one step beyond right let's see
if<00:05:07.120> there<00:05:07.449> is<00:05:07.479> anything<00:05:08.050> else<00:05:08.229> on<00:05:08.440> assist<00:05:08.710> a
