 Hello everyone today, the video will be a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.890
 palm oil or rather this video is a double 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.400
 my recent pasta from instagram 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.710
 iherb has popular nut spreads 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.920
 including pound fruit oil 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.320
 she's an oil of oil palm like us 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.930
 know palm oil is not particularly useful 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 product and I completely agree with this but 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 here I ask for your attention and want 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 tell you about two types of palm 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.510
 palm oil is obtained from the fruit 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.149
 oil palm 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 one type of oil is made from the pulp 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 fruit and it is called pound fruit oil 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.010
 or pawn red coil depending on the degree 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 its processing and other kind of oil is also from 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.000
 palm trees but get it from the bones of the fruit 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.190
 and it is called full of kernel oil oil 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.110
 the pulp is red it is rich 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.230
 vitamins her carotenoids which in 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.289
 the body turns into vitamin a 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 responsible for our time is the immune system 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.159
 this oil contains mostly pol 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 barbed and oleic acid and in it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.570
 somewhere around 50 percent saturated fat 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 acid palm oil pawn fruit oil not 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.330
 contain trans fat but with butter 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.509
 pits all bad oil pits 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.450
 contains mainly lauri new acid 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.340
 saturated acids and in it from 80 to 90 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.170
 percent according to various data that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.150
 uniquely affects the level of bad 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.759
 cholesterol with excessive it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.259
 use let's draw conclusions 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.420
 together the first thing I would give you 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 recommended it to read the composition of any 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.630
 product very carefully if composed 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.299
 we see what is written 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 pawn fruit oil or plenipotentiary while the all 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.200
 relatively normal risk of dying from 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.420
 heart attack significantly reduced but 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.530
 abuse 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.350
 especially if you have high cholesterol 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.280
 have heart disease or 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.700
 overweight, I would not recommend 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.430
 although actively practicing people 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.890
 its principle is possible such a product 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.340
 include and even daily but it is already 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.440
 a matter of taste and a matter of your choice and second 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.170
 as we read carefully the composition and 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.690
 if we see what is written just palm 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.150
 oil here the manufacturer is clearly something we do not 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.480
 agrees and most often this is the most 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.019
 harmful cheap palm oil is possible 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.970
 it is even hydrogenated but there is also 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.060
 private producers who write 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.310
 punk girl will read composition be 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.319
 attentive to them all health I hope 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.480
