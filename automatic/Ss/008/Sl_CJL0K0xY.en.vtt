00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.280

 make oil extract and you have it 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.939
 was on the desk 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.030

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.520
 save and she will shift here 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.920
 okay so here you are now 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 open h xd so this is software 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.100
 hexadecimal with that one can do 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.360
 a lot of things so it's 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.610
 totally free you can 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 download without any problem so 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.299
 you open h xd you take your 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.740
 backup and you slide it in 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.540
 ok so we're going to open it up so here 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.250
 where you have the little box 16 you 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.200
 can you put in 32 it will be more 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 comfortable to watch so 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.000
 Now you make the long 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.159
 searches you 're looking for including 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 town and dry them a text you type 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.920
 region so region string text forward 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.890
 you do 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.479
 ok so we have a first region here and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.200
 look right after we have this 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.900
 start the backup the region 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.180
 zero one here so that's where it's going 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.840
 start so here you have a series 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.290
 four times ff hockey then you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.209
 take twice 0 and from here 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 so the 14 in fact it's my value of 20 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.130
 at the money level so the four 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 first the first four series here 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.440
 you put f400 23 f 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.200
 ok so here we had four series 1 2 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.180
 3 4 and so the last four series 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.349

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.709

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.829
 plenty of money anyway 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.079
 and token so well after the series of 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.880
 f1 we agree the two heroes you 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.220

 while if you see there without great 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.709
