00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:17.450

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.450
 the tutorial 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.490
 comes in two because the files very 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.320
 heavy men wait for me while I 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.669
 my cell phone because I still do not connect it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.669

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.950

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.260
 all compressed files 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 I 'm going to decompress but it's a 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.559
 folder has the same name you do not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.559
 they touch that name having 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.870
 good 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.570
 Fuck well 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.250
 all the following address 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.260
 your cell phone in my case font I repeat 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.260
 a galaxy s2 and a user on me again 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.670
 commented that here in shit I care 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.220
 of the cell phone 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.910
 I do not want to take tica because a lot 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.800
 people have a better operator than mine 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.350
 so actually that does not bother me 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.740
 what are we interested in 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.040
 and illegal weapons or if you are once 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 installed they go and install it once 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 installed 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.280
 we copy the folder 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.350
 and suppose that you are the store and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.870
 they have the folder already copied from the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.740
 folder that comes in from this that 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.310
 folder they copy that that that that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.310
 copy 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.830
 we go to the following address 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.840
 I'm left with an android song or we copy and 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:21.290
 we paste and it will be more or less like this 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.109
 this delays the download also depends 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.349
 how good your cell phone has been 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.349
 all 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.450
 the music is going to stop so fuck 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.450

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.830

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.830
