00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.900
 the band to all guys and welcome in 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.250
 this brand new live cabbage was from 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.960
 years that I didn't do them anymore because I have 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.660
 decided to do this live later 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.160
 so much time because on this game 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.170
 I don't know if it's informer 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.340
 arrived home if the summit and go to 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.900
 page 64 the correct penis road appearance 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.599
 aksu or put in pots to the best videos 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.270
 so however from page 63 part games 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.920
 in farce practically the parody of 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.360
 all those three news and so on 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.870
 but the news struck me a lot 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.420
 since it is put there in the comic sense 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.250
 it is false but it is also true in my opinion 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.500
 now you have this almost dance number 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.120
 informer on hand take it e 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.010
 read it with me if you don't have it 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.320
 they are waiting for you in the whole article 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.100
 sighted but a little piece that broke me 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.360
 the balls 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.620
 the gaming industry as the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.250
 we know today she was born in japan 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.360
 Nintendo Nintendo Sony Solid Snake All 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.610
 Japanese are not journalists 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.260
 professionals like me and so maybe 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 you don't understand how this genre works 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.350
 of things but if you want companies 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.990
 Japanese continue to make games 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.640
 you will have to buy them and so far everything is ok 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.770
 gamers are not doing their part 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.070
 and almost then they were fools then there is one 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.150
 part that tells you that the producers 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.460
 developers etcetera etc. are 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.470
 suffering very poor and give you the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.270
 blame us in the sense that the games of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.430
 companies that have been great as a siga 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 capcom and square enix fail to 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.030
 find the support of the audience that 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.710
 six would deserve you could by guilt and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.240
 public for having published titles 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.900
 mediocre but in the end he had to face 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.360
 reality 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.500
 the fault is yours now I do a 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.010
 very small summary of this 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.600
 question 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.100
 the developers give us against us 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 because we no longer buy the world of 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.920
 developers the gaming world is 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.630
 going to hell because you can't 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.750
 earn money to keep to do 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.100
 more powerful bigger titles more 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.900
 confident we say so is practically the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.670
 Japanese companies and other companies in 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.090
 around the world will be suffering this 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.620
 crisis 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.300
 obviously this article is a parody 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
 therefore a jack for the ass but one 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.000
 what is true is that you are born in 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.479
 various sites like multiplayer etcetera 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 etc 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.540
 you will notice that there are lots of news 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.170
 concerning the world crisis 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.270
 gaming 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.770
 now I wonder but 70 companies are 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.149
 it is not their fault that they are in crisis 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.830
 for example because the call of series 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.399
 duty as modern warfare or as black 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.080
 ops 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.650
 or that of god of war or 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.959
 the different one out 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.970
 also that of mass effect or that of 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.379
 grand tourism or that of the more titles 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.939
 famous in the world because they don't go in 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.680
 crisis those because they practically do 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.209
 titles that interest the public on 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.129
 public obviously buys though 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.780
 know that I am practically the same I speak 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.319
 because another of the modern series 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.489
 warfare 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.409
 but honestly the fault is not ours 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.579
 that we do not buy the securities are in 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.109
 developers who should give themselves a 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.760
 woken up to make more recent titles 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.530
 what do you guys think is fault 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.849
 ours that not like games or blame 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.720
 of developers who do not play games 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.040
 of cents to buy 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.299
 let me know with a comment below 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.950
 I expect your opinion that I 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.079
 this is very interesting in live and ends 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.159
 here to a short live only for per 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.049
 this kind of issues he gives me 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.739
 really so annoying is what to say 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.739
 to the next
