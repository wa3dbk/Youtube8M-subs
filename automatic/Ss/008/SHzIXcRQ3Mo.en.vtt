00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 lack of trucks in the back region 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.120
 you've been by gabriel from the west 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
 really followed the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.269
 Good situation is good always if I 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.460
 I even talked to some 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.410
 drivers and they told me that with 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.910
 Lack of trucks are even choosing 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.170
 the best destination 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.539
 see the report in the companies that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.269
 freight outsourced the tables 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.199
 prices bring the values ​​of the day to 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 the main destinations of the country and in bush 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 they are averaging 20 per cent. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 higher than January 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.910
 when the soybean 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.550
 state 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 the most heavily loaded loads are for 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 ports 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 the cost of freight from são gabriel from the west 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.980
 to the port of paranaguá reaches 160 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 per tonne 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.250
 already to the port of santos the freight does not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.480
 leaves for less than 170 reais per tonne 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.149
 amauri got a load to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 paranagua and already felt the difference in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 pocket a past was $ 145 né this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 160 years now real right here then already 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.270
 saw the improved paraná boim the manager 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.210
 this carrier explains that one of the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.790
 reasons for the adjustment is high in cost 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 of diesel due to fear of fuel 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.390
 in the past that has undergone a readjustment in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.920
 around 15% fred to port today has 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 a steady increase of 20 per 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 cent with the man of the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.079
 fuel or that it helped a lot 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.360
 up freight was the means of accommodation 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.090
 when the oil rises only piece of rubber 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 of tires lubricating oil then everything 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.729
 It has been carrying along this year a year and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.250
 different way, let's say so because 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.560
 there has not been a year like this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 at the peak of the harvest, the demand for 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.579
 transport increases 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 only the trucks are missing another one 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.020
 factor that has influenced the cost of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.570
 freight with behind planting until the year 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.060
 past the harvest of the parana accompanied by the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.189
 mato grosso do sul then the staff does 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 much import as paranaguá did not come 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.710
 seek a product that then fred had 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.310
 up personal power monitoring and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.400
 having the trucks anyway is not 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.019
 charge the volume 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.790
 are expected to have to stay 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.069
 loaded 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.650
 this other company needs 90 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.480
 trucks per day to meet demand 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.189
 but the manager said he can only 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.810
 half of it 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.079
 also leave the field 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.090
 farming is so running own others 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.560
 states that I would run it is great 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.859
 also ne 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.099
 and then it normalizes but this in the beginning 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.230
 of the safrinha is already good for 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.470
 drivers who can choose the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.319
 most advantageous destination front're okay 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.599
 So you can choose, you can choose well. 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.940
 plus the value can still yield that there 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.310
 Where are you going and passersby? 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.709
 chose well to choose well 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.349
 on the other hand the difficulty in 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.629
 transportation also interferes with the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.069
 the routine of those who depend on freight 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.950
 drain the production 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.620
 this time the warehouses need to release 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.019
 space to receive the soy that arrives from the 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.970
 the problem is that the lack of 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.220
 trucks for the outflow of the crop 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.310
 ends up making this work slower 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.769
 is what explains garden brook manager 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.510
 of a cooperative of producers one day 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.599
 normal to collect we will receive here 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.430
 from 35 to 40 thousand sites per day and one 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.620
 interesting for us to the school at a minimum 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.780
 half of that or around 15 to 20 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.419
 thousand sites a day so that we can 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.470
 make room for more 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.109
 receipt right 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.760
 now for now on account of rain 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.810
 Can you run with a little more 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.549
 of tranquility 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.379
 exactly because of the rain the staff is 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.329
 getting spoon then we are 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.000
 getting board is getting a 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.989
 z of the fall is to be able to drain more the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.280
 that we receive 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.959
 so I'm going to need a lot of 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.000
 now it is only time will give a 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.229
 and producer will once again welcome and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.229
 They will need this space. 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.540
 looks at the expectations of drivers and 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.670
 carriers is that this value starts 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.810
 to fall to the end of the crop runoff 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.730
 of soybeans 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.770
 so who has a truck available 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.160
 I used to earn a little more 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.160
 at this time
