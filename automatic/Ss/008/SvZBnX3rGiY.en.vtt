way<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> odd<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:34.680> usually

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
way which is kind of odd because usually

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.060 
they're going this way to the airport
but<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.809> sounded<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.290> close<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
but it just sounded really close and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.520 
but it just sounded really close and
then<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.210> didn't<00:00:42.780> hear<00:00:42.960> any<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.410> of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
then I just I didn't hear any kind of

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.190 
then I just I didn't hear any kind of
like<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> bang<00:00:44.730> or<00:00:44.969> anything<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.750> heard<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
like a bang or anything I just heard it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.709 
like a bang or anything I just heard it
sounded<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.530> plastic<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.399> hit<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> street

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
sounded like plastic like hit the street

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.170 
sounded like plastic like hit the street
and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.100> daughter<00:00:50.280> came<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.000> said

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.600 
down the block in there
was<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.650> plane<00:00:59.830> now<00:01:00.040> on<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.250> right<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.550> the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
was the plane now on the right in the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.550 
was the plane now on the right in the
house<00:01:00.760> but<00:01:01.090> there<00:01:01.270> was<00:01:01.390> nobody<00:01:01.600> here<00:01:02.050> yet<00:01:02.290> that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
house but there was nobody here yet that

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.350 
house but there was nobody here yet that
was<00:01:02.740> like<00:01:02.980> really<00:01:03.460> right<00:01:03.700> when<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:03.970> happened

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
was like really right when it happened

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.410 
was like really right when it happened
so<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:05.230> was<00:01:05.380> just<00:01:05.560> kind<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.980> weird<00:01:06.460> because<00:01:06.820> we

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
so it was just kind of weird because we

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.900 
so it was just kind of weird because we
walked<00:01:07.660> up<00:01:07.870> on<00:01:08.050> it<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.290> just<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:09.610> yelling

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
walked up on it and just we're yelling

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.510 
walked up on it and just we're yelling
into<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.300> house<00:01:10.480> like<00:01:10.870> hello<00:01:11.230> ello<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:12.220> I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
into the house like hello ello but I

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.970 
into the house like hello ello but I
don't<00:01:13.270> think<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.540> couple<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.200> live<00:01:14.740> there

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
don't think the couple that live there

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.700 
don't think the couple that live there
had<00:01:15.220> hurt<00:01:15.460> us<00:01:15.670> because<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.780> really<00:01:17.170> just<00:01:17.200> just

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
had hurt us because it really just just

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.190 
had hurt us because it really just just
happened<00:01:18.160> and<00:01:18.460> then<00:01:19.210> one<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.810> neighbors

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
happened and then one of the neighbors

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.380 
happened and then one of the neighbors
that<00:01:20.230> knows<00:01:21.070> them<00:01:21.400> personally

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
that knows them personally

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.990 
that knows them personally
I<00:01:22.420> guess<00:01:22.900> went<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.410> back<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:23.980> got<00:01:24.280> help

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
I guess went in the back and got help

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.800 
I guess went in the back and got help
them<00:01:25.180> out<00:01:26.670> well<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.700> kind<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.510> know<00:01:28.600> what's

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
them out well I kind of you know what's

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.630 
them out well I kind of you know what's
kind<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.140> odd<00:01:29.410> that<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.860> was<00:01:29.950> going<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.460> way

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
kind of odd that it was going that way

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.760 
kind of odd that it was going that way
is<00:01:30.880> something<00:01:31.119> like<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:32.050> didn't<00:01:32.380> sound<00:01:32.530> right

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
is something like it didn't sound right

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.950 
is something like it didn't sound right
and<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:34.030> kind<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.390> looked<00:01:34.600> like<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.869> was

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
and it kind of looked like it was

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.710 
and it kind of looked like it was
drifting<00:01:35.440> off<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:36.340> know<00:01:36.460> down<00:01:36.970> close<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
drifting off you know down close to the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.380 
drifting off you know down close to the
houses<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:39.640> know<00:01:39.760> every<00:01:40.030> time<00:01:40.240> they

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
houses and you know every time they

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.090 
houses and you know every time they
something<00:01:40.869> goes<00:01:41.050> over<00:01:41.380> really<00:01:41.590> close<00:01:41.830> like

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
something goes over really close like

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.390 
something goes over really close like
that<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:43.119> hold<00:01:43.390> my<00:01:43.540> breath<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.110> know<00:01:44.400> but

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
that I like hold my breath you know but

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.580 
that I like hold my breath you know but
I<00:01:45.550> didn't<00:01:45.880> know<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.450> hit<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.170> we

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
I didn't know that it hit and so we

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.650 
I didn't know that it hit and so we
walked<00:01:47.830> out<00:01:48.040> there<00:01:48.250> in<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.460> front<00:01:48.760> they<00:01:49.330> were
