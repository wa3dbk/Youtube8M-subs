00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
I'm gonna do a video here on the 1982

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:44.030 
I'm gonna do a video here on the 1982
Mercedes<00:02:33.850> created<00:02:34.209> ESL

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.059 

it's<00:02:44.730> good

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
it's good

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.839 
it's good
either<00:02:46.579> works<00:02:46.879> no<00:02:47.209> easy<00:02:47.659> but

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
either works no easy but

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.849 
either works no easy but
because<00:02:50.420> all<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.719> really<00:02:50.749> need<00:02:51.170> got<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> top

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
because all you really need got to top

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.739 
because all you really need got to top
off<00:02:52.129> so<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.670> air<00:02:52.790> conditioning<00:02:53.299> is<00:02:53.420> not<00:02:53.450> that

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:53.749 
off so the air conditioning is not that

00:02:53.749 --> 00:03:01.350 
off so the air conditioning is not that
