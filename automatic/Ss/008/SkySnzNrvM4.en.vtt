00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.820
 to make the change of a route several important points first 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.640
 important point make sure to find an undeveloped land decline and 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.809
 secure the ground being the flatter possible 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.199
 then 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.060
 we will open the door 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.519
 get in the vehicle 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.029
 m 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.699
 to stop a vehicle safely 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.130
 put the first speed released both feet 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.640
 if the car and on a slightly inclined plane to come to land 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.330
 on the gear ratio once it is laid 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 pretty mobilis totally blocking my handbrake 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 then get out of your vehicle safely 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 looking good elsewhere 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.280
 we will open the chest 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.980
 to access the spare wheel we will extract the necessary to lift 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 and unlock the wheels 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 then we will help him and high schools 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 not used to maintain the spare wheel 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.880
 to push until he leaves 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.010
 the walkers 12 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.720
 to pull out the wheel 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.440
 of the vehicle 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.490
 it is now very important to think about closing 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 possibly the doors if some are open 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.980
 that the tailgate 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.440
 before riding the car using the jack 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.400
 I will now proceed to the withdrawal 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.690
 the hubcap 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.690
 freeze the fingers I pull a little alone it comes out alone 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 the stake now the forecasts 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.190
 I'm already starting 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.860
 by unlocking the joystick 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 I begins 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.650
 a little bit 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.660
 the movement from there to the widest part of the jack 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330
 I'm going to ask it 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.690
 on the ground 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.760
 in sentences of the notch 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.840
 destined 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.090
 to position it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.960
 if you have any doubt about 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.069
 setting up the sorting you can also use the record 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.529
 of use 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:13.769
 fillon is general 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.789
 in the glove box 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.069
 yes so I placed 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.179
 the critic 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.499
 on the mark right now 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.879
 I will start 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.879
 slightly 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.530
 before the wheel is fully off I now proceed to 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.439
 a loan of nut locks 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.229
 so I followed 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.879
 after blocking them 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.189
 the echoes 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.189
 here I have now totally thrown 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.289
 the vehicle I require 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.289
 very short cases 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.799
 here I am 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.799
 without him in this sense 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.049
 I retain the euro 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 and I looked for the spare wheel 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.339
 rain showers for winding 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.919
 trouble 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 I said training in France to metz 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.119
 the troops pretty much 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.119
 in front of the holes 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.149
 g 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.659
 so here is to see 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.059
 we can see 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.409
 if we are in front 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.089
 for the lawyer in hand 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.089
 a maximum I blame 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.629
 what I want 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.629
 a little blockage 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.549
 chris would eventually fine-tune site 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:00.529
 so the 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:01.509
 I just 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.839
 poorly blocked summarily 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.129
 group cafes 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.029
 I'm going to the wounded 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.289
 the fic to rest the car and there I will roll totally 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:13.219
 very happy cases by going to see 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.219
 progress the car 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.069
 now that the car is well rested 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.069
 I have checked 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.860
 seven dead 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.879
 we will now 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.749
 repositioned 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.789
 barn leader 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.659
 we have parts 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.379
 more or less narrow 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.439
 regarding the value in May one of the widest parts 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.669
 here is face laval 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.379
 the 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.340
 a little punch 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.770
 these are the sole
