everyone 100 of these floating around
some<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> good<00:00:21.300> things<00:00:21.570> about<00:00:21.750> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
some of the good things about it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.800 
some of the good things about it
it's<00:00:22.619> how<00:00:22.800> small<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.250> quite<00:00:23.789> slim<00:00:24.119> free

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it's how small it is quite slim free

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
it's how small it is quite slim free
light<00:00:25.820> some<00:00:26.820> tea<00:00:26.939> bagging<00:00:27.330> easily<00:00:28.160> one<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
light some tea bagging easily one of the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.990 
light some tea bagging easily one of the
issues<00:00:30.920> it's<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.250> benefit<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:32.700> well<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
issues it's kind of a benefit as well is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.100 
issues it's kind of a benefit as well is
that<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.239> falls<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.410> needy<00:00:35.340> storage<00:00:36.110> but

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that this falls in for needy storage but

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.920 
that this falls in for needy storage but
at<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> same<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> easier

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
at the same time it's one of the easier

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.880 
at the same time it's one of the easier
things<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.260> break

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
things to break

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.610 
things to break
I<00:00:41.180> think<00:00:42.180> folds<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> far<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.469> any

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I think folds back this far so any

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.360 
I think folds back this far so any
damage<00:00:43.829> pressure<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.730> break<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
damage pressure here can break it

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.840 
damage pressure here can break it
folding<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.550> there<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.760> close<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:49.850> bit

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
folding it in there just close it a bit

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
folding it in there just close it a bit
tricky<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:52.370> two<00:00:53.370> things<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:55.160> must<00:00:56.160> time<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
tricky to two things one must time you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
tricky to two things one must time you
plug<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> into<00:00:56.910> laptop<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.360> last<00:00:57.570> night<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
plug it into laptop from last night so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.110 
plug it into laptop from last night so
you<00:00:58.829> might<00:00:58.980> tilt<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> up

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you might tilt it up

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.369 
you might tilt it up
people<00:01:00.690> think<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:00.930> might<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.170> better

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
people think they might get better

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.609 
people think they might get better
coverage<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.920> they<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
coverage if they do that but then with a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
coverage if they do that but then with a
laptop<00:01:04.830> lid<00:01:05.159> open<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.360> followed<00:01:06.689> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
laptop lid open if that's followed in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.490 
laptop lid open if that's followed in
just<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.140> bit

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
just a little bit

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.940 
just a little bit
you<00:01:08.490> bring<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> laptop<00:01:09.000> lid<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you bring a laptop lid down on and you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.240 
you bring a laptop lid down on and you
start<00:01:11.220> putting<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.580> pressure<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:13.250> this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
start putting more pressure on this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880 
start putting more pressure on this
bottom<00:01:14.580> part<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> drink<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.680> what

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
bottom part if it's a drink just what

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.020 
bottom part if it's a drink just what
laptop<00:01:17.820> sits<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:19.680> breaks<00:01:20.030> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
laptop sits here and that breaks and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.100 
laptop sits here and that breaks and
then<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> whole<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.570> useless<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.900> can

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
then the whole thing is useless you can

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.010 
then the whole thing is useless you can
throw<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.670> other<00:01:23.790> thing<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.869> plug

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
throw it out the other thing is you plug

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
throw it out the other thing is you plug
it<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> side<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.670> vertical

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it in from the side if it's a vertical

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.800 
it in from the side if it's a vertical
USB<00:01:27.630> port<00:01:28.549> you've<00:01:29.549> got<00:01:29.820> quite<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> bit<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
USB port you've got quite a bit of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.260 
USB port you've got quite a bit of
height<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.079> which<00:01:31.500> raises<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.250> laptop<00:01:32.670> puts

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
height here which raises the laptop puts

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.050 
height here which raises the laptop puts
more<00:01:33.390> pressure<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.780> again<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.350> joint<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
more pressure on again on this joint and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.140 
more pressure on again on this joint and
again<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.270> link<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> breakages<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
again can link to breakages one of the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
again can link to breakages one of the
things<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.840> suggest<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
things that they would suggest to is to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.670 
things that they would suggest to is to
use<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> extension<00:01:42.240> cables<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.560> know

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
use one of the extension cables you know

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.660 
use one of the extension cables you know
simply<00:01:44.159> plug<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> into<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> slide<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.670> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
simply plug it into the slide and you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.020 
simply plug it into the slide and you
can<00:01:47.820> plug<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.630> 2<00:01:48.689> USB<00:01:48.840> port<00:01:49.610> how<00:01:50.610> many<00:01:50.759> people

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can plug in a 2 USB port how many people

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.749 
can plug in a 2 USB port how many people
do<00:01:51.149> this

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.060 

otherwise<00:01:57.759> on<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.149> back<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.590> take<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.829> door

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
otherwise on the back you take the door

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.539 
otherwise on the back you take the door
off<00:02:00.149> SIM<00:02:01.149> card<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.689> then<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> top<00:02:02.829> microSD

want to put my storage card in there

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.860 
want to put my storage card in there
otherwise<00:02:10.599> it's<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.959> seven<00:02:11.260> magnet<00:02:12.010> device

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
otherwise it's a seven magnet device
