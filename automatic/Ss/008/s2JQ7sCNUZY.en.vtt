00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
thing about the highlight is it is a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.720 
thing about the highlight is it is a

of the highlight and that illuminates

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
of the highlight and that illuminates
the<00:00:56.789> entire<00:00:57.239> background<00:00:57.840> meaning<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the entire background meaning that the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
the entire background meaning that the
light<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.940> normally<00:01:00.300> come<00:01:00.480> from

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
light that would normally come from

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
light that would normally come from
outside<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> background<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.770> reflect<00:01:02.190> onto

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
outside the background and reflect onto

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
outside the background and reflect onto
the<00:01:02.609> model<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.329> coming<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the model is actually coming from the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
the model is actually coming from the
background<00:01:04.199> itself<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.489> you're<00:01:05.610> familiar

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
background itself now if you're familiar

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.060 
background itself now if you're familiar
with<00:01:06.090> shooting<00:01:06.479> Heike<00:01:06.900> photography<00:01:07.619> you're

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
with shooting Heike photography you're

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.910 
with shooting Heike photography you're
probably<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:09.060> familiar<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:10.350> some<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
probably very familiar with some of the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
probably very familiar with some of the
frustrations<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> lighting<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.299> seamless

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
frustrations of lighting a seamless

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.780 
frustrations of lighting a seamless
white<00:01:13.049> background<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.920> first<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
white background so first of all you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
white background so first of all you
have<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> buy<00:01:15.180> backgrounds<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> over

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
have to buy backgrounds over and over

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.609 
have to buy backgrounds over and over
again<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.460> expensive<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
again and that can be expensive and

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.600 
again and that can be expensive and
secondly<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.250> sure<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
secondly you have to make sure that you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
secondly you have to make sure that you
have<00:01:20.729> enough<00:01:21.000> light<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.049> no

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
have enough light that there are no

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100 
have enough light that there are no
shadows<00:01:22.470> falling<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.460> background<00:01:24.150> well

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
shadows falling on that background well

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600 
shadows falling on that background well
the<00:01:25.200> highlight<00:01:25.560> solves<00:01:26.040> both<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.490> those

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the highlight solves both of those

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
the highlight solves both of those
problems<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.869> don't<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.200> buy<00:01:28.350> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
problems one you don't have to buy it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
problems one you don't have to buy it
over<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.829> over<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.430> clean<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.000> can

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
over and over you can clean it you can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
over and over you can clean it you can
use<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.329> again<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> again<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.500> transport

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
use it again and again you can transport

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.740 
use it again and again you can transport
it<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.790> gonna<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> saving<00:01:33.210> money<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it so you're gonna be saving money on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.780 
it so you're gonna be saving money on
those<00:01:33.930> backgrounds<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.770> secondly<00:01:35.549> because

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
those backgrounds and secondly because

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460 
those backgrounds and secondly because
the<00:01:36.060> light<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.240> coming<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> background

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the light is coming from the background

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.100 
the light is coming from the background
you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.220> put<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> model<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.299> very<00:01:39.630> close<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you can put the model very very close to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.690 
you can put the model very very close to
the<00:01:40.140> background<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.189> won't<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> any

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the background and you won't have any

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
the background and you won't have any
shadows<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.040> really
