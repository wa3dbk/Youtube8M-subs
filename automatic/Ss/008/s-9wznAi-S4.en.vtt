 ready to land on the shelves of the world what awaits you 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.820
 it will be a significantly changed action game compared to what we have seen 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.430
 year ago no longer thought for solitary players but everything to deal with 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.810
 cooperating with faithful teammates 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.360
 the result is an action of certain thickness 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.720
 graced by excellent design and art that is characterized by a control system 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 very personal 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.800
 lost planet 2 will once again bring you 3 dm on the planet a dozen 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.040
 years after the events narrated in the previous one 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.790
 how it will look more like the endless holland covered with ice and snow but 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.070
 will invite you to explore highly complex desert villages and forests 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.970
 man-made technology and much more 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.630
 history is no longer centered study only protagonist every episode of 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.590
 will present four soldiers from different factions engaged in different missions 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.150
 in the background, the war against acres beating for the possession of energy 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.390
 Thermal 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.880
 however, as history has taught us human beings also crisis situations 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 does not miss an opportunity to stand against each other with the consequence of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.770
 having to fight soldiers of various kinds 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300
 although enjoyable the plateau told in the main campaign results 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.280
 rather fractionated due to excessive detachment between the phases 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.860
 play the narrative ones 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.570
 detachment caused by the distinctly multiplayer settings of the title that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.670
 they present succession of levels apparently linked to each other only 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.510
 from the cups rather than from a precise philological one 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.020
 Intermezzo control pools are made to have excellent manner

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.540
 the concentration of penalties in the blood of the player preparing the nation 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.140
 the most substantial modality proposed by the title and obviously the campaign 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.350
 main whose maximum attractiveness is represented by the possibility of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.310
 play in the company of three friends 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.520
 in absence dsi you can still be assisted to the artificial intelligence 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.529
 will guide you with discreet stopping abilities for your team 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:15.269
 the adventure is divided into six episodes in turn divided into the lung 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.740
 emissions whose levels stand out for their breadth and excellent design 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.940
 the objectives will always be mainly 2 kill all the enemies 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.160
 that activate the data stations the turrets already seen in the first lost 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.119
 planet 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.159
 this is once activated they will make the map appear on your 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.389
 floor plan of the level as well as possible enemies as many sensitive points 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.719
 furthermore in case of death your sources of respondents will increase 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.789
 score of the battle to be held high to avoid arriving at a 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:43.569
 premature to move and to guarantee an immediate thermal inertia recharge 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.849
 the latter turned out to be a valuable ally as they consume part of the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.089
 escort allows you to recover your vital energy 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.119
 have never liked truth in the goals to be accomplished at 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.199
 the great Perugini will keep the player's attention high 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.459
 ita of the chelating settings possibility of approaches granted by 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.389
 excellent level designer 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.939
 forward shoulders two can count on a truly rich and varied arsenal 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.239
 accompanied by a wide choice of media elements that are obviously routers 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.919
 tactical possibilities an example could be the shield you can 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.330
 exploit particularly delicate situations 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.900
 to defend you and your companions from too powerful heels waiting for 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.429
 right time to return to the attack 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.819
 one of the strong points of capcom production are certainly the places to 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.679
 bibs in this sequel more impressive than ever thanks le 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.089
 disproportionate size of the other hepatocytes the biggest creatures ever 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.539
 seen a shooter 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.719
 and two wings with these monsters you will find yourself managing different tactics 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.839
 compared to the norm in order to force the creature to show points 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.659
 sensitive avoid certain bright areas 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.139
 unfortunately in these cases friendly artificial intelligence shows itself in all 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.339
 its limits given its inability to handle the most complex situations 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:51.839
 created for example diversions by performing tasks other than dodging 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.569
 bullets firing at target 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.299
 enemy soldiers are so always behaved the best way possible 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.380
 if I sell a car, I will drop some tones 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.680
 menini cp amusing to be killed are the others thanks to them 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.699
 considerable variety, number and unpredictability 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.449
 level of challenge proposed and in general quite high license too 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.669
 hoping for peaks of frustration stressed by the particular choices 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.269
 carried out in the control system implementation 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.000
 seven lost planet 2 could seem so expensive 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.240
 Third-person shooter lakes also die from the lack of system 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.979
 coverage but especially in my character site 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.129
 personal proof of its title 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.509
 capcom has made the precise choice of designer that will bring the player to 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.499
 controlling a not very agile alter ego is bound by numerous constraints in 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.539
 especially when you are under attack you will not be able to copy 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.839
 practically at breakfast if not run to look for oviparous 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.019
 it will therefore be possible for example to reload your own weapon also 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.779
 simply disengage from the enemy by directing a grenade even 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.819
 changing weapons will be such a complex task to complete that 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.189
 your character will have to stop in order to perform all of this creates a 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.219
 certain frustration, especially the most agitated situations will be reality 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.369
 more a matter of habit since the time included imposed limits 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.120
 from the clumsiness of your alter ego 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.139
 repaired mastering also grappling hook the situation will improve a lot 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.049
 the frustration however will derive above all from the wicked decision 

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:13.359
 not to implement a checkpoint system if once dead you can 

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:17.189
 take big tits respects the already activated turrets exhausted battle points vi 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.709
 you will find yourself having to restart the whole chapter 

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:22.409
 which could also correspond to tens of minutes of play completely 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.169
 lost this last element considerably lengthens the longevity of the 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.939
 main campaign that can be rectoral taxi driver 6 8 hours in the case there 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.240
 he is never to die and therefore not to repeat long gaming sessions 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.840
 the offer proposed to the capcom title and however decidedly full-bodied e 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.330
 will include an online component that is also competitive and a training mode 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.600
 really useful given the peculiarities of the control system 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.090
 the game so much the complete section in those of home the presence of

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.779
 of the proposed methods 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.319
 ghostrider2 capcom's first title to take advantage of the new engine version 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.599
 proprietary chart 23 fly 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.779
 as for all the other osaka house titles based on the previous one 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.459
 version of this is pregnant the aesthetic appearance decidedly good 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:15.009
 although not excellent as we would have expected in spite of the solidity 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.280
 general really good applaud level of technical details of the 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.089
 used 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:23.279
 7 characters and settings show themselves in certain situations where the octopus is poor 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.059
 pellissier result and in any case decidedly enjoyable 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:29.179
 embellished compact van really remarkable animation with excellent effects 

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:31.570
 graphs with the exclusion of various powders 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.960
 and the excellent lighting system 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.340
 it also points out good design work and above all creatures 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.330
 as well as the frame breite that remains constant in situations 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.319
 more exciting sound polo photos while the music of the year dvd mold yes 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.319
 they only do their job then 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:51.449
 reception work bag received from the first chapter capcom chose to 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.870
 propose a very different following mainly dedicated to users who 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:56.830
 love to have fun together 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.210
 cooperative games with three companions hands in fact capable of giving 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.789
 great satisfactions with very high peaks reached by the pospay 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:08.119
 the sea down the vote we think the level of intelligence of the bots that 

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:12.360
 will accompany you if you decide to play solitary gossip but height 

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:14.960
 especially not manageable with commands of any kind 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.940
 the frustration that has made it able to generate the system's last life 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.759
 check without forgetting the lack of checkpoints your choice of way 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.430
 to see it really difficult to digest, especially if it is difficult to understand 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.720
 plays 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.800
 you and me alone a technical sector usually albeit aesthetically is a 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.310
 excess the presence of competitive online modes complete the rich offer 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.260
 proposed by spam and 2 a title certainly to be taken into consideration 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.279
 if you have three friends with whom to share online shootings 

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:43.189
 However 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.189
 no 

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:51.449
 I have all
