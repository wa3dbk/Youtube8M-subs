00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
also gets toxins out of the body and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
also gets toxins out of the body and
with<00:01:34.409> those<00:01:34.470> toxins<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> body<00:01:35.159> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
with those toxins out of the body it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
with those toxins out of the body it
allows<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.970> metabolism<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little bit better and to just metabolize

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
little bit better and to just metabolize
fat<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> lipids<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:41.280> more

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
fat and lipids just a lot more

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.330 
fat and lipids just a lot more
effectively<00:01:42.200> next<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.320> rubble<00:01:43.590> via<00:01:43.770> condenses

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
effectively next is rubble via condenses

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.880 
effectively next is rubble via condenses
and<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.490> works<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.850> thyroid<00:01:48.299> so
