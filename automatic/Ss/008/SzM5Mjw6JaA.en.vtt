00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
okay so this is a live animal trap it's

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.320 
okay so this is a live animal trap it's
got<00:00:05.339> two<00:00:05.640> ends<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.990> end<00:00:07.230> has<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.799> lever<00:00:08.130> here

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
got two ends one end has this lever here

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.390 
got two ends one end has this lever here
this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.510> where<00:00:09.719> you'll<00:00:09.900> easily<00:00:10.200> open<00:00:10.950> up<00:00:11.099> and

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
this is where you'll easily open up and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.940 
this is where you'll easily open up and
you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.639> put<00:00:11.849> your<00:00:12.030> food<00:00:12.360> right<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.769> the

you can put your food right here in the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.820 
you can put your food right here in the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
very end just a little bit of food

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.640 
very end just a little bit of food
directly<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> trap<00:00:18.289> once<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.529> there

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
directly in the trap once it's there

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.790 
directly in the trap once it's there
then<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.250> close<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.609> lever<00:00:21.170> on<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.500> side

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
then you close that lever on this side

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.570 
then you close that lever on this side
is<00:00:23.220> where<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:23.880> set<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> trap<00:00:25.580> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
is where you actually set the trap and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.930 
is where you actually set the trap and
it's<00:00:26.760> got<00:00:27.000> two<00:00:27.470> rings<00:00:29.449> parallel<00:00:30.740> here<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.759> with

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it's got two rings parallel here so with

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.330 
it's got two rings parallel here so with
two<00:00:33.149> hands<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.670> slide<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> Rings<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
two hands you slide up the Rings and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.990 
two hands you slide up the Rings and
that<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.520> open<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> gate<00:00:40.610> from<00:00:41.610> here

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that will open up the gate from here

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.069 
that will open up the gate from here
then<00:00:42.320> that's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.680> difficult<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> see

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
then that's a little difficult to see

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.160 
then that's a little difficult to see
there's<00:00:46.079> also<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.950> long<00:00:49.820> wire<00:00:50.820> across<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.930> back

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
there's also a long wire across the back

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.850 
there's also a long wire across the back
and<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:54.030> lever<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.170> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and it has a little lever on it and so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.950 
and it has a little lever on it and so
from<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.760> pop<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> up<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
from here you just pop that up and you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.590 
from here you just pop that up and you
cross<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.650> tube<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.060> creates<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:07.490> T

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
cross the tube and it creates a little T

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.609 
cross the tube and it creates a little T
so<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.220> parallel<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> one

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so this one is parallel and this one

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.030 
so this one is parallel and this one
connected<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.369> door<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:16.040> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
connected to the door is up and down and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330 
connected to the door is up and down and
then<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.720> leverage<00:01:18.890> will<00:01:19.890> hold<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> door

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
then that's leverage will hold the door

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.840 
then that's leverage will hold the door
open<00:01:20.990> once<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.860> food<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.280> place<00:01:23.549> in

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
open once you have the food in place in

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.570 
open once you have the food in place in
one<00:01:24.030> end<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.409> trap<00:01:25.710> door<00:01:25.950> open<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
one end and the trap door open in the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.609 
one end and the trap door open in the
other<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.689> you're<00:01:27.869> gonna<00:01:27.960> cover<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.590> entire

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
other then you're gonna cover the entire

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.950 
other then you're gonna cover the entire
trap<00:01:29.630> with<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> towel<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> sheet<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.479> you
