00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello my friends with you shamov 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.150
 Dmitry now we are in biting 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.670
 at an altitude of 1200 meters in fact in the mountains 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.040
 there is still snow here so can i 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.660
 show if there's more to see 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.480
 it is visible that there was snow 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.599
 although the street is now 17 grace warm and 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.300
 here's the development coverage is all mental 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.950
 different cafes in general to myself 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.110
 bite this is a place where here 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.790
 just a huge amount of different 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.649
 punch and now we'll go of course 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.570
 let's go let's go here we come closer 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.090
 with this building here we have two very 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.340
 most interesting place in the first zidhu 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.410
 from the temple which we probably later come down 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.089
 not now because the stairs 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.550
 it will be difficult enough to rise and 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.089
 Now here is such a close structure 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.579
 there he is the son of the source to which 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.440
 put no hand nothing 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.480
 interfered did not mix rights of dollars and how 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.920
 eat from the ground and so let's go 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.920
 let's take a closer look 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 here you can go to see 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 that peculiar smell smells 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.500
 rotten eggs of course 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:40.540
 but the source is hot itself in sight 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 even that's bubbling straight as written 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 in Japanese that we will treat him 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:53.610
 Saving will be very beautiful 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.619
 pebbles down the roof already somehow 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.619
 cases did not inform all the filters you can 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.120
 I like these things very much 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.739
 nice looks let 's go see what 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.930
 I still think there is a lot of things 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.920
 we will definitely see a class 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.920
 show let's go 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.820
 this 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.770
 now we come to one of the most 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.920
 popular places and biting is called and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.630
 for still because see him further I 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.820
 I think that this place is familiar to many 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.790
 because she often comes across in anime 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.840
 For example, if my sister did not look 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.950
 can be so cute 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.600
 Now there is a place, too, was, I think that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.320
 watch can immediately know this place 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.320
 let's go take a closer look 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.720
 of course here is specific too 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.610
 Winston smell of hydrogen sulfide and simply 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.880
 to phuket 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.980
 but the cube is all that great is he a sort 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.720
 which goes 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.290
 thunders out of the land from where and on big 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.239
 enough wealth is he 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.730
 a wooden thud too, the water passes and 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.200
 There goes further if there further against 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.310
 all this will be seen we will 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.310
 let's go see 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.290
 there are so many different people because 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.790
 what is it 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.230
 instead 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.230
 Japanese landmark 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.459
 let's go let's go let's go 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.270
 it is now very warm probably degrees 18 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.270
 thousand from you can jacket is very hot 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.410
 although in the mountains 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.230
 seen there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.660
 on the other side raises the decoction so 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.560
 burned high schools 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.900
 there is 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.900
 such is the water and the sun on 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.350
 sold on because from here to there 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.350
 rises 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:41.089
 we will go take a closer look here 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.270
 see that for me is a place where a 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:43.270
 one 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.169
 wet your feet at the source of water 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:53.219
 birch is straight and sleep is a dream and she is hot 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.659
 Of course, I understand completely 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.659
 no charge for it 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.879
 so everyone can take off their shoes 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.409
 lower your legs and relax a bit 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.629
 water in general and the sun itself 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.050
 healing so that's why I'm all wounds 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:14.090
 will heal and fatigue will pass immediately 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.090
 so let's go great 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.560
 maybe she will 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.680
 I went 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.680
 they 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.629
 practically reached did not leave 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.199
 here you can see that the water is hiding down here 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:57.650
 on these wooden boards like this but 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.360
 we have to go down 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.630
 then we will continue and already when we go down 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.630
 On the stairs 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.539
 we went down here even hotter i don't 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.560
 I know how many degrees this he himself 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.320
 which is behind me 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.669
 because of him, it's all so straight 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.260
 feel some kind of hot 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.260
 some summer now on the street 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.030
 great baby closer look 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:30.700
 you can see that the water is just unreal clean 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.700
 well and hot of course 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.300
 but she walks on these u wooden 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.590
 the boards go down the end already 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.590
 the way is a little cool 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:47.830
 in general it can be translated in the attack as 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.920
 onson fields 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.139
 hot water fields because you are 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.949
 hieroglyph 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.440
 and boiling water to move away from chipping attack it 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.140
 will 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.590
 so the field hot arose with it 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.590
 they are 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.170
 cool frame on the other hand 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.170
 to sit 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.950
 and here, too, it takes a little bit here is 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.670
 hot water could only be so you 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.670
 twist 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:28.150
 they are not very hot as a bath 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.470
 degrees 40 maybe 42 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.610
 feels like 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.610
 what is watching the bus 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.430
 so cool 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.330
 yellow green you can see what it is 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.330
 tourist bus 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.670
 here is such a place 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.830
 for yet 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.960

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.569
