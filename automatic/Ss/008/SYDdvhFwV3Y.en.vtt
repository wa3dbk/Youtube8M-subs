00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.719
 look back bicycle 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 material steel it cycles wonderfully 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.059
 automatic switching 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.059
 really a great bike 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.020
 no idea of â€‹â€‹our weight at all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 you carry on a bicycle 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.900
 He's just a very strong indeed 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900
 manager could cycle 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.030
 really have a super nice something and fish 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 still nice than me too 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.650
 the dutch designer is jan gunneweg 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.500
 crazy about wood it inspired him to it 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.520
 design of a unique wooden bicycle 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.020
 solid 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.110
 wonderful to ride on beautiful 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.150
 from the moment I can walk yes 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.910
 I'm already working on wood and I have one first 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.220
 small beans built afterwards 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.830
 cabins built in a mine and so is 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.970
 in no place emerged immediately pale 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.070
 it also became a very good one 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.190
 bicycles are about how robust it was and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.470
 after almost ten years I have my first one 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.820
 wooden bike so he dropped his time to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.850
 move the power of keeping them 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 flexibility the heat also on yes 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.259
 power 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.880
 This is a huge job than the jacket imagined 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.729
 you the bike was huge yes then go 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.680
 I see if we can do something more with that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.140
 I am very busy about being busy 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.360
 something I had developed by myself 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.200
 to build something where something beautiful more 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 people can enjoy 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.369
 the first time I am on that bike 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.380
 tattoo have that feeling so confirm this 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.159
 is a kind of feeling of happiness the you me 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.750
 achieve 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.310
 this is this is so different so special 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.050
 maybe there is feeling like we are 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.750
 is also included as a slogan 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.040
 be moved by nature it is it is you 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.040
 is helped by nature 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.819
 bicycle is produced by toast 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.980
 woodwork in staphorst 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.430
 the cyclists made from 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.019
 in country french oak 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.150
 of course you want a bike that years and years 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.510
 lasts for years and then you come out 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.959
 soaking it is sustainable wood comes out 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.570
 France 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.280
 sustainably managed forests and simply whole 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.680
 well resistant to the loot and 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.060
 weather conditions 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.820
 then just come to our company 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.550
 Loafers do and wood was planed 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.860
 the wood is granted 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.060
 we make the frame in two parts 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.630
 is sent to our computer-controlled 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.870
 machines were cheering the medium strangely 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.860
 built up means that those two parts 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 not everyone 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.820
 or natural product are separate 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.390
 have powers of a quarter of one 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.730
 big thick part and therefore each other get the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.440
 and together an enormously stable 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.959
 frame shape were more of the keeping fish 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.900
 that blanket that it is really European 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.590
 Oak wood is it keeps it alive 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.739
 does not know how how does a bit come in 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.739
 back 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.190
 due to its natural appearance the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.440
 bike not only suitable for the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.410
 private market also very interesting 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.510
 for business are here 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.360
 for example, 16 bicycles at Schiphol 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.799
 you can use to make appointments 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.239
 appointment to cycle or to 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.510
 terminal 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.310
 cycle on the left 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.620
 it is also in sting so as a sign of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.430
 rent it is a statement 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.030
 dare to think differently of the world 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.030
 change 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.230
 we are unbelievable many aspects each 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.700
 when we deliver a bike 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.709
 we do not yet know what will happen 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.659
 with the only one thing know that 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.760
 it becomes a kind of oil slick every time 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.319
 gets bigger gets a big brakes and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.549
 what ignites other people because yes 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.280
 very special 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.819
 the construction biker that is someone who you courage 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.730
 has to get on a bike but 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.730
 everyone admires
