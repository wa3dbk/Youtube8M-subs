00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.279
 After some time I would like to go again 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.469
 is back is already for months 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.709
 asked if my wand videos 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.480
 make yes and continue for some 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.029
 So now at least all of them 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.609
 this germany from or also from 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.279
 a collection of usa and therefore 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.800
 I'll show you some again today 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.539
 I'll show you the rest of the order 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.929
 of the phoenix as a foreigner mcgonagall 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.989
 or rather good 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.350
 The first must show first died 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.899
 he is still relatively short although he is short 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 that is also relatively difficult and me 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.399
 think there is due to this ball 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.600
 Pretty good hand all around here 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.449
 the bars then still not big 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.590
 should say 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.390
 with other videos or heaps 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.359
 but I would talk 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.370
 actually only the bars show for 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.539
 This interprets interested people I 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.760
 then maybe here is also buy 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.780
 want 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.370
 So I think mom died really well 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.800
 at least the old one in the classic 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.690
 edition still needs the anni wendler box 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:19.570
 there are in the red 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.570
 Blue and white always big to say 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.390
 But so from then in Harry Potter and the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.410
 Deathly Hallows Part 1 has returned 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.330
 new dust 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.480
 even if it is not recommended now 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.730
 it's really obvious because it's small 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.430
 The one you see looks normal 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.010
 wand sees well there just very briefly 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.460
 in a chase in the sky because 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.240
 in the house dsh be his stock the quotas 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.590
 he has not had a stick 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.270
 why they did that, they still do 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.730
 new modes have brought home to everyone 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.900
 case is a whole bit longer 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.170
 real body and that too a whole 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.360
 is difficult piece and I find more 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.660
 so big in the club is so bulky is lying 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.560
 because not so good in the hand 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.180
 I do not understand why they are here 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.970
 nor these these bright stripes 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.320
 Rangoon have no order there 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.850
 considered in any case as a human yet 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.709
 moody's options definitely me 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.030
 old recommend the small at the new 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.420
 It's not that great but it's great 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.570
 is tank stop as at least in appearance 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.040
 so here with this sheet not 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.090
 buckle plate from wiefels 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.140
 carnivorous plant which is why women 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:41.810
 See and see children themselves 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.790
 these brown stripes as to fight 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.320
 is now rather poorly suited 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.239
 said because of a flat that children there 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.790
 just pause it easily podcast it 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.320
 actually very stable 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.320
 sometimes it is not to overplay halt 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.100
 then hammer kingsley died i think 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.590
 there is actually good in the hand too 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.170
 if I have no idea what exactly that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.380
 handle adjusted I think that sees 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.220
 a bit like a hand or like that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:18.000
 the foot of something that was so im 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.530
 as no idea but I think 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.050
 here too my frosty should be mine 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.200
 Griffs could see these thin ones 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.790
 strict because I do not know how stable that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.180
 if you have to be right now 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:35.700
 has a good mood that has a man 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.380
 Thanks so die died like that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.760
 actually not at all, he lies indeed 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.890
 good hand said that look 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.730
 that this golden thing out here 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.800
 wrestle with vision 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.380
 There are also some on cigars 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.750
 Things wrestling looks something like this 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.290
 I do not like at all and behind 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.240
 Attack one has from a lion's head yes 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.380
 So as I said actually at all 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.590
 not even with a good hand 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:06.510
 it is just comparatively thick and 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.130
 creams yes like the character 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.040
 edition still has the name clips 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.209
 but I think I'm interested 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.300
 not so with the bars because of it 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.930
 I'll show you with God that you can 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.459
 wands of the Order of the Phoenix and yes 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.760
 then we can go around the others 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.760
 voice
