00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hey people of me it is today times 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.529
 again a new dm has become in the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.750
 last weeks a little bit 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 what accumulated I start directly with 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.740
 A new product will formally become and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.460
 though, that mascara is here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.379
 which means if lashes and has 395 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.420
 tasted and I just have it myself 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.699
 taken away because just new and he was 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.020
 So has a rubber brush and had 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.279
 I did not want that before 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 I just try it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.730
 However, I have to say that it is me 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.429
 not so good now if you like 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.560
 really on natural eyelashes stands 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.350
 which are really just beautiful separated 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 but not very long or very voluminous 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.510
 Maybe that's what it looks like 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.250
 right for you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.870
 but that's just not enough for me 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 find the brush to the trends was right 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.710
 good but the eyelashes are not now 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 necessarily much longer and shaped 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.160
 that's why I would not think so now 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.690
 Buy again after I'll stay 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 the same time in the eyes I have me 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.500
 bought two new eyeshadows from p2 and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 while this one here that it is so 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 a cream eyeshadow in gold that can 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 Just turn it out and then 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.850
 you can apply the so-on eyes 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.649
 and then with your finger or with the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.439
 I have now blinded the brush 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.750
 color 0.50 bvb when I find that it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.189
 rather a gold shimmering find that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.600
 I think I'm really great for the summer 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.520
 likes that then really like when the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.970
 eyes just totally shimmer and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 shine and that cost 295 then 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.700
 I have as I said one more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 second eyeshadow brought and indeed 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 Again from the p2 this is the e3 here 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 shadow in the color 230 afterwork the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 is now really great 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.549
 pigmented eyeshadow, too 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.200
 really beautiful shimmers and paid so 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.939
 like I said in the summer I like something like that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.829
 always very happy and he has three now 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.540
 different colors in it once so 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.400
 a turquoise and such a green and so on 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.560
 easy yellow one can then easily 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 So mix and apply together or 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.140
 again individually and separately and the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 are really really good too 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 pigmented and shimmering as I said 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.060
 very nice and he has tasted 295 of 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 essence I looked then again an 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.329
 penzel taken in the color 0 2 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.340
 I'm pretty much using brown 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.689
 long for my eyebrows and you like 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 I also very much I think that's 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.829
 again in a lighter tone and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 again in black the comes then 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.829
 foal again with such a desert 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.380
 where to put your eyebrows in again 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.970
 can bring form and as I said with the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.170
 I can then just form it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.840
 pull or just roll your eyes 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 fill in and he has only 95 cents 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.000
 tasted 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.319
 then I have a new lip 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.959
 Product of Bel Air discovered and indeed 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.310
 is that this lip oil with coconut scent 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.900
 I already had that on the homepage 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.459
 seen and I knew immediately that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.380
 I definitely want to buy it 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.140
 to try it out and I like it a lot 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.700
 glad it comes with so rola and there 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.840
 then just get the oil out and then 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.650
 Can you do that as well as the lips 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.390
 apply 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 I think it makes the lips very soft 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.959
 I am anyway, the total oil and fan 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.120
 I also think that's really cool 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.040
 as lip gloss replacement because the oil is pulling 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.959
 not right now 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.790
 the skin as you can that also eg via 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.200
 Apply the lipstick if you like that 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.580
 for example, I like it right now 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.130
 summer as a son already very nice 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.810
 and that cost 95 cents 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.299
 I also have this from p2 still this 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.970
 primer bought here that is the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.650
 perfect face make a face primer that is 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.209
 now such a shimmering primer of 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.860
 Just make it on the face 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.000
 on it before you turn up as a make-up 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.950
 or you can do it theoretically 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.299
 is simply applied to the skin 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.950
 leaves a really nice 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.989
 shimmer and I think there you see 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.170
 somehow wake up I had the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.459
 months ago always at home 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.260
 But then sometime had 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.519
 stopped buying the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.109
 That's why I just wanted him now 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.489
 have again because just in the summer 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.470
 It is always nice with such a 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.180
 extra shimmer what you but there 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.040
 So I have to notice 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.930
 if you put up a little bit 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.880
 applying face that make up then 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.040
 not as nice to the skin a 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.269
 So he pulls out helps that is spared 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.739
 make-up last longer but you are allowed to 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.880
 really not too much on the skin 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.889
 give so you have a bit 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.459
 watch out but otherwise I like him 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.720
 very much and who has tasted 395 of 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.250
 evelyn then I have two more 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.980
 I bought products once 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.209
 this facial cleansing brush 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.650
 bought later that I got I use yes 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.720
 already super long and I think easy 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.010
 that makes the skin totally soft and 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.420
 The cleaning is just a lot better 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.670
 I always do this 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.840
 cleansing foam from on it and 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.370
 then I just pass that in 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.650
 face and then I wait that completely 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.090
 normal and water off and this face 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.709
 cleaning brush is now in the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.239
 other color was always there before 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.250
 only transparent and now there are those 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.870
 also in pink and I believe in green 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.790
 So I think that's really cool because of me 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.010
 I think that's a lot better, of course 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.829
 very bad now and I mean 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.120
 that cost 295 then I have me 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.320
 as I said a new product of 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.240
 brought evelyn and 2 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.130
 that eyelash curler here in black 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.590
 I 've never had one like this before 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.790
 I just wanted to try it 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.160
 and it was not expensive, I think 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.990
 yes 295 tasted and I have it now 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.220
 I've recovered many times before and I have to 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.870
 really say it does make a 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.490
 I also differed a lot 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.020
 want to try that is that with you 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.060
 the hair dryer heated so a bit before 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.430
 and then the eyelashes once in form 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.900
 if that brings one again 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.130
 bigger difference is there I am 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.570
 in any case already curious 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.280
 but I'm definitely glad that 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.140
 I bought them as well 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.090
 me from the p2 nor the new case 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.490
 Lashes brought and that are once 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.460
 this extreme volume if lashes and 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.440
 the intense a false lash is this 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.030
 I think they are both new to me 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.890
 I was really happy about it because of me 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.710
 the p2 eyelashes are always 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.420
 Totally good and this extreme volume 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.450
 Lashes I have ever been in one 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.320
 worn makeup tutorial and that 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.150
 Maybe I can do summer festival too 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.680
 I pack again in the infobox 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.780
 they're just a bit behind 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.240
 longer than the front then what I then for such a 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.310
 yalook totally great so find something 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.960
 with disguises or where you just like that 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.390
 have a dramatic eye look 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.830
 because they are really great and this 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.600
 I have not tried this yet 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.460
 Now these hearts fall in case 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.220
 lashes but the look really great 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.170
 because they are just half eyelashes 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.970
 when they do not go around completely and 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.920
 cover everything but there is the 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.660
 probably then only as the end of 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.980
 the eyelashes at the end again more 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.150
 give volume and they really look 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.500
 very natural 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.910
 I'm definitely very much 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.830
 looking forward to it and I think such 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.690
 you can theoretically also in everyday life 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.870
 Wear or if you go away or something 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.280
 and they have now tasted 295 each 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.140
 I still have this from valea 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.930
 shower cream taken that is now 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.460
 with lime and aloe vera smell the 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.660
 really smells really good for that 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.940
 summer I find such an odor always 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.530
 very great and refreshing and that has 45 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.540
 Cents cost me there 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.220
 definitely a new insect protection 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.750
 take prix so I use it 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.040
 really many in the summer 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.200
 I had already told you that 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.340
 have a mosquito bite allergy and 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.530
 so I have me not easy 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.940
 protect because it itches otherwise super through 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.770
 and they are getting really fat and 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.300
 swell and there it is on everyone 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.770
 better to protect yourself from everyone 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.800
 That was also a tick protection 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.940
 for up to four hours 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.470
 So I find in the summer if you then 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.180
 then somehow picnicking should be 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.650
 you have something somehow always there 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.050
 it does not smell that great now though 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.849
 better one is protected than that one on the 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.970
 end yet again has many total prints 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.199
 and that costs 295 the last product 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.849
 is a deo what I am now too 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.830
 I've made up for that again 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:46.220
 actually always at home because that's it 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.229
 Ballet antiperspirant spray in three 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.550
 I always like that very much because it is 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.199
 also protects well and it has one 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.550
 I like the neutral smell 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.190
 somehow always the best 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.479
 and therefore cost 65 cents yes that was 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.919
 it again from the things the 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.629
 I got so in the last few weeks 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.250
 I was perhaps even something for you 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.750
 I hope in any case that I 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.039
 my video has fallen and I see 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.039
 Next time you bite again then
