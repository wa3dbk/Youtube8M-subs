00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.270
 this option there but when you 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.770
 put a man all this going 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 to do is that it's going to put a 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.160
 first run in your status bar 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.960

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.340
 even if your iphone and its vibration mode 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.899
 or not here with the button does that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.550
 of course it works when you're on 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.860
 the lockscreen when your iphone is 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 locked fac ci for example here i have 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.720
 my iphone 5 i send myself notification 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.490
 then it will make noise brain vibrate 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.470
 it's normal because I'm in the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.700
 sprint bole so the iphone is said you are 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.250

 we will see that the iphone all the same 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.340
 received the notification then why the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.130
 still received it's because the moon 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.479

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.899
 pavie brini sonic
