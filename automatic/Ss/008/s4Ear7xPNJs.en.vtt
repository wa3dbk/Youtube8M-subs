typography if you don't know what that

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.770 
typography if you don't know what that
is<00:00:07.560> just<00:00:08.040> head<00:00:08.189> over<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.639> Google<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.210> have

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
is just head over to the Google and have

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.620 
is just head over to the Google and have
a<00:00:09.809> look-see<00:00:10.580> here<00:00:11.580> are<00:00:11.759> some<00:00:11.940> relevant<00:00:12.300> images

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
a look-see here are some relevant images

a look-see here are some relevant images
I<00:00:12.780> found<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.849> topographical<00:00:14.849> map<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.330> one<00:00:15.599> that

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
I found a topographical map is one that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.080 
I found a topographical map is one that
uses<00:00:15.870> contour<00:00:16.500> lines<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.490> represent<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
uses contour lines to represent the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.220 
uses contour lines to represent the
changes<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.750> elevation<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:20.160> area<00:00:21.020> all<00:00:22.020> that

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
changes in elevation in an area all that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.480 
changes in elevation in an area all that
doesn't<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.590> matter<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.220> helps<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
doesn't really matter but it helps to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
doesn't really matter but it helps to
know<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.850> background<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.359> guess<00:00:24.740> I've

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
know a little background I guess I've

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.529 
know a little background I guess I've
just<00:00:25.800> always<00:00:26.039> thought<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:26.670> cool<00:00:26.880> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
just always thought they look cool so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.269 
just always thought they look cool so
we're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> draw<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.529> today<00:00:28.800> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
we're going to draw one today it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
we're going to draw one today it's
really<00:00:29.519> easy<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:31.800> you're<00:00:31.920> going

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
really easy the first thing you're going

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.290 
really easy the first thing you're going
to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.700> draw<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> blob<00:00:34.070> yep<00:00:35.070> everyone<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.180> do

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to do is draw a blob yep everyone can do

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.400 
to do is draw a blob yep everyone can do
it<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:37.380> doesn't<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> look<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.340> blob

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
it it doesn't have to look like my blob

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
it it doesn't have to look like my blob
then<00:00:40.410> draw<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.190> outline<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.390> blob

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
then draw an outline around your blob

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.580 
then draw an outline around your blob
and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.730> outline<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.940> again<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.570> again<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and then outline it again and again and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
and then outline it again and again and
again<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> keep<00:00:48.300> outlining<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:50.629> at<00:00:51.629> some

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
again and keep outlining it at some

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
again and keep outlining it at some
point<00:00:52.410> fill<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> middle<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> blob<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
point fill in the middle of the blob the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
point fill in the middle of the blob the
same<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> keep<00:00:55.649> making<00:00:55.949> these

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
same way now as you keep making these

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 
same way now as you keep making these
outlines<00:00:56.510> try<00:00:57.510> making<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.109> parts<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
outlines try making some parts of the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
outlines try making some parts of the
outlines<00:00:59.039> consistently<00:01:00.030> close<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.510> each

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
outlines consistently close to each

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680 
outlines consistently close to each
other<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.710> farther<00:01:02.070> apart<00:01:02.539> on<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
other and some farther apart on a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
other and some farther apart on a
topographic<00:01:04.320> map<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.460> lines<00:01:05.640> close

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
topographic map if there are lines close

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
topographic map if there are lines close
together<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.689> means<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.619> there's<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> steep

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
together it means that there's a steep

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.850 
together it means that there's a steep
slope<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> lines<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.439> further<00:01:10.680> apart

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
slope and if the lines are further apart

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.660 
slope and if the lines are further apart
it<00:01:11.340> means<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.450> gradual<00:01:12.930> slope<00:01:13.670> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it means it is a more gradual slope so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
it means it is a more gradual slope so
you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.330> outlining<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you can see I'm just outlining here you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.929 
you can see I'm just outlining here you
know<00:01:16.740> making<00:01:17.189> some<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> lines<00:01:17.640> close

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
know making some of the lines close

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.719 
know making some of the lines close
together<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> ballooning<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.159> some<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
together kind of ballooning out some of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
together kind of ballooning out some of
the<00:01:20.820> others<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.530> don't<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> can

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the others I don't know if you can

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
the others I don't know if you can
visualize<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.840> might

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
visualize a little bit what this might

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.010 
visualize a little bit what this might
look<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.640> if<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.790> were<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> mountain<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
look like if this were a mountain or a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
look like if this were a mountain or a
physical<00:01:28.530> piece<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.920> land<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.090> feel<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
physical piece of land but I feel like I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
physical piece of land but I feel like I
can<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.680> something<00:01:31.920> forming<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.579> my

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
can kind of see something forming in my

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
can kind of see something forming in my
mind<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.299> point<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:34.409> course<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.549> more<00:01:35.759> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
mind at this point of course the more I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
mind at this point of course the more I
draw<00:01:36.150> them<00:01:36.390> where<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> add<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.740> more

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
draw them where I add to it the more

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.460 
draw them where I add to it the more
complicated<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.579> gets<00:01:38.900> it<00:01:39.900> gets<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.290> bit

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
complicated it gets it gets a little bit

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
complicated it gets it gets a little bit
more<00:01:40.619> difficult<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.270> doesn't<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.600> help

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
more difficult so it doesn't really help

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.429 
more difficult so it doesn't really help
but<00:01:43.310> another<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.000> however<00:01:45.439> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
but another thing you can do however to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.940 
but another thing you can do however to
mix<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.500> off<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.920> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
mix it up a little is to go off to a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.480 
mix it up a little is to go off to a
blank<00:01:50.280> spot<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> paper<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.189> make<00:01:53.189> another

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
blank spot in the paper and make another

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.209 
blank spot in the paper and make another
blob<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.210> start<00:01:54.899> making<00:01:55.229> outlines<00:01:55.649> around<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
blob and start making outlines around it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
blob and start making outlines around it
but<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> same<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.780> keep<00:01:58.200> making

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
but at the same time keep making

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.550 
but at the same time keep making
outlines<00:01:59.009> around<00:01:59.579> your<00:01:59.790> first<00:02:00.030> blob<00:02:00.560> once
