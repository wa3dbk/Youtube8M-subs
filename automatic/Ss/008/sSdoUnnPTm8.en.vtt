00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300 

in<00:00:00.170> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.530> want<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> talk<00:00:02.040> about

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
in this video I want to talk about

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.370 
in this video I want to talk about
transcription<00:00:02.730> initiation<00:00:03.300> in<00:00:03.870> eukaryotes

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
transcription initiation in eukaryotes

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.920 
transcription initiation in eukaryotes
now<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.640> one<00:00:05.819> specifically<00:00:06.420> we're<00:00:06.810> going

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
now in this one specifically we're going

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.200 
now in this one specifically we're going
to<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.200> for<00:00:07.350> mRNA<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> initiation

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
to do it for mRNA so it's the initiation

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.259 
to do it for mRNA so it's the initiation
of<00:00:09.679> mRNA<00:00:10.679> transcription<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.429> eukaryotes<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
of mRNA transcription in eukaryotes and

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.570 
of mRNA transcription in eukaryotes and
I<00:00:12.690> wrote<00:00:12.840> here<00:00:12.990> beware<00:00:13.280> silliness<00:00:14.280> ahead<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
I wrote here beware silliness ahead I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.860 
I wrote here beware silliness ahead I
might<00:00:14.790> say<00:00:14.910> some<00:00:15.059> silly<00:00:15.269> things<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.750> this

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
might say some silly things in this

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
might say some silly things in this
video<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.890> apologize<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.490> advance<00:00:17.550> if

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
video so I apologize in advance if

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.230 
video so I apologize in advance if
that's<00:00:18.119> off-putting<00:00:18.300> anybody<00:00:19.250> okay<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
that's off-putting anybody okay so the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
that's off-putting anybody okay so the
first<00:00:21.449> thing<00:00:21.630> that's<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> happen<00:00:22.140> is

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
first thing that's going to happen is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.250 
first thing that's going to happen is
that<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.100> DNA<00:00:23.400> DNA<00:00:24.330> has<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.660> tata<00:00:25.080> box

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
that if we have DNA DNA has the tata box

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.250 
that if we have DNA DNA has the tata box
in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> promoter<00:00:25.830> region<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.400> eukaryotes<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
in the promoter region of eukaryotes so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.359 
in the promoter region of eukaryotes so
the<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:28.800> thing<00:00:28.890> that's<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> happen

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the first thing that's going to happen

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.569 
the first thing that's going to happen
is<00:00:29.730> transcription<00:00:30.570> factor<00:00:30.840> 2d<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is transcription factor 2d is going to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.049 
is transcription factor 2d is going to
bind<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.239> tata<00:00:33.450> box<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:34.710> how<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
bind the tata box now how can it do that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.450 
bind the tata box now how can it do that
transcription<00:00:37.020> factor<00:00:37.380> 2d<00:00:37.739> contains<00:00:38.309> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
transcription factor 2d contains this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
transcription factor 2d contains this
thing<00:00:38.930> tbp<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.620> TVP<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> thing<00:00:42.210> called

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
thing tbp now TVP is this thing called

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.310 
thing tbp now TVP is this thing called
the<00:00:42.629> tata<00:00:43.230> binding<00:00:43.500> protein<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.809> tata

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the tata binding protein so that tata

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
the tata binding protein so that tata
binding<00:00:46.530> protein<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:48.059> allows

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
binding protein is what allows

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.720 
binding protein is what allows
transcription<00:00:48.960> factor<00:00:49.230> 2d<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.489> bind

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
transcription factor 2d to actually bind

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.860 
transcription factor 2d to actually bind
the<00:00:50.940> tata<00:00:51.120> box<00:00:52.160> upon<00:00:53.160> binding<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> tata<00:00:53.699> box

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
the tata box upon binding the tata box

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
the tata box upon binding the tata box
the<00:00:54.870> tin<00:00:55.170> scratches<00:00:55.620> term<00:00:55.739> factor<00:00:55.920> 2d<00:00:56.370> after

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the tin scratches term factor 2d after

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.170 
the tin scratches term factor 2d after
it<00:00:56.850> binds<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.660> recruits<00:00:58.370> RNA<00:00:59.370> polymerase<00:00:59.820> 2

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it binds it recruits RNA polymerase 2

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
it binds it recruits RNA polymerase 2
along<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.170> some<00:01:01.350> transcription<00:01:01.770> factors

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
along with some transcription factors

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.200 
along with some transcription factors
with<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.780> tata<00:01:04.080> box<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.220> region

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
with it to the tata box and this region

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
with it to the tata box and this region
here<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.350> RNA<00:01:07.710> polymerase<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.340> transcription

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
here so RNA polymerase and transcription

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
here so RNA polymerase and transcription
factors<00:01:09.180> 2<00:01:09.390> h<00:01:09.750> e<00:01:10.290> F<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.420> B<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:13.110> join<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.430> form

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
factors 2 h e F a and B all join to form

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.359 
factors 2 h e F a and B all join to form
this<00:01:14.820> thing<00:01:15.030> called<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> pre<00:01:16.369> initiation

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
this thing called the pre initiation

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.249 
this thing called the pre initiation
complex<00:01:20.150> it's<00:01:21.150> also<00:01:21.360> known<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.900> basal

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
complex it's also known as the basal

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.450 
complex it's also known as the basal
complex<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> how<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> remember<00:01:26.159> these

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
complex so how do you remember these

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.050 
complex so how do you remember these
details

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
details

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.450 
details
well<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> way<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> remember<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.369> well<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
well the way I remember it is well it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.960 
well the way I remember it is well it
smashing<00:01:29.970> factors<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.570> h<00:01:30.900> e<00:01:31.290> F<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:31.950> B<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
smashing factors to h e F a and B and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
smashing factors to h e F a and B and
then<00:01:33.060> having<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.450> RNA<00:01:33.689> polymerase<00:01:34.020> 2

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
then having it with RNA polymerase 2

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
then having it with RNA polymerase 2
well<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.009> me<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.280> too<00:01:35.460> difficult<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
well for me it's not too difficult to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
well for me it's not too difficult to
understand<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.540> RNA<00:01:36.810> polymerase<00:01:37.110> 2<00:01:37.350> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
understand that RNA polymerase 2 is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.539 
understand that RNA polymerase 2 is
gonna<00:01:37.560> come<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.130> already<00:01:38.280> know

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
gonna come in because I already know

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
gonna come in because I already know
that<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:39.180> talking<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.540> mRNA

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that I'm talking about mRNA

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
that I'm talking about mRNA
transcription<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.610> about<00:01:41.790> or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
transcription the way I think about or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
transcription the way I think about or
the<00:01:42.600> way<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> remember<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:43.920> transcription

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the way I remember which transcription

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.429 
the way I remember which transcription
factors<00:01:44.729> come<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> start

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
factors come in is we're about to start

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.069 
factors come in is we're about to start
a<00:01:46.560> party<00:01:46.890> we're<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> transcribe<00:01:48.390> some

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
a party we're about to transcribe some

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.539 
a party we're about to transcribe some
mRNA<00:01:49.590> party<00:01:50.340> time<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:52.110> fab<00:01:55.430> joins<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
mRNA party time so he fab joins the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
mRNA party time so he fab joins the
party<00:01:56.880> he's<00:01:57.329> fabulous<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.110> he's<00:01:58.229> ready<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
party he's fabulous and he's ready to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.209 
party he's fabulous and he's ready to
party

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
party

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.149 
party
ok<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> might<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.049> silly<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
ok so that might be a little silly to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950 
ok so that might be a little silly to
some<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.149> that's<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> way<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
some of you but that's the way I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.929 
some of you but that's the way I
remember<00:02:04.350> about<00:02:04.469> which<00:02:05.430> transcription

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
remember about which transcription

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.850 
remember about which transcription
factors<00:02:06.479> are<00:02:06.630> coming<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.020> ok<00:02:08.270> now

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
factors are coming here ok now

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.370 
factors are coming here ok now
that<00:02:10.190> pre-initiation<00:02:10.580> complex<00:02:11.260> what<00:02:12.260> that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that pre-initiation complex what that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.950 
that pre-initiation complex what that
allows<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:13.010> it's<00:02:13.490> basically<00:02:14.150> stabilizes

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
allows for is it's basically stabilizes

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020 
allows for is it's basically stabilizes
the<00:02:15.020> helix<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.530> begins<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.130> open<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.820> and

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
the helix and begins to open it up and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.480 
the helix and begins to open it up and
get<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.240> ready<00:02:17.330> for<00:02:17.450> transcription<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.860> this

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
get it ready for transcription so this

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.640 
get it ready for transcription so this
here<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:19.940> now<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.240> open<00:02:20.900> complex<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.470> want

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
here is now the open complex that I want

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.850 
here is now the open complex that I want
to<00:02:21.710> note<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.590> open<00:02:25.010> complex<00:02:26.680> once<00:02:27.680> that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
to note here the open complex once that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.040 
to note here the open complex once that
complex<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.310> stabilized<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.940> open<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.840> ready

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
complex is stabilized and open and ready

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.750 
complex is stabilized and open and ready
to<00:02:30.140> go

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to go

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.370 
to go
HB<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.940> E<00:02:32.270> those<00:02:32.630> three<00:02:32.840> transcription

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
HB and E those three transcription

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.380 
HB and E those three transcription
factors<00:02:33.770> leave<00:02:34.220> transcription<00:02:34.880> factors<00:02:35.180> to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
factors leave transcription factors to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
factors leave transcription factors to
HB<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.380> E<00:02:36.530> leave<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> complex<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:39.050> how<00:02:39.230> do<00:02:39.290> I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
HB and E leave the complex so how do I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.790 
HB and E leave the complex so how do I
remember<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.550> way<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.670> remember<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.030> is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.360 

gonna<00:02:45.800> get<00:02:45.950> rid<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.190> orange<00:02:46.610> there<00:02:46.959> so

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
gonna get rid of that orange there so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.400 
gonna get rid of that orange there so
after<00:02:49.370> joining<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> party<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.570> opening

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
after joining the party and opening

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.350 
after joining the party and opening
things<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.830> he<00:02:52.340> decides<00:02:52.670> he<00:02:52.760> no<00:02:52.850> longer<00:02:52.970> wants

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
things up he decides he no longer wants

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.970 
things up he decides he no longer wants
to<00:02:53.390> stay<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.230> he<00:02:55.870> be<00:02:57.220> exiting<00:02:58.630> he<00:02:59.630> leaves<00:02:59.900> H<00:03:00.290> B

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to stay so he be exiting he leaves H B

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.670 
to stay so he be exiting he leaves H B
and<00:03:01.250> E<00:03:01.489> leave<00:03:02.480> ok<00:03:03.470> here<00:03:04.660> HCFA<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.959> B<00:03:06.080> join<00:03:06.560> the

and E leave ok here HCFA and B join the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.640 
and E leave ok here HCFA and B join the
party<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.250> HB<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.000> E<00:03:08.209> he'd<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.930> exiting<00:03:09.380> they

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
party now HB and E he'd be exiting they

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.540 
party now HB and E he'd be exiting they
all<00:03:09.830> leave<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> party<00:03:10.520> ok<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.200> RNA<00:03:13.040> polymerase

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
all leave the party ok so RNA polymerase

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.120 
all leave the party ok so RNA polymerase
2<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:14.450> its<00:03:15.820> CTD<00:03:16.820> or<00:03:17.590> carboxy<00:03:18.590> terminal

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
2 then its CTD or carboxy terminal

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:30.310 
2 then its CTD or carboxy terminal
domain<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:27.340> phosphorylated<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> what<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
domain is phosphorylated so what is the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.220 
domain is phosphorylated so what is the
carboxy<00:03:30.980> terminal<00:03:31.519> domain<00:03:31.750> well<00:03:32.780> RNA

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
carboxy terminal domain well RNA

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.440 
carboxy terminal domain well RNA
polymerase<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> protein<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.340> proteins<00:03:35.239> are

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
polymerase is a protein and proteins are

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.570 
polymerase is a protein and proteins are
made<00:03:35.600> up<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:35.900> long<00:03:36.140> strings<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.830> amino<00:03:36.920> acids

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
made up of long strings of amino acids

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.150 
made up of long strings of amino acids
amino<00:03:38.390> amino<00:03:38.810> acid<00:03:39.110> chains<00:03:39.410> while<00:03:40.070> the

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
amino amino acid chains while the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.430 
amino amino acid chains while the
peptide<00:03:40.489> chains<00:03:40.820> have<00:03:41.269> amino<00:03:41.690> terminal<00:03:42.200> and

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
peptide chains have amino terminal and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.460 
peptide chains have amino terminal and
or<00:03:43.250> an<00:03:43.580> amino<00:03:43.850> terminus<00:03:44.269> rather<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
or an amino terminus rather and a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.140 
or an amino terminus rather and a
carboxy<00:03:45.950> terminus<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.549> it's<00:03:46.670> carboxy

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
carboxy terminus so it's carboxy

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.449 
carboxy terminus so it's carboxy
terminal<00:03:47.480> domain<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:48.019> phosphorylated<00:03:48.830> once

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
terminal domain is phosphorylated once

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.970 
terminal domain is phosphorylated once
that<00:03:49.610> happens<00:03:50.320> transcription<00:03:51.320> is<00:03:51.410> initiated

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
that happens transcription is initiated

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:01.509 
that happens transcription is initiated
it<00:03:52.070> can<00:03:52.220> go<00:03:56.950> so<00:03:57.950> transcription<00:03:58.580> begins<00:04:00.519> so

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
it can go so transcription begins so

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.380 
it can go so transcription begins so
then<00:04:01.700> what<00:04:01.880> happens

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
then what happens

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.740 
then what happens
so<00:04:03.430> transcription<00:04:04.430> factor<00:04:04.760> 2<00:04:05.000> -

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
so transcription factor 2 -

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.530 
so transcription factor 2 -
transcription<00:04:06.290> factors<00:04:06.620> DNA<00:04:07.220> stay<00:04:08.000> at<00:04:08.329> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
transcription factors DNA stay at the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:17.750 
transcription factors DNA stay at the
tata<00:04:08.750> box<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:17.030> way<00:04:17.180> i<00:04:17.209> remembered

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
tata box so the way i remembered

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.750 
tata box so the way i remembered
that<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.930> might<00:04:19.110> be<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.260> little<00:04:19.380> bit<00:04:19.530> silly

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
that is this might be a little bit silly

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.360 
that is this might be a little bit silly
but<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.820> think<00:04:21.090> da<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:22.140> stay<00:04:22.380> here<00:04:22.620> like<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.340> a

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
but I think da you stay here like in a

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.490 
but I think da you stay here like in a
sort<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.180> Arnold<00:04:24.660> Schwarzenegger<00:04:25.050> voice<00:04:25.320> I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
sort of Arnold Schwarzenegger voice I

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.570 
sort of Arnold Schwarzenegger voice I
just<00:04:25.530> think<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:25.950> Terminator<00:04:26.370> what<00:04:26.550> I

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
just think of the Terminator what I

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.300 
just think of the Terminator what I
think<00:04:26.820> about<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.240> step<00:04:27.480> here<00:04:27.780> against<00:04:28.620> super

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
think about this step here against super

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.490 
think about this step here against super
silly<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:30.240> if<00:04:30.420> that's<00:04:30.720> help<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.230> helps<00:04:31.410> me

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
silly but if that's help that helps me

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.780 
silly but if that's help that helps me
remember<00:04:31.710> hopefully<00:04:32.220> that's<00:04:32.430> silly<00:04:32.610> jelly

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
remember hopefully that's silly jelly

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.740 
remember hopefully that's silly jelly
cups<00:04:32.970> meet<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.330> too

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
cups meet you too

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.370 
cups meet you too
so<00:04:34.530> transcription<00:04:35.460> factors<00:04:35.730> 2d<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.990> both

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
so transcription factors 2d and a both

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.100 
so transcription factors 2d and a both
stay<00:04:37.680> at<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.860> tata<00:04:38.070> box<00:04:38.310> then<00:04:39.180> RNA<00:04:39.690> polymerase

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
stay at the tata box then RNA polymerase

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.230 
stay at the tata box then RNA polymerase

that's<00:05:02.730> pretty<00:05:02.940> much<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.240> as<00:05:03.420> far<00:05:03.480> as

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
that's pretty much it as far as
