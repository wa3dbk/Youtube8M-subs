00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
probably one part per 10,000 parts of

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.810 
probably one part per 10,000 parts of
organic<00:05:32.020> know<00:05:32.200> right<00:05:32.680> so<00:05:32.980> it's<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.280> dispersed

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
organic know right so it's so dispersed

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.390 
organic know right so it's so dispersed
it's<00:05:34.120> escalas<00:05:34.420> the<00:05:34.540> odor<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.950> order<00:05:36.220> here

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
it's escalas the odor is to order here

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.130 
it's escalas the odor is to order here
because<00:05:36.700> as<00:05:36.850> manure<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:37.540> spread<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:37.960> house

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
because as manure is so spread a house

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.200 
because as manure is so spread a house
right<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:38.920> can't<00:05:39.160> concentrate<00:05:39.550> where<00:05:39.940> are<00:05:40.000> you

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
right it can't concentrate where are you

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.540 
right it can't concentrate where are you
and<00:05:40.510> so<00:05:40.660> there's<00:05:40.870> no<00:05:41.020> heat<00:05:41.050> there's<00:05:41.920> no<00:05:42.070> issues

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
and so there's no heat there's no issues

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.180 
and so there's no heat there's no issues
in<00:05:42.850> this<00:05:43.210> kind<00:05:43.420> of<00:05:43.480> discipline<00:05:44.440> because<00:05:45.010> it's
