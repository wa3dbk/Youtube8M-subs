 surprise what a surprise if you said the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.600
 last week 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.550
 we are not crying is that we have the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.809
 sun and crying for the sun is because 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.759
 we have the sun giving us in the face 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 then and there are cars and dogs 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 what time so be careful because there are 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.650
 so natural images of us that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.090
