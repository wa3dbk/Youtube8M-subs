first<00:00:57.250> we'll<00:00:57.490> heat<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.910> broad<00:00:58.240> non-stick<00:00:58.510> pan

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
first we'll heat a broad non-stick pan

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.960 
first we'll heat a broad non-stick pan
add<00:00:59.670> little<00:01:00.670> ghee<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:03.370> not<00:01:03.400> let<00:01:03.820> the
