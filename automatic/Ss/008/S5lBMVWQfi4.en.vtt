00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello here at hoh we welcome 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.120
 have now expanded our studio something 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.120
 we now have a macbook air 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.990
 Now I'm here to install albert 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.949
 and I'm a stupid yes not so 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.949
 that we no time he was a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.100
 cd drive fitted or i have 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.270
 no idea 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 Of course, the whole thing has the drive 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.940
 There is simply no room for it and if you are 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.309
 Honestly we still need it today 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 So who really needs today 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.489
 still effectively a cd drive in the computer 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.020
 So the experiences I made 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.760
 have is almost like almost 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.080
 Floppy yes still until three for the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 have been in some kombi then in there 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.350
 you really need so seldom that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.180
 it is not really worth it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.270
 just so at least in portable 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.729
 devices I think we have 8 16 today 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.520
 gb usb sticks because no film on it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.290
 I can put my mother on it 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.580
 Of course the invitation card is what 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.130
 I come for a rubbish need the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.400
 thing every day but I think the tenor 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.650
 is actually pauli agree the place 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.549
 none save especially with this one 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.689
 small netbooks laptops netbooks like 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.140
 whatever you want to call it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.100
 notebooks micro buchs what do i know what 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.409
 but we do not need them at all 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.649
 drive but now I have one 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.110
 software iwork and there is of course one 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.460
 cd in it so in the case dvd shit 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 how can I get them now? 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.829
 now 3 how do i get the programs from 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.170
 iwork on my macbook on it how 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.450
 that's exactly what we want in this 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.129
 I will discuss tutorial today 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 Show you how I feel about my imac 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.680
 and the mac 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.530
 if he can adjust that for me 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.160
 practically access this dvd directly 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 can 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.300
 There is an installation in the case 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.140
 installation is thick apple deliver there 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.760
 no more dvd plastic here is there 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.290
 practically everything on it what I need 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.239
 and of course there are windows too 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 the release of apple 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.349
 that means that I have a drive 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.300
 practically directly so can release that 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.069
 I could use it under macos iks 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.260
 you can download both places 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.260
 so okay let's start now 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.030
 We start on the imac at the first 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.910
 imac it's the important me first 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.420
 Here is my work here and now 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.060
 I would like to install this dvd this 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.940
 I would like to share dvd 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.730
 this works like this i go in 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.030
 the apple so the apple logo g on 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.730
 system settings and there I find 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.810
 the folder under internet and wireless 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.040
 communication release 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.829
 there I have the dvd or cd release 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.870
 and I have to turn it on then can 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.480
 I ask as an option 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.280
 before using another dvd drive 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.600
 can 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.400
 so if somebody's suddenly on it 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.410
 access was released 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.790
 then he says to me hey respect the will 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.720
 someone access your dvd drive 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:46.340
 Do you want to allow the word a question 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.870
 the imagine itself must want 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.930
 I do not want that, I do not have to 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.660
 I do not have to do that , you have that example 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.790
 now the imac up in the office and sitting 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.940
 down in the living room and would often times 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.799
 to access a graphic dvd with clips 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.989
 for example, then it would be very 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.090
 arduous if you ask of course 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.310
 would have to be on a mac if there someone on 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.959
 can access because then you have to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.359
 you have to save up again on hunting 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.269
 rather, click someone with it 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.639
 actually allowed to access 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.959
 that means actually 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.120
 I do not need me at first 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.130
 only in the house of access 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.230
 would like the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.710
 That's why I want to install 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.170
 do not ask so that whole close 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.150
 now this is already set 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.860
 so now we come to the next part 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.470
 Now we have to on our macbook air 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.240
 go 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.430
 that now turn on is one 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.410
 by the way, a small premiere for us 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.140
 we have two macs with him 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.650
 simultaneously record the desktop and 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.830
 the camera my colleague already 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.590
 Incidentally, I also sweat 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.810
 we have the things that come here 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.860
 what do we have to do we go into the 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:05.510
 enemies and see there directly removed 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:09.140
 cd dvd and he tells me on the imac 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:13.340
 i7 is actually released something 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:16.520
 and here is the work 09 install dvd 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.430
 at that time , double-click and guess 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.910
 the picture that you still before my imac 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:26.420
 you should know so jobs is wants 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.880
 Here, too 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.190
 Jesus I do the same now 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.930
 view everything clearly here is exactly 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.690
 the same same syllable in the picture 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.910
 say like on my other imac 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.340
 I can now quite normal 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.700
 access as if this is actual 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.400
 drive would be something on mine 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.580
 macbook air or in my macbook air 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.120
 The drive is complete 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.460
 released in the case here would be so 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.010
 i would mean one on my imac 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.500
 dvd blank insert or cd blank 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.180
 I could go directly from here too 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.680
 to burn data 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.420
 okay that's it look I've got 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.280
 hopefully you can show how to 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.080
 quite simply a drive for his 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.120
 macbook air can release on his 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.280
 that would also work under windows 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.710
 Apple will do that for you 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.990
 software 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.580
 look if I still find one in the 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.000
 video description as link purely 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.729
 otherwise apple.com there you can do that 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.900
 just search and find 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.460
 I hope it was interesting for you 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.540
