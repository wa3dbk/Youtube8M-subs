everything back to normal so I think
it's<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.060> pretty<00:02:06.209> ingenious<00:02:06.719> idea<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> add<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it's a pretty ingenious idea to add to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
cameras now both of these iphone models

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.100 
cameras now both of these iphone models
will<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.120> rocking<00:02:12.330> an<00:02:12.630> 8-megapixel

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.230 
will be rocking an 8-megapixel
rear-facing<00:02:13.770> camera<00:02:14.490> now<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.090> sounds

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
rear-facing camera now that sounds

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.300 
rear-facing camera now that sounds
familiar<00:02:15.510> that's<00:02:15.900> because<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.410> iphone<00:02:16.830> 5s

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
familiar that's because the iphone 5s

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.030 
familiar that's because the iphone 5s
also<00:02:17.819> has<00:02:18.000> an<00:02:18.150> 8<00:02:18.270> megapixel<00:02:18.480> camera<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.709> Apple

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
also has an 8 megapixel camera but Apple

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.070 
also has an 8 megapixel camera but Apple
has<00:02:20.220> put<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.700> brand<00:02:21.030> new<00:02:21.150> sensor<00:02:21.599> inside<00:02:21.900> of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
has put a brand new sensor inside of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.000 
has put a brand new sensor inside of
here<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.409> it's<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.680> be<00:02:22.769> better

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
here so it's going to be better

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.920 
here so it's going to be better
low-light<00:02:23.280> performance<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:24.360> also<00:02:24.569> they<00:02:24.810> have

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
low-light performance and also they have

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.630 
low-light performance and also they have
these<00:02:25.110> new<00:02:25.349> things<00:02:25.379> called<00:02:25.890> focus

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
these new things called focus

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.130 
these new things called focus
souls<00:02:26.910> which<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:27.420> written<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.870> all<00:02:27.900> this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140

about<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.760> iphone<00:02:42.120> 5s<00:02:42.569> last<00:02:42.870> year<00:02:43.110> was<00:02:43.320> slow

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
about the iphone 5s last year was slow

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.830 
about the iphone 5s last year was slow
mo<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.280> slow<00:02:44.550> mo<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:45.180> all<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.690> way

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
mo but now slow mo is going all the way

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.430 
mo but now slow mo is going all the way
up<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.340> 240<00:02:47.340> frames<00:02:47.850> per<00:02:48.300> second<00:02:48.750> up<00:02:48.959> from<00:02:49.320> the
