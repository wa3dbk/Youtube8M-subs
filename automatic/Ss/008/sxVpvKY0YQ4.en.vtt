00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.360

 All right, nope , no movement. 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:28.870
 Let's just go back rambling and codes 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.400
 and pain and disgust for training 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.900
 according to pedro, this is the best 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:42.739
 way to end the terror of opossum 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:46.010
 class tomato juice will snack everything 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.549
 right at the time of the campaign dinner in 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.549
 back of the campfire 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.709

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.400
 if we had advanced first 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.409
 as I wanted the darci would not have stayed 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.159

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.769

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.209
 I regretted not being able to enjoy the original 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.560
 stated that girls opossum is not 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.650
 no one's fault 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.650
 the autopsy on the player but we can still 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:32.599
 we had fun not staying with the cookie 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:40.639
 tooth for a long time but it's worth it 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:40.639
 do more in the most beautiful slippers 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.859
 of music history 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.260
 we do not have a fire but I think we can 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:56.010
 stay around the microwave what is 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:58.639
 we have nice fire pit 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.949
 someone wants to have something at the time 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:04.519
 This one does not know can sing or not 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.519

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.599
 Too bad the rain ruined our 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.699
 little step I'll pack up and this 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.919
 I hope the tensions snow the people to 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.610
 Our biggest bike ride was 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.469

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.229

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.750
 Fun is you have a fish dog 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.509
 so it looks like we're staying 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.729
 I think the only thing we can not 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:03.710
 to do is sleep with the stars 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.710

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.220
