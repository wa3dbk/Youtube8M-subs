 only 30 minutes of quito 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 there is confusion only with 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.270
 e way 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.450
 in the game 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 we try to impose 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.650
 natural giselle and yes my life 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
 a lake surrounded by mountains with its clubs 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.239
 this is the second year that you saw as well as all those with greater options 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.980
 PRIÃ­stas is a very simple attitude 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.369
 lisicki the cyclist if they replaced with her 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.460
 bangkok for being an event like this 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840
 this occasion classic 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 in this way the exercise 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 and is that the dt the dancing 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.110
 In 2002 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.400
 among others 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 as a holder 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
 However 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.100
 we are in the old neighborhood with pasta acosta payment this welcome home 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.360
 and is that the international 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.440
 who is part of the group of architects and who conceived 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.420
 built this the famous place museum as you can describe old havana 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.860
 - good washington 7 oct 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.589
 we have not dedicated to the field 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.419
 the grant vernacular resources five natural materials materialize 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.789
 you are made up of two with friends and me 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:16.869
 cnn 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.549
 it's a crime 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.329
 puyol lied 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.019
 tactically he formed one after seeing work with us for nations 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.299
 united in the reconstruction of peasant housing 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.099
 in united commissions we had one for this since 91 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.249
 we identify with flavor of the earth 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.359
 we wanted 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.359
 Japan ignorance or construction 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.810
 villegas has granted this achieve so magical and that should because 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.560
 you can really breathe fresh air an excellent climate efe is surrounded by 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.709
 nature of green 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.709
 these houses with these natural materials 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:06.780
 comments in detail 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.539
 the conception since this place 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.209
 the afternoon of tuesday 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.209
 in tune with his are only john mctiernan 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.569
 g 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.719
 in the game 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.749
 we try not 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.639
 buildings 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.249
 a philosophical part a part by belief threat of eta 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.199
 uses materials that are so close at hand and that we can bump into two 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.599
 plant type 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.199
 that in other countries like colombia same month we were very used then 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.279
 Here we are with 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:39.709
 to us not 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.609
 jalapa see what a resistant 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.649
 but we have the idea 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.470
 which are materials that are used in buildings 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.449
 of action but maybe 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.000
 as expected again m 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.969
 I thought about this type of material 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.979
 much is expected n 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.559
 I remember when they were not wanted in the technique of reinforced concrete 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.879
 we lost that credibility in this type of construction 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.169
 but it's not in other countries has done research with this material are 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.619
 more resistant in case of earthquakes at least 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.659
 in one the act to the attorney general 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.779
 they are not the same conditions as before 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.909
 we take two styles we take the two 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:18.769
 with materials 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.999
 the next technically improved for jesus curl 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.809
 replace the earthquakes 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:27.519
 it has to be within a current spell because its example windows 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:30.639
 formerly for the fact of not being able to make bigger events 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.680
 the houses of the cold muscles 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 the other continents we can improve the car 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.169
 those who know great assets the steps of consumption 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.569
 warm illuminated 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.419
 if you like the hunger strike 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.310
 here we not only appreciate 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.920
 this type of space but also every house is designed 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.920
 according to the needs of its inhabitants 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.309
 what are the advantages of this type of construction 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:05.159
 suddenly a voice 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.590
 basically two or three important stakes that we have 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.059
 differences with two pieces of their chips 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:13.430
 they generate effects in the press 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.430
 while at a house you are 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.749
 a natural part for another part 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.249
 the forms that 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:25.259
 we see here it's like a shock like it works with play dough 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.029
 this important for us that the house 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.209
 do not have corners do not have tracks that are rounded 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.720
 because if it persists we think that man is the only square animal 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.779
 in the closing he likes to live in drawers 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.999
 what does not seem to have assumed a square cave of the solar reserve covers it by 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.069
 hundred 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.330
 I hope we have other efe 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.699
 the 200 houses 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
 and little that is natural both juncker and 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.650
 Another advantage is climate 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.550
 the main advantage 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.469
 of the houses body 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.300
 they are offered hot 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.749
 while almost always 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.019
 it was played well located on the outskirts of each other you feel 3 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.919
 and at dawn, I count a lot of cold between appointments 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.779
 besides this sector 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.779
 and that helps the part 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.139
 p that the house has movements that the patient is left without this 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.550
 Ricky is indisputable around the house of all spaces 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.520
 we are really serious 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.599
 p the dining room and the 3 2 million cfen 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.990
 It was designed with cape 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.529
 before the outside share 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:43.529
 and that every 100 is discussed what 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.909
 points of the municipality the use of color the same as in which we will win 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.469
 inquire in colon 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.719
 But that's a 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.169
 a very interesting subject 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.559
 the one that has to be handled with tweezers because 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:59.559
 the color that no civil 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.680
 I will go thank you very much payments here we continue to enjoy 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.410
 of extermino his place will remain open and the moment we continue with more of home and 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.029
 is that the international Ecuador
