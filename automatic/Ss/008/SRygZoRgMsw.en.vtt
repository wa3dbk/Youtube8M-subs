00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
beta but again this is too awesome I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.019 
beta but again this is too awesome I
just<00:00:15.480> realized<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.139> lost<00:00:16.560> five<00:00:17.130> battle<00:00:17.699> energy

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
just realized I lost five battle energy

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.330 
just realized I lost five battle energy
from<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.920> match

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
from that match

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.609 
from that match
apparently<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.900> stinks<00:00:22.289> each<00:00:22.380> male

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
apparently so that stinks each male

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
apparently so that stinks each male
takes<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:23.070> five<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.240> only<00:00:24.330> do

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
takes out five so I can really only do

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.380 
takes out five so I can really only do
like<00:00:24.779> 12<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.650> row<00:00:25.800> then<00:00:26.099> maybe<00:00:26.369> enough<00:00:27.180> from

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
like 12 in a row then maybe enough from

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.000 
like 12 in a row then maybe enough from
like<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> energy<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.140> guess<00:00:28.500> that's<00:00:28.740> kind<00:00:28.949> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
like the energy I guess that's kind of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.569 
like the energy I guess that's kind of
them<00:00:29.340> saying<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.880> us<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.070> take<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.399> break

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
them saying to us you know take a break

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
them saying to us you know take a break
go<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.850> science<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.420> stuff<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.110> also

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
go out science do stuff but that also

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.139 
go out science do stuff but that also
