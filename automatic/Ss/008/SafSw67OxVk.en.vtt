look<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.140> where<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> dust<00:02:13.800> area<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:14.850> in

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
look for where the dust area is so in

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.930 
look for where the dust area is so in
this<00:02:15.030> case<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.690> airbag<00:02:16.110> bit<00:02:16.440> there

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this case it's on the airbag bit there

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.000 
this case it's on the airbag bit there
just<00:02:17.940> simply<00:02:19.790> get<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> good<00:02:21.030> clean<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.860> then

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
just simply get a good clean and then

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.530 
just simply get a good clean and then
the<00:02:23.130> dust<00:02:23.340> will<00:02:23.490> be<00:02:23.580> gone<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.330> same

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the dust will be gone it's the same

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.820 
the dust will be gone it's the same
we've<00:02:24.720> solved<00:02:24.960> right<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> detailed<00:02:25.620> areas

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
we've solved right the detailed areas

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.950 
we've solved right the detailed areas
down<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.490> there<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.660> see<00:02:27.780> on

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
down the bottom there as you can see on

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.130 
down the bottom there as you can see on
the<00:02:28.080> engine<00:02:28.440> bay<00:02:28.650> they're<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:29.960> clean<00:02:30.960> around

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the engine bay they're just clean around

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.730 
the engine bay they're just clean around
the<00:02:31.260> pipes<00:02:31.620> alone<00:02:35.390> there<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.660> much<00:02:37.320> cleaner

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the pipes alone there we go much cleaner

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.950 
the pipes alone there we go much cleaner
and<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:39.030> other<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.420> words<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> fact

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
and the other thing is words the fact

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.020 
and the other thing is words the fact
that<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.650> won't<00:02:40.920> damage<00:02:41.160> your<00:02:41.310> Hot<00:02:41.550> Wheels<00:02:41.760> car

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that it won't damage your Hot Wheels car

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.910 
that it won't damage your Hot Wheels car
because<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.050> you're<00:02:43.200> doing<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.560> pretty<00:02:43.770> much

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
because all you're doing is pretty much

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.830 
because all you're doing is pretty much
just<00:02:44.100> clearing<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.610> dust<00:02:44.940> that's<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.390> top<00:02:45.660> of

stick them on eBay sell them and it's

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.040 
stick them on eBay sell them and it's

must-see they were again mud dirt milk

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.899 
must-see they were again mud dirt milk
and<00:05:36.599> general<00:05:37.199> stains<00:05:37.529> are<00:05:37.800> impossible<00:05:38.159> to

clean in warm water and why is that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.439 
clean in warm water and why is that
because<00:05:42.750> cars<00:05:43.409> will<00:05:43.889> rust<00:05:44.460> or<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.909> paint<00:05:45.210> will

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
because cars will rust or the paint will

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.019 
because cars will rust or the paint will

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
start to peel off again it has happened

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.629 
start to peel off again it has happened
if<00:05:48.479> you<00:05:49.020> do<00:05:49.169> actually<00:05:49.740> leave<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.159> Hot<00:05:50.430> Wheels

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
if you do actually leave a Hot Wheels

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.510 
if you do actually leave a Hot Wheels
car<00:05:50.819> in<00:05:51.000> water<00:05:51.240> if<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:52.289> live<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.770> hard<00:05:53.190> water

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
car in water if you live in hard water

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.850 
car in water if you live in hard water
area<00:05:53.729> which<00:05:54.330> is<00:05:54.479> where<00:05:54.599> limescale<00:05:55.169> builds<00:05:55.710> up

area which is where limescale builds up

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.980 
area which is where limescale builds up
then<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.639> axle<00:05:57.000> will<00:05:57.180> rust<00:05:57.449> and<00:05:57.719> you<00:05:57.779> also

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
then the axle will rust and you also

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.899 
then the axle will rust and you also
have<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.259> white<00:05:58.529> powdery<00:05:59.190> substance<00:05:59.400> site

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
have a white powdery substance site

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.490 
have a white powdery substance site
which<00:06:00.539> will<00:06:00.719> just<00:06:00.870> solve<00:06:01.050> right<00:06:01.199> be<00:06:01.379> the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
which will just solve right be the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.249 
which will just solve right be the
remnants<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.849> hard<00:06:03.060> water<00:06:03.240> can<00:06:04.169> also

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
remnants of the hard water can also

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.469 
remnants of the hard water can also
damage<00:06:04.770> your<00:06:04.949> car<00:06:05.279> as<00:06:05.490> well<00:06:05.520> as<00:06:06.210> again<00:06:06.449> you

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
damage your car as well as again you

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.570 
damage your car as well as again you
know<00:06:06.659> exactly<00:06:07.050> what<00:06:07.229> your<00:06:07.409> axles<00:06:08.039> rusting<00:06:08.460> up

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
know exactly what your axles rusting up

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.309 
know exactly what your axles rusting up
and<00:06:08.759> then<00:06:08.849> it's<00:06:08.940> alright<00:06:09.180> pushing<00:06:09.479> it<00:06:09.569> down<00:06:09.750> so

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
and then it's alright pushing it down so

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.930 
and then it's alright pushing it down so
I<00:06:10.349> could<00:06:10.500> smoke<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:11.069> it<00:06:11.129> stops<00:06:11.490> Midway

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
I could smoke and it stops Midway

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.140 
I could smoke and it stops Midway
because<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.270> axles<00:06:12.599> can't<00:06:12.840> turn<00:06:13.969> so<00:06:14.969> again

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
because the axles can't turn so again

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.839 
because the axles can't turn so again

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
now if this holds for four to

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.310 
now if this holds for four to
it's<00:06:37.770> actually<00:06:38.130> had<00:06:38.280> a<00:06:38.490> lot<00:06:38.670> of<00:06:38.850> milk<00:06:39.660> staining

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
it's actually had a lot of milk staining

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.310 
it's actually had a lot of milk staining
on<00:06:40.770> this<00:06:41.070> little<00:06:41.340> bit<00:06:41.460> here<00:06:41.490> so<00:06:42.120> it<00:06:43.050> was<00:06:43.140> a<00:06:43.170> case

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
on this little bit here so it was a case

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.300 
on this little bit here so it was a case
of<00:06:43.530> simply<00:06:43.830> clean<00:06:44.340> that<00:06:44.520> off<00:06:44.670> and<00:06:45.150> look<00:06:45.270> it<00:06:45.390> now

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310

it's<00:06:47.310> all<00:06:47.430> clean<00:06:47.700> a<00:06:48.000> bit<00:06:48.960> that<00:06:49.500> might<00:06:49.770> not<00:06:49.980> come

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
it's all clean a bit that might not come

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.640 
it's all clean a bit that might not come
up<00:06:50.190> very<00:06:50.460> well<00:06:50.520> is<00:06:51.000> sort<00:06:51.810> of<00:06:51.900> like<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.500> air

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
up very well is sort of like the air

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.710 
up very well is sort of like the air
front<00:06:53.250> light<00:06:53.460> bit<00:06:53.730> again<00:06:54.300> like<00:06:54.450> I<00:06:54.480> say

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
front light bit again like I say

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.510 
front light bit again like I say
customizing<00:06:55.530> year<00:06:55.710> to<00:06:55.950> brush<00:06:56.250> you<00:06:56.370> could

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
customizing year to brush you could

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.490 
customizing year to brush you could
probably<00:06:56.700> get<00:06:57.510> that<00:06:57.660> in<00:06:57.780> there<00:06:57.990> or<00:06:58.140> even

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
probably get that in there or even

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.990 
probably get that in there or even
before<00:06:58.800> you<00:06:58.950> get<00:06:59.070> some<00:06:59.310> polishing<00:06:59.730> tools

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
before you get some polishing tools

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.390 
before you get some polishing tools
again<00:07:00.720> there<00:07:00.930> are<00:07:01.080> power<00:07:01.380> tools<00:07:01.890> for<00:07:02.190> little

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
again there are power tools for little

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.220 
again there are power tools for little
tiny<00:07:02.790> things<00:07:03.360> that<00:07:03.480> you<00:07:03.690> probably<00:07:03.870> do<00:07:04.110> of

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
tiny things that you probably do of

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.250 
tiny things that you probably do of
customizing<00:07:04.980> be<00:07:05.640> careful<00:07:06.450> because<00:07:06.600> the<00:07:06.930> power

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
customizing be careful because the power

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.770 
customizing be careful because the power
might<00:07:08.070> remove<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:08.610> paintwork<00:07:09.030> or<00:07:09.390> possibly

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
might remove the paintwork or possibly

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.020 
might remove the paintwork or possibly
the<00:07:09.930> chrome<00:07:10.200> you<00:07:10.710> don't<00:07:11.130> really<00:07:11.460> want<00:07:11.760> to<00:07:11.790> do

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
the chrome you don't really want to do

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.520 
the chrome you don't really want to do
that's<00:07:12.300> removing<00:07:13.020> the<00:07:13.080> chrome<00:07:13.380> or<00:07:13.500> paintwork

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
that's removing the chrome or paintwork

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.050 
that's removing the chrome or paintwork
and<00:07:16.530> I<00:07:16.710> hope<00:07:16.920> this<00:07:17.070> has<00:07:17.220> helped<00:07:17.610> because<00:07:17.880> if

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
and I hope this has helped because if

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.630 
and I hope this has helped because if

you do get a load of secondary cars that

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.600 
you do get a load of secondary cars that
are<00:07:20.730> dirty<00:07:21.210> or<00:07:21.240> need<00:07:22.110> a<00:07:22.140> bit<00:07:22.350> cleaning<00:07:22.950> or<00:07:23.100> some

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
we're just basically not very

we're just basically not very

solved like a toothbrush rather than a
