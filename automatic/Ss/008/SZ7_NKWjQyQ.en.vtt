00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
my handy when it comes to curves you got

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.130 
my handy when it comes to curves you got
to<00:00:04.890> start<00:00:05.160> being<00:00:05.759> creative<00:00:06.060> like<00:00:06.509> right<00:00:06.750> here

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to start being creative like right here

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.259 
to start being creative like right here
I've<00:00:07.410> got<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:08.660> can't<00:00:09.660> use<00:00:10.349> these

well maybe I can i push it as far as I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.349 
well maybe I can i push it as far as I
can<00:00:14.340> set<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> down<00:00:16.190> now<00:00:17.190> here<00:00:17.640> I'm<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.240> gonna

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
can set it down now here I'm just gonna

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.650 
can set it down now here I'm just gonna
go<00:00:18.630> ahead<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:20.630> use<00:00:25.670> these<00:00:26.670> pins<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.269> hold<00:00:27.449> us

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
go ahead and use these pins to hold us

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.980 
go ahead and use these pins to hold us
down<00:00:28.340> actually<00:00:29.340> cuz<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> just

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990

yeah yeah that'll work
I'll<00:01:25.920> weight<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.580> that'll<00:01:26.909> hold<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
I'll weight it down that'll hold it in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.330 
I'll weight it down that'll hold it in
place<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:30.200> last

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
place and as you can see here last

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
place and as you can see here last
couple<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.400> inches<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.420> pins

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
couple of inches I just have these pins

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.740 
couple of inches I just have these pins
holding<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> make<00:01:36.090> sure<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
holding it down I want to make sure that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.830 
holding it down I want to make sure that
this<00:01:36.930> doesn't<00:01:37.590> kink<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.820> way<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.119> I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this doesn't kink out that way so I'm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.410 
this doesn't kink out that way so I'm
just<00:01:40.020> using<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.439> pins<00:01:40.909> set<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.090> place<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.390> can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just using these pins set in place I can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
just using these pins set in place I can
also<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.439> also<00:01:43.560> probably<00:01:43.979> put<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> weight<00:01:44.369> in

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
also I can also probably put a weight in

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.200 
also I can also probably put a weight in
there<00:01:44.700> too<00:01:45.590> let<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:46.860> ahead<00:01:47.009> let<00:01:48.000> me<00:01:48.090> go

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
there too let me go ahead let me go

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.870 
there too let me go ahead let me go
ahead<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> look<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
ahead and take a look and see this is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.770 
ahead and take a look and see this is
coming<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.030> straight<00:01:56.720> yeah<00:01:58.040> here<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> need<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
coming out straight yeah here I need to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
coming out straight yeah here I need to
manipulate<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.200> curve<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.680> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:02.090> in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
manipulate the curve a little bit in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.469 
manipulate the curve a little bit in
there<00:02:03.500> put<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.250> make<00:02:05.910> sure<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.270> comes

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
there put one here make sure it comes

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.380 
there put one here make sure it comes
out<00:02:06.660> fairly<00:02:06.990> centered<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:09.030> looking

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
out fairly centered and that's looking

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.220 
out fairly centered and that's looking
good<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.630> me<00:02:12.690> close<00:02:12.990> up<00:02:15.830> how<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> did<00:02:17.160> that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
good and get me close up how I did that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.020 
good and get me close up how I did that
just<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.410> hold<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.740> in<00:02:19.800> place<00:02:20.010> cuz<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.550> want<00:02:20.790> this

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
just to hold it in place cuz I want this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.530 
just to hold it in place cuz I want this
end<00:02:21.590> piece<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.070> come<00:02:23.750> out<00:02:24.750> straight<00:02:26.540> so

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
end piece here to come out straight so

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.260 
end piece here to come out straight so
and<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.290> curve<00:02:28.560> by<00:02:29.130> any<00:02:29.340> chance<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:33.000> curve

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
and this curve by any chance this curve

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.740 
and this curve by any chance this curve
right<00:02:33.480> here<00:02:33.540> doesn't<00:02:34.080> use<00:02:35.420> keep<00:02:36.420> wanting<00:02:36.660> to

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
right here doesn't use keep wanting to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.820 
right here doesn't use keep wanting to
use<00:02:36.870> certain<00:02:37.170> term<00:02:37.350> superelevation<00:02:38.340> now

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
use certain term superelevation now

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.229 
use certain term superelevation now
donut<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.010> can't<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> term<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:42.209> it

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
donut I can't think of the term for it

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.970 
donut I can't think of the term for it
easements<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.230> curve<00:02:43.470> doesn't<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.860> any

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
easements this curve doesn't have any

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.210 
easements this curve doesn't have any
easements<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.550> just<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.790> straight<00:02:45.030> curve<00:02:45.300> so

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
easements it's just a straight curve so

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.820 
easements it's just a straight curve so
you<00:02:47.220> already<00:02:47.850> have<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.090> evenings<00:02:48.830> planned

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
you already have your evenings planned
