and<00:00:13.420> the<00:00:14.170> first<00:00:14.380> step<00:00:14.590> is<00:00:14.800> to<00:00:14.980> measure<00:00:15.160> the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
and the first step is to measure the

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.490 
and the first step is to measure the
posts<00:00:15.880> here<00:00:16.540> we<00:00:16.720> have<00:00:16.840> six<00:00:17.140> and<00:00:17.260> three

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
posts here we have six and three

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.820 
posts here we have six and three
quarters<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:18.700> the<00:00:18.760> outside<00:00:19.240> to<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:20.260> inside<00:00:20.350> we

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
quarters to the outside to the inside we

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.130 
quarters to the outside to the inside we
have<00:00:21.010> five<00:00:21.340> and<00:00:21.580> three<00:00:21.820> quarters<00:00:22.210> which<00:00:22.869> gives

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
have five and three quarters which gives

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.080 
have five and three quarters which gives
us<00:00:23.259> a<00:00:23.410> total<00:00:23.590> of<00:00:23.860> spacing<00:00:24.369> of<00:00:24.520> an<00:00:24.640> inch<00:00:24.820> for<00:00:25.029> the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
us a total of spacing of an inch for the

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
us a total of spacing of an inch for the
posts<00:00:25.599> and<00:00:25.779> half<00:00:26.500> an<00:00:26.680> inch<00:00:26.860> per<00:00:26.920> posts

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

the<00:03:23.130> cigarette<00:03:23.460> lighter<00:03:23.670> plug<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.510> comes

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the cigarette lighter plug that comes

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.930 
the cigarette lighter plug that comes
with<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.230> units<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.980> make<00:03:26.160> for<00:03:26.340> an<00:03:26.400> easy<00:03:26.580> easy

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
with the units to make for an easy easy

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.459 
with the units to make for an easy easy
install

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:33.469 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.720 

so<00:03:34.469> here<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.890> need<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.159> actually<00:03:35.280> run<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
so here we need to actually run the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.309 
so here we need to actually run the
wires<00:03:35.909> through<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> seat<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.019> we<00:03:37.170> do

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
wires through the seat and the way we do

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.410 
wires through the seat and the way we do
that<00:03:37.469> is<00:03:37.530> by<00:03:37.799> simply<00:03:38.189> unclipping<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:39.000> by

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
that is by simply unclipping this by

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.360 
that is by simply unclipping this by
lifting<00:03:39.659> up<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.409> flimsy<00:03:41.219> plastic

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
lifting up on this little flimsy plastic

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.449 
lifting up on this little flimsy plastic
and<00:03:41.909> simply<00:03:42.540> pulling<00:03:42.840> back<00:03:43.109> all<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.500> way<00:03:43.530> here

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
and simply pulling back all the way here

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.000 
and simply pulling back all the way here
we<00:03:44.609> have<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.879> entire<00:03:45.180> seat<00:03:45.510> exposed<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.319> if

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
we have the entire seat exposed and if

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.589 
we have the entire seat exposed and if
you<00:03:47.189> put<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.519> finger<00:03:47.819> through<00:03:48.000> here<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.450> can

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
you put your finger through here you can

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.449 
you put your finger through here you can
feel<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> hole<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.500> I'll<00:03:49.590> demonstrate<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:50.129> by

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
feel a hole and I'll demonstrate that by

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.309 
feel a hole and I'll demonstrate that by
actually<00:03:51.090> slowly<00:03:51.840> sliding<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
actually slowly sliding a

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.140 
actually slowly sliding a
screwdriver<00:03:52.650> through<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.670> can<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:53.849> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
screwdriver through and you can see the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.699 
screwdriver through and you can see the
blade<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.629> screwdriver<00:03:54.900> does<00:03:55.409> come

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
blade of the screwdriver does come

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.830 
blade of the screwdriver does come
through<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.879> now<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.209> we're<00:03:57.359> going<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.719> is

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
through so now what we're going to do is

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.879 
through so now what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:57.959> actually<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.379> run<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.680> wiring

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
we're actually going to run the wiring

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.289 
we're actually going to run the wiring
we<00:03:59.069> have<00:03:59.219> to<00:03:59.340> put<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.609> underneath<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.969> metal

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
we have to put it underneath the metal

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.449 
we have to put it underneath the metal
of<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.569> seat<00:04:00.810> here<00:04:01.109> by<00:04:01.620> simply<00:04:01.889> coming<00:04:02.310> out

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
of the seat here by simply coming out

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.809 
of the seat here by simply coming out
just<00:04:03.359> like<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.519> then<00:04:05.519> we're<00:04:05.639> going<00:04:05.730> to

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
just like this and then we're going to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.970 
just like this and then we're going to
slowly<00:04:06.209> put<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:06.720> wire<00:04:06.900> through<00:04:06.930> make<00:04:07.799> sure

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
slowly put the wire through make sure

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.819 
slowly put the wire through make sure
not<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.189> bend<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.669> too<00:04:08.819> tough<00:04:09.060> too<00:04:09.299> much<00:04:09.829> and

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
not to bend it too tough too much and

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.490 
not to bend it too tough too much and
then<00:04:11.099> we<00:04:11.189> pass<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.430> wire<00:04:11.760> through<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:13.290> now<00:04:13.439> we

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
then we pass the wire through and now we

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.500 
then we pass the wire through and now we
have<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> wire<00:04:13.980> through<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.370> hole<00:04:14.489> as<00:04:14.879> you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
have the wire through the hole as you

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.439 
have the wire through the hole as you
can<00:04:15.810> see<00:04:15.959> down<00:04:16.169> below<00:04:16.310> here<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.849> we're

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
can see down below here we have it we're

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.759 
can see down below here we have it we're
going<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.599> leave<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.049> just<00:04:19.380> like<00:04:19.530> this

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
going to leave this just like this

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.020 
going to leave this just like this
because<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.190> makes<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.489> convenient<00:04:20.820> to

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
because it makes it convenient to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.879 
because it makes it convenient to
disconnect<00:04:21.509> a<00:04:21.660> cigarette<00:04:22.019> lighter<00:04:22.229> plug<00:04:22.470> if

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
disconnect a cigarette lighter plug if

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.320 
disconnect a cigarette lighter plug if
and<00:04:23.370> when<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.610> don't<00:04:23.820> want<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.060> use<00:04:24.180> the

and when you don't want to use the
monitors

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.670 

and<00:04:32.060> now<00:04:32.509> we<00:04:32.570> need<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.870> connect<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.500> power

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
and now we need to connect the power

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.920 
and now we need to connect the power
cable<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.580> we<00:04:34.729> do<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.060> by<00:04:35.240> simply<00:04:35.300> lining

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.420 
clip here on both sides that's actually
designed<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.170> clip<00:05:16.380> into<00:05:16.680> this<00:05:16.800> metal<00:05:17.130> here

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
designed to clip into this metal here

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.300 
designed to clip into this metal here
and<00:05:17.580> then<00:05:18.150> we<00:05:18.300> have<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.810> tab<00:05:19.470> right<00:05:19.500> here<00:05:19.770> that

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
and then we have a tab right here that

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.360 
and then we have a tab right here that
actually<00:05:20.910> goes<00:05:21.060> into<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.480> tab<00:05:21.840> down<00:05:22.140> here<00:05:22.370> so

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
actually goes into a tab down here so

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.240 
actually goes into a tab down here so
all<00:05:23.580> we<00:05:23.730> do<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.060> simply<00:05:24.210> take<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.660> seat<00:05:24.870> back

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
all we do is simply take the seat back

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.890 
all we do is simply take the seat back
simply<00:05:26.250> push<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.670> up<00:05:26.790> right<00:05:26.970> here<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.480> press
