00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.040
 first thing to do to see the state of the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.059
 fund if anne the water in the funds 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.559
 it is essential to dry the boat 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.269
 all to avoid risks 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.759
 humidity 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.670
 so he is good he is advised 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 to open all the pass is accessible 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 good the boat is dry so I 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.730
 did not have too many worries and I 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 advises games how to advice 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 would I say to leave you the floors 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 open it allows a good so a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.840
 good ventilation of guns and it is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.410
 Very important 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.120
 here he will allow the boats to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 get away with it and be perfectly 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 know and it is strongly advised to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 empty the water tanks of levis 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 danger, however, is to fill the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.770
 fuel tank to avoid a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.399
 eventual compensation you make the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.410
 full of diesel 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.350
 it saves you a possible 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.559
 condensation the mattresses very important 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.969
 put them all to fields on the slice 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:12.600
 it allows them to breathe during 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:15.140
 winter is here and you can also 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.520
 open all that is force of equipped 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 all that forms of always equipped 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.119
 for a ventilation problem 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 you do that your boat will be fine 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.220
 ventilated and you have little risk 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.530
 humidity during wintering 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 the deck hatch covers and control 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.360
 if they are well jointed on the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.439
 new hood you have an opening 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.070
 ventilation puts the position 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.750
 intermediate 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.970
 always for ventilation is done 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.070
 perfectly well and also it is 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.649
 strongly advised to put blocks 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.450
 anti humidity in bins in the post 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
 front in the saloon and in the cabin 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.399
 back always so that the boat 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
 avoid this moisture that is latent 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.509
 we are in a marine environment and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.030
 the humidity and that's always 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.040
 present this does not not to neglect 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 of course all that is van van and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.409
 cock outs only at the level 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.740
 evacuation 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.450
 wc and sink and I advise 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.519
 strongly to put a small drop of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 four seasons inside the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.670
 toilet bowl to pump it very 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.480
 slightly it allows to check everything 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.620
 inside the pump 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.500
 here is cooking blog for the fridge has been 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.000
 cleaned and ventilated control and see if 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.340
 the gas bottle at the stove 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.519
 and closed off to enjoy it to know the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.870
 Preemption date of the hose is 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.400
 also of course grease the valves 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.019
 everything that comes from the kitchen and the company 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.269
 control them and possibly benefit 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.489
 of winter if a valve was hard not to 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.329
 hesitate to have it replaced 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.660
 cards substations card table 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.980
 do not forget do not forget to drop 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.769
 everything that is right at the level of 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.840
 instruments and I strongly advise 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.230
 if the boat stays out to dismount 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.569
 electronic boxes and destocking 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.760
 in their recipes be entrusted a 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.170
 electronics for a control that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.489
 comes an age if we store them at 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.739
 you in a dry and heated place 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.420
 for the winter the batteries of course 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.859
 whether it is filed by yard or 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.670
 are maintained all winter using 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.799
 of a charger do not forget also 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.180
 to deposit the batteries of the lights of 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.180
 flipping and other fake cards 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.019
 so on geese asec your 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.090
 boat and put down the hull would 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.590
 ousted you will take this opportunity to make a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.349
 humidity control of the hull that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.510
 it is possible if there is no how 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.099
 would I say the beginning of bones or whatever 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.049
 unit at the hull 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.940
 you will also control the line 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.620
 of tree misses by attacking him of course 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.049
 is also all that is twenty-two 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.459
 coop that came out of the control of 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.989
 the humidity can very well by a 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.489
 jobsite a lot of professionals have 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.110
 a type of device that is not a 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.940
 midi tester it can very well 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.680
 checked the hull by cons it does not need 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.390
 do not forget that you should never 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.560
 control the humidity of the hull as soon as 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.590
 audi output low for you have to wait 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.910
 a week and we realize we do not know 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.980
 of one thing is that boats 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.359
 who are landed every year 4 5 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.400
 months do not have moisture problems 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.290
 because he's dry 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.269
 on the other hand a boat that will stay seven 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.470
 movies 7 8 years afloat at reassure manceau 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.150
 full of humility in the croque without 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.340
 for that to have osmosis mara 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.530
 surely a moisture problem 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.320
 osmosis appeared 20-25 years ago 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.150
 because at one time we were persuaded 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.130
 at the beginning of the early polyester debates that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.280
 the young east coast and was 100% waterproof 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.169
 and that when we received a new boat 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.970
 we had a tendency to go directly 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.110
 of antifouling cluj leads the boat go 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.190
 we will integrate it is a boat in 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.639
 polyester there is no problem 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.440
 humidity 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.060
 we realized that the oak coast 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.050
 first was not waterproof and he 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.120
 was imperative 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.889
 when we received a new boat from 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.830
 put a layer a primary layer 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.919
 epoxy and epoxy is a 100% paint 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.630
 waterproof that isolated the seawater from the gene 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.979
 often sticks a lot of a lot of 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.320
 people decide to make a 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.430
 osmosis preventive treatment which they 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.250
 make an almost complete case of 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.289
 crazy lenses but he does not let the 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.270
 boat dry enough and they have 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.590
 trend they did not control the state 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.470
 general of the high level hull at the 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.630
 moisture level to lock in moisture and 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.520
 the moisture the epoxy preventing the 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.169
 the humidity of going out of school goes 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.580
 also prevented from going out so you 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.020
 risk of having microbubbles age that 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.030
 is formed between the roth gene and the 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.450
 deposit film cif has been applied 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.450
 on the hull 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.229
 the good engine I asked the yards 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.360
 to winter the engine is an engine that 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.629
 about fifteen years ago he pretty much 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.860
 700 hours good I asked him he 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.349
 was worth the engine it's first of all their 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.449
 have and a leap to wise to the water of course he 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.770
 will have performed motor show the drain and 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.259
 will place and replace all 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.389
 the flows so a woman the notepad 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.620
 clamart been drained that will make him inspired 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.639
 of a four seasons team for 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.530
 real cries all the inside of the engine 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.979
 all the world also to control the 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.599
 water pump 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.639
 the turbine after been changed the year 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.830
 last and relax the belts 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.120
 starter alternator 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.889
 then he will spray 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.030
 level of orders over the nation 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.949
 ground grease control 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.919
 close up control that's all it's a 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.719
 hurry all past a whole patres so 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.780
 I would also like to review the 13th of 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:10.460
 presto and the shaft and the propeller shaft and 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.150
 of course to change the anodes to the setting 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.710
 en route to the engine 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.419
 many things can be done 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.099
 on the one hand by a teacher a 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.050
 particular, six of which concern 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:21.620
 squares bad the maintenance of the lanes the 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.699
 washing reveals the rinsing of the boat good 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.900
 wintering motor it is still 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.729
 better to entrust it to a 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.229
 professional to a mechanic who told him 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.680
 least will validate his work by a 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.080
 fracture 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.969
 it will allow you to have fine arts 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.500
 want to have a maintenance record of 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.659
 boat that eventually turned out 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.190
 late at the end of wintering boats 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.650
 is a very important thing in the 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.110
 life of a boat and you must not hesitate to 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.060
 do it early enough that the yards 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.349
 are usually very busy this end 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.139
 of October so I advise you 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.330
 strongly beginning of 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.650
 choose a site if you have any 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.840
 you want to save your boat 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.099
 in a construction site or start to 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.879
 prepare the dams on your boat 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.879
 September October
