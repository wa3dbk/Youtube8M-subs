 good car but sad to let me go 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780
 soon it is endorsement x down because the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.400
 Chestnuts is worth worth I think 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.750
 You have to do something there that respects you 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.760
 the come down until after little 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.380
 first position or still I still notice that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 will advance this eye bad eye we advance 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.580
 success and has much better grip than 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:52.560
 that environment so perfect because yes 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.240
 let's take this from here let's go 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.630
 come on come on come on let's go give her the 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.630
 back in the air 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.890
 you have to go over let's go 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.020
 in theory it should have been caught 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.910
 since I do not know from there but it would be 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.780
 I came as 300 per hour or so 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.340
 I do not understand anything 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.290
 the case is that he has put first and 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.119
 took advantage of everyone and that's cool 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.520
 a lot because it means that I have many 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.470
 chances to win there is victory 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.580
 what a sweet story in guys or 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.400
 Victory is the best thing in the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.350
 world my brother just died 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.680
 to see where we're going through here 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 sir you have to bend true that bend 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.100
 around here so that perfect perfect 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.170
 perfect perfect we have a goal king eye 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.000
 I can see that you have seen these 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.860
 guys that I've loaded the gates the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.649
 window of the window glass I 've 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.350
 loaded with dome that I did not know that 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.460
 you could do it is felipe or I've 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.740
 was surprised and ximo to see that 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.539
 then there is a kind of barrels at 17 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.130
 containers that is because of fear of 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.110
 crash me with them I'm afraid of side 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.970
 as the palm tree does not explode is worth 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.190
 perfect what we have exploited we are going very 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.720
 well only that we get to the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.399
 second 12 seconds that are not very 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.510
 okay hand like batman the last one is a 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.490
 wrong 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.050
 any abuse to see because it's perfect 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.000
 because forward for the moment this 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.800
 it is being more or less well worth 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.970
 eye here comes the crappy thing I do not like 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.410
 nothing to jump with car containers 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.330
 because it was pressed sideways is but 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.940
 this time I have managed to do well 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350
 ok we'll let you shit for good 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.310
 see in hand has become suicidal but yes 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.310
 what does he do about his 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.609
 now I imagine that there will be who has returned 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.799
 perfect so what's perfect is what 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.200
 we have to do is go straight 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.700
 care care care care 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.700
 we control the car I will not recharge 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.530
 the point or the race if I get 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.000
 well I'm not going to recharge it in all the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.069
 I hope I do not crash and not recharge 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.840
 I would be pretty cool as 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.889
 I challenge this water and in fact you left me 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.299
 many that is not that they made the race 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.799
 are recharged and has done several is 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.510
 recharge but not if I want to do another one in 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.700
 plan has been the same you know to see 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.079
 Careful we have to do it well if 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.450
 we want the process without recharging we have 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.829
 to do well let's go yes sir we have 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.379
 caught the point that is very internal if 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.480
 They fall on rooftop to strain us 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.939
 perfect let's go I still can 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.150
 get that from not recharging point 20 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.639

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.290
 fast of the existing universe and over 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.400
 if an eagle leads you then better yet 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.840
 many people ask we have the mask 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.189
 of eagle this mask can not have it 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.049
 everybody because it was on behalf of the 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.489
 updating independence that is 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.900
 until it's July 4th again not 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.889
 you can put it back this has been 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.049
 put there to see if it can annoy me 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.130

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.000

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.020
 first twice and has not recharged the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.920
