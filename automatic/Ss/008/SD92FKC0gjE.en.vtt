00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 some insurance just killing me tale 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.120

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.700
 which one wants us a kind of city 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.430
 in which we have to help a man 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.140
 to a kind of as king and we have to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.760
 make it as small quest so that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.160
 this city can move forward and then we 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.929
 let hire a kind of worker 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.179
 for our city and create a 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.710
 city us us epic so one the 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.710
 The truth is that this one wanted to do it 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 a long time ago but he did not get 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.239
 in the end I discarded it because I had a lot 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 idea or good in the end end up doing and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.579
 I think that right now it can be a good 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.559
 moment to start this series 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.120
 so this review is going to serve as much of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.289

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.120
 small town and do some football 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.270

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.540
 tang by steam king 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.950
 actions of the world we are going to create a 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.950
 new world and I think if I'm not wrong 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.180
 pressing a key for the time of 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.920
 generate a world 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.960

 general the kingdom but wrong creates 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.400
 explained because I think I jump 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 directly if I'm not wrong 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.170
 yes ok but how was this how was this 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.480
 you see here has got us that we have the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:44.620
 theme of golf but I think it will go 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.620
 to see where I'm wrong nothing nothing 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.740
 how was this 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.370
 and tony todd and bears guiding the fence 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.590

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.940

 king double what is special 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.870
 let's think that build a thing a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.820
 epic building what happens is that I do not know 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.739
 if it's going to look great because we've 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.270
 built in the middle of the damn jungle 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.250
 It's a small cut so you do not see the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.050
 bar move forward the dnt and all that but 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.730
 Well it took like a couple of minutes 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.140
 and now he tells us to give him success 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.019
 to continue and now we will have 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.220
 created here a piece of super castles 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.050
 epic in which we are going to have to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.660
 work in fact we have here a 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.730
 small footbridge that takes us to the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.190
 hello mister pulo good castle indeed 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.010

 be with their usually their families and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.930
 everything so that we enter 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.430
 to see what they tell us 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 peaceful that's why nothing comes out but 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.910
 well it 's very well made of tickets and 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.040
 we already have our little ones 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.100

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.620
 weak in safe 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.560
 we have to save our little 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.550
 city ​​that this man happens to him also 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.190

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.930
 seller of things look here we ask 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.490

 or anything but good for you to do 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.620
 an idea here we have also the oven 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.810
 this man can make equipment by giving him 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 also looks can do good is 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.550
 and gave case is wanted to make a 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.440
 iron ax there is no one it is a 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.150
 iron pickaxe an ax yesterday not once 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.490
 with arrows of the whole end we can 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.000
 buy it expensive are we with the 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.800
 36 came the 14 of 18 in order and the and the 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.030
 goal is earned well selling from 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.030
 little things in this case of goal 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.670
 two 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.440
 and it's more you know we do not have to find 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.250
 what's coming will be the big guy who is 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.120
 the one that gives us the quest that is the king 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.010
 this more than anything for you to see what 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.349
 way it works to see if I find it 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.250
 I think it's been a long time since I said 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.990
 that I played and did not get to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.970
 well that to put it all I think that 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.380
 it was a good bank because here is for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.170
 sleep I do not know how we do not have anything then 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.200
 we put my kings did not work the 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.880
 creation of the kingdom the degree of the master's degree 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.410
 something like that is waiting for you 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.940
 we have to look for someone closer 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.710
 know where I was 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.900
 I think it was around here is this is 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.490
 a site besides giant guys and costs 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.450
 sometimes find things in fact there are 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.340
 here something to assume that it has not 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.980
 nobody remembers that I made 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.420
 went up and strange I think it also fails 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.060
 the last time I wanted for this I say 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.110
 you can play if you go around here 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.960
 now he goes up to find the man that the 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.790
 master enrique tells us you're not for 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.940
 here we have to steal a poster without 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.740
 want that this is this gentleman that such 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.870
 How are you doing with that beard? 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.890
 it seems that he wore a hood in the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.890
 mouth says I love you nonwoven 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.150

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.410
 Ginesta sign a contract and Peking Duck 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.540

 in our little kingdom we should 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.590
 do things for him to work for him a 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.969
 little so that we end up giving what 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.060
 we believe that it is a worked 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:50.909
 to make us this little kingdom and 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.379
 if we're around here and any hopper 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.969
 is more I'm going to investigate around here to 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.560
 going out is an idea of ​​what you can 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.810

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.849
 pepsi if you want to see me and playing 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.830

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.800
 an honor to look at the face of the unit for 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.599
 the series of definitive passes to make 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.340
 a little stove for me that looks nice there 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.659
 we are so good is the macho that I 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.560
 put the wiimote for a tour of it 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.330
 is for you to see what has been 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.350
 generated I do not have permission to do it 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.730
