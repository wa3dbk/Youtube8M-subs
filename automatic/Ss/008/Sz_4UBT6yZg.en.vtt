think<00:00:31.000> this<00:00:31.539> is<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.780> essence<00:00:32.169> of<00:00:32.410> music<00:00:32.969> not

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
think this is the essence of music not

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.340 
think this is the essence of music not
recordings<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.800> what<00:00:36.460> happens<00:00:37.300> live<00:00:37.930> on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
recordings because what happens live on

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:46.139 
recordings because what happens live on
the<00:00:38.440> stage<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:39.670> is<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.880> future<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.670> we

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
the stage this is the future because we

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.350 
the stage this is the future because we
can<00:00:46.329> take<00:00:46.600> risk<00:00:46.930> because<00:00:47.470> we<00:00:47.500> can<00:00:48.489> imagine

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
can take risk because we can imagine

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.220 
can take risk because we can imagine
something<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:50.079> can<00:00:50.260> create<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.850> moment

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
something we can create in the moment

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.549 
something we can create in the moment
and<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.800> think<00:00:53.860> it's<00:00:54.250> much<00:00:54.610> more<00:00:55.559> important

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
and I think it's much more important

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.989 
and I think it's much more important
than<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.989> perfection
