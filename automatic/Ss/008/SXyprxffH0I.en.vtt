they're both under the short and one

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.150 
they're both under the short and one
it's<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> short<00:01:33.400> one<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:33.910> may<00:01:34.180> use<00:01:34.210> with

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
it's the short one that you may use with

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.940 
it's the short one that you may use with
not<00:01:36.160> that<00:01:36.370> one<00:01:36.550> site<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:40.530> well<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.800> other

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
not that one site it is a well the other

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.200 
not that one site it is a well the other
spike<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.370> won<00:01:42.520> because<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.790> here<00:01:42.940> seems<00:01:43.180> to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
spike you won because it here seems to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.520 
spike you won because it here seems to
be<00:01:43.330> getting<00:01:43.450> bit<00:01:43.690> longer<00:01:43.930> at<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.140> back<00:01:44.290> at<00:01:44.470> the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
be getting bit longer at the back at the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.790 
be getting bit longer at the back at the
moment<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:45.729> you<00:01:46.030> could<00:01:46.210> use<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:47.290> I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
moment is that one you could use and I

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.190 
moment is that one you could use and I
think<00:01:48.100> that's<00:01:48.250> quite<00:01:48.460> good<00:01:48.490> but<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.750> short

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
think that's quite good but the short

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.100 
think that's quite good but the short
one<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:50.979> would<00:01:51.369> consider<00:01:52.150> using<00:01:52.479> as<00:01:52.810> well

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
one that I would consider using as well

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.990 
one that I would consider using as well
from<00:01:53.440> second<00:01:53.800> floor<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.190> goes<00:01:54.340> bear<00:01:54.790> with

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
from second floor and it goes bear with

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.900 
from second floor and it goes bear with
me<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:55.930> one<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.470> think<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.430> quite<00:01:57.490> looks
