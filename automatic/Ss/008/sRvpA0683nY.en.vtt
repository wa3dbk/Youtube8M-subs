use<00:02:34.959> gloves<00:02:35.290> as<00:02:35.500> well<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.190> developer

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
use gloves as well because the developer

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.160 
use gloves as well because the developer
can<00:02:37.720> bring<00:02:38.049> your<00:02:38.230> finger<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.750> haven't<00:02:40.930> got

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.190 
up there here but I find that the topic
here<00:02:56.560> won't<00:02:57.519> get<00:02:57.760> done<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.569> it's<00:02:58.870> going<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.049> be

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
here won't get done and it's going to be

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.690

over<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:46.109> developer<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.829> a<00:03:47.859> better

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
over here the developer this is a better

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.159 
over here the developer this is a better
way<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> do<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.730> rather<00:03:49.000> than<00:03:49.269> using<00:03:49.510> dye<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
way to do it rather than using dye and

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.940 
way to do it rather than using dye and
damage<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.739> hair<00:03:52.410> just<00:03:53.410> use<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
damage in the hair just use the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:03.880 
damage in the hair just use the
developer<00:03:54.340> only<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:57.660> I'm<00:03:58.660> brushing

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:23.000 

so<00:04:04.890> messy<00:04:05.250> go<00:04:06.230> endless<00:04:07.230> also<00:04:07.620> really<00:04:07.920> great

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.370 

you<00:04:23.850> can<00:04:24.030> open<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.480> up<00:04:24.510> as<00:04:24.720> well<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.110> get<00:04:25.260> the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
you can open it up as well and get the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.210 
you can open it up as well and get the
inside<00:04:25.530> bit<00:04:27.950> all<00:04:28.950> right<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.640> now<00:04:30.000> you're<00:04:30.210> gonna

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
inside bit all right so now you're gonna

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.420 
inside bit all right so now you're gonna
look<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.460> see<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:32.850> everywhere<00:04:33.420> is<00:04:33.660> covered<00:04:34.430> if

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
look and see if everywhere is covered if

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.030 
look and see if everywhere is covered if
not<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.210> go<00:04:36.420> back<00:04:36.630> through<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.410> do<00:04:37.800> some

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
not you go back through it and do some

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.290 
not you go back through it and do some
more<00:04:38.250> right<00:04:38.430> here<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:38.670> not<00:04:38.820> covered<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.120> me

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
more right here it's not covered for me

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.410 
more right here it's not covered for me
so<00:04:39.600> I'm<00:04:39.660> just<00:04:39.720> going<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.020> try<00:04:40.200> doing<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.650> I

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.940 

don't<00:04:45.420> want<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.630> unravel<00:04:45.960> my<00:04:46.200> hair<00:04:46.440> too<00:04:46.710> much

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
don't want to unravel my hair too much

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.260 
don't want to unravel my hair too much
because<00:04:47.190> then<00:04:47.520> it's<00:04:47.670> going<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:47.970> hard<00:04:48.210> to

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
because then it's going to be hard to

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.060 
because then it's going to be hard to
wash<00:04:48.480> it<00:04:48.600> out<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.780> stop<00:04:49.140> it's<00:04:49.740> going<00:04:49.920> to<00:04:49.980> get

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
wash it out and stop it's going to get

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.240 
wash it out and stop it's going to get
all<00:04:50.250> knotted<00:04:50.580> up<00:04:51.200> so<00:04:52.200> I'm<00:04:52.290> trying<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.710> keep<00:04:53.010> it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
all knotted up so I'm trying to keep it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.360 
all knotted up so I'm trying to keep it
