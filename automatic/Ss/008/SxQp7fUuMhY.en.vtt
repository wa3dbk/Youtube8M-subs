00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of doing it this way is that if you're

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.450 
of doing it this way is that if you're
less<00:00:39.390> example<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> header<00:00:40.370> included<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
less example have a header included you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950 
less example have a header included you
wanted<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> change<00:00:41.910> something<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> part

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
wanted to change something in this part

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
wanted to change something in this part
of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> design<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:44.100> you've<00:00:44.250> loaded<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
of the design if you've loaded that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.889 
of the design if you've loaded that
single<00:00:45.030> file<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> server<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.780> whole

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
single file to the server the whole

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.680 
single file to the server the whole
website<00:00:46.289> would<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.500> automatically<00:00:46.980> updated

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
website would be automatically updated

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
website would be automatically updated
you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:49.079> PHP<00:00:49.500> including<00:00:49.829> Dreamweaver

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you can use PHP including Dreamweaver

you can use PHP including Dreamweaver
you<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.610> construct<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.210> full<00:00:51.570> website

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you so you can construct a full website

you so you can construct a full website
using<00:00:52.340> PHP<00:00:53.340> including<00:00:53.670> Dreamweaver<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
using PHP including Dreamweaver but the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.299 
using PHP including Dreamweaver but the
disadvantage<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.559> using<00:00:55.620> peach<00:00:55.949> pink<00:00:56.160> Lee's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
disadvantage of using peach pink Lee's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
disadvantage of using peach pink Lee's
can<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:56.879> using<00:00:57.180> subfolders<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> linking

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

and<00:01:27.560> you'll<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> folder<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and you'll see that it's a folder with a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
and you'll see that it's a folder with a
few<00:01:29.460> images<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:30.110> we've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> includes

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
few images in we've got the includes

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
few images in we've got the includes
folder<00:01:31.740> which<00:01:32.040> contains<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.670> head<00:01:33.240> header

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
folder which contains the head header

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
folder which contains the head header
and<00:01:33.990> footer<00:01:34.670> index<00:01:35.670> page<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> those<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and footer index page and those are a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.020 
and footer index page and those are a
few<00:01:36.509> pages<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> style<00:01:37.740> sheet<00:01:38.040> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
few pages in the style sheet so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.789 
few pages in the style sheet so
essentially<00:01:39.840> I've<00:01:39.960> open<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.200> page<00:01:40.350> also<00:01:40.530> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
essentially I've open this page also in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
essentially I've open this page also in
Safari<00:01:41.340> still<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:41.970> mini<00:01:42.060> website

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
Safari still this little mini website

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
Safari still this little mini website
using<00:01:42.689> PHP<00:01:42.990> series<00:01:43.200> looks<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
using PHP series looks like the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
using PHP series looks like the
homepages<00:01:44.909> has<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> basic<00:01:45.450> introduction<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
homepages has a basic introduction and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.730 
homepages has a basic introduction and
tells<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> embed<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.149> include<00:01:48.740> like

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
tells you how to embed and include like

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.859 
tells you how to embed and include like
so<00:01:50.360> page<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:52.189> talks<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> about<00:01:53.430> using

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
so page one talks to you about using

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.789 
so page one talks to you about using
subdirectories<00:01:54.869> which<00:01:55.320> we'll<00:01:55.500> talk<00:01:55.530> more

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
subdirectories which we'll talk more

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.639 
subdirectories which we'll talk more
about<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.979> moment<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.930> page<00:01:57.930> two<00:01:58.170> talks<00:01:58.409> about

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
about a moment and page two talks about

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.679 
about a moment and page two talks about
maintaining<00:01:59.070> anchors<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.240> using<00:02:00.509> sub

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
maintaining anchors when using sub

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.560 
maintaining anchors when using sub
directories<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> unless<00:02:03.000> some<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.479> bit

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
directories so unless some a little bit

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.149 
directories so unless some a little bit
of<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> closer<00:02:03.869> look<00:02:04.049> at<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.590> Dreamweaver

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of a closer look at this in Dreamweaver

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.999 
of a closer look at this in Dreamweaver
if<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.119> open<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> index<00:02:06.780> page<00:02:07.049> you'll<00:02:07.950> see

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
if I open up the index page you'll see

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.050 
if I open up the index page you'll see
that<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.520> has<00:02:08.640> been<00:02:08.729> put<00:02:08.940> together

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
that the way this has been put together

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.570 
that the way this has been put together
is<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> top<00:02:10.530> part<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> website<00:02:11.160> has

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
is that the top part of the website has

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.130 
is that the top part of the website has
been<00:02:11.730> sourced<00:02:12.180> from<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> ink

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
been sourced from one of the ink

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.559 
been sourced from one of the ink
files<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:13.710> i<00:02:13.800> open<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.040> head<00:02:14.330> you'll<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.480> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
files if i open up head you'll see that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.610 
files if i open up head you'll see that
this<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> start<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.530> HTML<00:02:16.830> document<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
this is the start of a HTML document the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.750 
this is the start of a HTML document the
reason<00:02:19.920> why<00:02:20.010> there<00:02:20.130> isn't<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.400> big<00:02:20.580> header

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
reason why there isn't one big header

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
reason why there isn't one big header
and<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> title<00:02:21.360> separated<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.319> can

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and the title separated so that this can

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.870 
and the title separated so that this can
be<00:02:22.770> used<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.610> SEO<00:02:23.850> purposes

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
be used you know for SEO purposes

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
be used you know for SEO purposes
because<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.140> website<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.530> don't<00:02:25.680> want

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
because on the website you don't want

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.530 
because on the website you don't want
every<00:02:26.010> page<00:02:26.190> title<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> same<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.420> it's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
every page title to be the same so it's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.800 
every page title to be the same so it's
important<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> leave<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.230> separate<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
important to leave this separate the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.560 
important to leave this separate the
second<00:02:31.320> include<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> header.php<00:02:32.570> which

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
second include is the header.php which

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.540 
second include is the header.php which
includes<00:02:34.020> some<00:02:34.350> generic<00:02:34.680> meta<00:02:34.860> tags<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.400> link

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
includes some generic meta tags the link

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.390 
includes some generic meta tags the link
to<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> style<00:02:35.970> sheet<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.590> header<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.010> my

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
to the style sheet and the header of my

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.870 
to the style sheet and the header of my
design<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.890> I've<00:02:41.010> got<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.250> pages<00:02:41.610> unique

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
design then I've got my pages unique

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.490 
design then I've got my pages unique
content<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.569> then<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.810> finally<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.319> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
content and then I finally have a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.570 
content and then I finally have a
include<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.550> footer<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:46.680> shown<00:02:46.920> here

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.100 

and<00:02:50.580> then<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.420> good<00:02:51.540> thing<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.750> in

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
and then the good thing is in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.110 
and then the good thing is in
dreamweaver<00:02:52.739> i'm<00:02:52.980> using<00:02:53.130> cs4<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.060> this

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
dreamweaver i'm using cs4 I think this

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.720 
dreamweaver i'm using cs4 I think this
also<00:02:54.300> works<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.690> quite<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> few<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
also works in quite a few of the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.590 
also works in quite a few of the
backward<00:02:56.730> versions<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.269> actually<00:02:57.420> see

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
backward versions you can actually see

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.060 
backward versions you can actually see
the<00:02:58.050> design<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.350> little<00:02:58.590> bit<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> lot<00:02:58.800> using

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
the design a little bit a lot using

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.640 
the design a little bit a lot using
dreamweaver<00:02:59.400> templates<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.720> much<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.380> even

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
dreamweaver templates so much like even

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.140 
dreamweaver templates so much like even
templates<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.100> can't<00:03:02.280> actually<00:03:02.459> edit<00:03:02.850> any<00:03:03.060> of

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
templates I can't actually edit any of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.280 
templates I can't actually edit any of
this<00:03:03.239> information<00:03:03.420> that's<00:03:03.870> using<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
this information that's using and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.660 
this information that's using and
include<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.680> would<00:03:04.800> actually<00:03:04.890> have<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.190> open<00:03:05.550> up

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
include I would actually have to open up

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.009 
include I would actually have to open up
the<00:03:05.850> header<00:03:06.120> include<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.630> able<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.810> modify

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the header include to be able to modify

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.259 
the header include to be able to modify
that<00:03:07.140> information<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.400> all<00:03:08.550> other<00:03:08.700> access<00:03:09.090> to

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
that information so all other access to

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.390 
that information so all other access to
is<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> generic<00:03:09.900> area<00:03:10.350> which<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.920> for

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
is the generic area which is here for

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.960 
is the generic area which is here for
the<00:03:11.550> individual<00:03:12.030> page<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:14.820> take<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
the individual page so if we take a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.910 
the individual page so if we take a
close<00:03:15.150> look<00:03:15.239> at<00:03:15.420> these<00:03:15.560> accompanying<00:03:16.560> pages

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
close look at these accompanying pages

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.620 
close look at these accompanying pages
of<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> tutorial<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:18.000> basically<00:03:18.209> spend<00:03:18.570> a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
of the tutorial it basically spend a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.729 
of the tutorial it basically spend a
little<00:03:18.750> bit<00:03:18.840> about<00:03:19.019> using<00:03:20.209> subdirectories<00:03:21.739> so

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
little bit about using subdirectories so

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.140 
little bit about using subdirectories so
if<00:03:22.920> for<00:03:22.980> example<00:03:23.040> we're<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.730> make<00:03:23.910> a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
if for example we're going to make a

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.490 
if for example we're going to make a
subfolder<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:28.230> that's<00:03:28.380> so

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
subfolder in here like so and that's so

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.509 
subfolder in here like so and that's so
it<00:03:28.620> would<00:03:28.709> call<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.489> don't<00:03:30.360> know<00:03:30.450> services

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
it would call it I don't know services

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.400 
it would call it I don't know services
and<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:32.579> were<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.760> then<00:03:32.910> put<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.420> page<00:03:33.959> inside

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
and we were to then put a page inside

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.530 
and we were to then put a page inside
here<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.829> source<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.700> same<00:03:35.880> includes<00:03:36.269> files

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
here and source the same includes files

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600 
here and source the same includes files
would<00:03:36.780> need<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.110> then<00:03:37.440> go<00:03:37.650> back<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.890> layer<00:03:38.160> to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
would need to then go back a layer to

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.340 
would need to then go back a layer to
get<00:03:38.760> them<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.120> you'd<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.420> do<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> forward

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
get them so you'd have to do a forward

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.370 
get them so you'd have to do a forward
slash<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:41.070> source<00:03:41.310> those<00:03:41.489> include<00:03:41.820> files<00:03:42.380> if

slash to source those include files if

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.890 
slash to source those include files if
you<00:03:43.620> then<00:03:43.769> want<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.130> maintain<00:03:44.600> links<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:45.840> your

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you then want to maintain links in your

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.690 
you then want to maintain links in your
include<00:03:46.380> files<00:03:46.650> what<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:46.950> then<00:03:47.160> also<00:03:47.310> need<00:03:47.610> to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
include files what you then also need to

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.789 
include files what you then also need to
do<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.450> correctly<00:03:48.780> link<00:03:49.049> up<00:03:49.200> files<00:03:49.590> that

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
do is to correctly link up files that

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.400 
do is to correctly link up files that
are<00:03:49.890> in<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.040> include<00:03:50.310> files<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.380> example

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
are in the include files so for example

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.229 
are in the include files so for example
if<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.829> was<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.040> build<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.519> page<00:03:53.880> using<00:03:54.180> my

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
if I was to build a page using my

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.520 
if I was to build a page using my
includes<00:03:54.480> into<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.870> into<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.170> services

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
includes into it into the services

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.190 
includes into it into the services
subfolder<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.760> would<00:03:56.910> source<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.510> peach<00:03:58.019> pink

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
subfolder it would source the peach pink

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.360 
subfolder it would source the peach pink
hood<00:03:58.350> correctly<00:03:58.709> however<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.070> links<00:03:59.250> would

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
hood correctly however the links would

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.270 
hood correctly however the links would
be<00:03:59.459> broken<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:01.200> what<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.380> would<00:04:01.500> need<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.799> do<00:04:02.070> is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
be broken so what I would need to do is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.840 
be broken so what I would need to do is
open<00:04:03.030> up<00:04:03.239> my<00:04:03.480> includes<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.430> i<00:04:05.519> start<00:04:05.790> with

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
open up my includes and if i start with

open up my includes and if i start with
the<00:04:05.910> footer<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.690> an<00:04:06.810> example<00:04:06.959> i<00:04:07.790> would<00:04:08.790> need

to put a forward slash at the front of

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.699 
to put a forward slash at the front of

the directory this same principle should
be<00:04:19.500> followed<00:04:19.799> also<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.130> Java<00:04:20.400> scripts<00:04:20.729> and

just going to show you how to use this
now<00:04:59.060> okay<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.120> what<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.780> font<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.169> tool<00:05:01.440> that

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
now okay so what the font is a tool that

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.250 
now okay so what the font is a tool that
you<00:05:01.680> can<00:05:01.710> use<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.010> identify<00:05:02.250> typefaces<00:05:03.260> for

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
you can use to identify typefaces for

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.960 
you can use to identify typefaces for
this<00:05:04.350> example<00:05:04.590> I've<00:05:04.919> prepared<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.700> typeface

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
this example I've prepared a typeface

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.280 
this example I've prepared a typeface
which<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.360> could<00:05:06.510> have<00:05:06.600> scanned<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.930> potential

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
which I could have scanned in potential

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.780 
which I could have scanned in potential
from<00:05:07.380> document<00:05:07.800> which<00:05:08.010> just<00:05:08.220> says<00:05:08.340> Korea<00:05:08.610> I

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
from document which just says Korea I

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.980 
from document which just says Korea I
kind<00:05:09.090> of<00:05:09.120> remember<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.419> typeface<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.810> I've

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
kind of remember the typeface that I've

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.480 
kind of remember the typeface that I've
used<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.260> since<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.560> will<00:05:10.680> be<00:05:10.770> quite<00:05:10.919> useful

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
used it since this will be quite useful

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.770 
used it since this will be quite useful
tutorial<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:13.410> if<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:14.310> go<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.460> my<00:05:14.850> front<00:05:15.210> calm<00:05:15.540> /

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
tutorial so if you go to my front calm /

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.409 
tutorial so if you go to my front calm /
what<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.110> font<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:17.240> essentially<00:05:18.240> all<00:05:18.330> you

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
what the font and essentially all you

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:27.320 
what the font and essentially all you
have<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.600> do<00:05:18.780> is<00:05:19.190> upload<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.370> file<00:05:26.150> click<00:05:27.150> on

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
have to do is upload the file click on

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.270 
have to do is upload the file click on
continue<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:27.960> their<00:05:28.830> software<00:05:29.130> will

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
continue and their software will

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.310 
continue and their software will
essentially<00:05:29.630> identify<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.690> individual

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
essentially identify the individual

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.740 
essentially identify the individual
characters<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.280> word<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:33.479> you<00:05:33.540> can<00:05:33.660> see

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
characters of that word so you can see

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.969 
characters of that word so you can see
here<00:05:33.900> for<00:05:33.960> example<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.440> analyzed<00:05:34.830> the

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
here for example it's analyzed the

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.719 
here for example it's analyzed the
individual<00:05:35.340> letters<00:05:35.700> in<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.060> word<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:37.729> it's

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
individual letters in the word and it's

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:39.920 
individual letters in the word and it's
also<00:05:38.880> specified<00:05:39.270> here<00:05:39.390> what<00:05:39.510> it<00:05:39.600> thinks<00:05:39.720> they

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
also specified here what it thinks they

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.210 
also specified here what it thinks they
are<00:05:39.960> so<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.410> have<00:05:40.500> to<00:05:40.560> check<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.010> it's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
are so you have to check that it's

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.090 
are so you have to check that it's
matched<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.550> work<00:05:41.669> correctly<00:05:42.740> if<00:05:43.740> it's<00:05:43.890> didn't

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
matched to work correctly if it's didn't

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.200 
matched to work correctly if it's didn't
create<00:05:44.220> luck<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.490> has<00:05:44.610> done<00:05:44.789> here<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.060> could

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
create luck it has done here you could

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.920 
create luck it has done here you could
continue<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:51.060> shows<00:05:51.300> you<00:05:51.450> potentially

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
continue and it shows you potentially

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.920 
continue and it shows you potentially
what<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.080> name<00:05:52.200> of<00:05:52.229> that<00:05:52.380> font<00:05:52.740> could<00:05:52.979> be<00:05:53.930> so

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
what the name of that font could be so

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.290 
what the name of that font could be so
this<00:05:55.260> one<00:05:55.440> this<00:05:56.039> creator<00:05:56.669> is<00:05:56.910> written<00:05:57.180> in

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
this one this creator is written in

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.080 
this one this creator is written in
revenue<00:05:57.750> so<00:05:58.050> if<00:05:58.890> I'd<00:05:59.010> a<00:05:59.039> collection<00:05:59.700> of<00:05:59.760> fonts

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
revenue so if I'd a collection of fonts

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.200 
revenue so if I'd a collection of fonts
I<00:06:00.210> constantly<00:06:00.600> look<00:06:01.110> for<00:06:01.140> this<00:06:01.740> typeface<00:06:02.430> or

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
I constantly look for this typeface or

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.060 
I constantly look for this typeface or
potentially<00:06:03.750> purchase<00:06:04.260> it<00:06:04.410> if<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:04.710> needed<00:06:04.979> to

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
potentially purchase it if I needed to

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.980 
potentially purchase it if I needed to
use<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.310> for<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.820> new<00:06:06.120> client<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.600> had<00:06:06.690> it<00:06:06.810> for
