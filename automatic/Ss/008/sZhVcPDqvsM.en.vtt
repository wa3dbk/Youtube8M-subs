very small version of the frame we have

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.550 
very small version of the frame we have
larger<00:00:18.510> ones<00:00:18.539> through<00:00:18.960> an<00:00:19.050> another<00:00:19.289> filter

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560

Hall which are 60 centimeter square and
we<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.869> put<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> 200<00:00:22.680> sheets<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.609> now

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
we can put up to 200 sheets in there now

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.250 
we can put up to 200 sheets in there now
the<00:00:24.210> sheets<00:00:24.449> go<00:00:24.630> ahead<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.840> face<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.230> face

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the sheets go ahead and face to face

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.200 
the sheets go ahead and face to face
fight<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> back<00:00:26.039> face<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> face<00:00:26.670> back<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> back

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
fight to back face to face back to back
and<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.170> two<00:00:28.349> different<00:00:28.710> frames<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and there are two different frames in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.130 
and there are two different frames in
here<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> blank<00:00:30.449> frame<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
here there's a blank frame for the

here there's a blank frame for the
whiskey<00:00:31.439> comes<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.859> through<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.160> plate

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
whiskey comes in through this plate

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.459 
whiskey comes in through this plate
through<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> hole<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.840> between<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.320> two

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
through the hole in between the two

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.860 
through the hole in between the two
filter<00:00:34.860> sheets<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.030> feeds<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:39.690> also

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
filter sheets so that feeds in we also

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.049 
filter sheets so that feeds in we also
have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> frame<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:41.100> supports<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.700> filter

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
have a frame that supports the filter

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.520 
have a frame that supports the filter
sheet<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> filter<00:00:42.809> sheet<00:00:42.989> goes<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.290> top

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
sheet so the filter sheet goes on top

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
sheet so the filter sheet goes on top
like<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.969> whiskey<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.360> forced<00:00:45.719> then

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
like this and the whiskey is forced then

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
through their stove the flame through

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
through their stove the flame through
the<00:00:48.210> mesh<00:00:48.420> yeah<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.590> comes<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> hole<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the mesh yeah and it comes at a hole and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.590 
the mesh yeah and it comes at a hole and
this<00:00:50.430> side<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> opposite<00:00:51.390> side

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.179 
mentioned to me number of months ago
difference<00:01:30.900> different<00:01:31.320> layers<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
difference different layers in here and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
difference different layers in here and
it's<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:33.590> hate<00:01:34.590> work<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.650> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it's all hate work it is this like it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's all hate work it is this like it
isn't<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> sieve<00:01:38.579> quitter<00:01:39.090> serve

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
isn't just like a sieve quitter serve

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880 
isn't just like a sieve quitter serve
have<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> certain<00:01:39.900> size<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.770> will

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
have a certain size of all and it will

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
have a certain size of all and it will
catch<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> size<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.840> what's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
catch just that size this is what's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.170 
catch just that size this is what's
called<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> depth<00:01:43.530> filter<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.850> made<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
called the depth filter this made of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
called the depth filter this made of
cellulose<00:01:45.509> fibers<00:01:46.079> impregnated<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.040> their

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
cellulose fibers impregnated with their

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
cellulose fibers impregnated with their
crushed<00:01:47.759> seashells<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.509> are<00:01:48.630> Tinley<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
crushed seashells they are Tinley and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
crushed seashells they are Tinley and
the<00:01:49.920> whiskey<00:01:50.250> has<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.000> tortuous

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the whiskey has a very very tortuous

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.240 
the whiskey has a very very tortuous
path<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.229> through<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> filter<00:01:52.740> sheet<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
path to go through that filter sheet to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
path to go through that filter sheet to
get<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> other<00:01:53.610> site<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.390> twists

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
get the other site and it's not twists

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
get the other site and it's not twists
and<00:01:55.170> turns<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.159> these<00:01:56.310> corners<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.880> are

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and turns and all these corners that are

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
and turns and all these corners that are
in<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.509> grab<00:01:57.930> hold<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
in there that actually grab hold of the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.160 
in there that actually grab hold of the
material<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.369> strip<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.149> haze<00:02:00.719> form<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
material and strip out the haze form and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.940 
material and strip out the haze form and
particles<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.710> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
particles in it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
particles in it
so<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> delicious<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.799> Titus

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
so this is delicious that the Titus

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.040 
so this is delicious that the Titus
would<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.130> more<00:02:05.490> tunnels<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.180> bends

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
would be more tunnels more bends

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.410 
would be more tunnels more bends
probably<00:02:07.380> smaller<00:02:07.680> smaller<00:02:08.460> holes<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.270> well

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
probably smaller smaller holes as well

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.390 
probably smaller smaller holes as well
so<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.900> to<00:02:10.020> strip<00:02:10.229> out<00:02:10.380> more<00:02:10.620> flavors

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so it's going to strip out more flavors

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.580 
so it's going to strip out more flavors
yeah
