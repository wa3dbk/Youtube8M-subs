hi this is Leon of the computer and

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.949 
hi this is Leon of the computer and
knocking<00:00:02.340> I've<00:00:02.460> got<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.879> package<00:00:03.270> there's<00:00:03.750> been

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959

knocking I've got a package there's been
sent<00:00:04.259> here<00:00:04.529> from<00:00:05.460> memory<00:00:09.110> going<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:14.540> couple

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
adjustable drop that second generation

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.180 
adjustable drop that second generation
yes

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
yes

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
going on that obviously have been water

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.549 
going on that obviously have been water
damaged<00:00:56.379> is<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.860> cause<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.590> just<00:00:59.920> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
damaged is the cause but is it just a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
damaged is the cause but is it just a
LCD<00:01:02.559> problem<00:01:03.070> or<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.370> little<00:01:03.699> more<00:01:03.820> serious

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
LCD problem or is a little more serious

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.520 
LCD problem or is a little more serious
such<00:01:05.140> as<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:06.479> main<00:01:07.479> part<00:01:07.720> for<00:01:07.869> example<00:01:08.320> but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
such as the main part for example but

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.650 
such as the main part for example but
anyway<00:01:08.860> well<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.550> find<00:01:10.150> that<00:01:10.210> out<00:01:10.360> straight

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
anyway well I find that out straight

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.590 
anyway well I find that out straight
away<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:12.670> what<00:01:12.910> you're<00:01:12.970> gonna<00:01:13.090> see<00:01:13.240> No<00:01:13.390> okay

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
away from what you're gonna see No okay

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.109 
away from what you're gonna see No okay
put<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:13.960> some<00:01:14.229> power<00:01:14.530> into<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.580> iPad<00:01:15.940> this<00:01:16.060> is

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
put in some power into the iPad this is

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.719 
put in some power into the iPad this is
what<00:01:16.330> we<00:01:16.450> get<00:01:16.570> on<00:01:16.810> screen<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.740> now<00:01:18.340> I'm

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
what we get on screen and now I'm

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.469 
what we get on screen and now I'm
thinking<00:01:18.940> it's<00:01:19.600> only<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:20.640> faulty<00:01:21.640> LCD<00:01:22.450> I

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
thinking it's only a faulty LCD I

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.770 
thinking it's only a faulty LCD I
certainly<00:01:22.840> hope<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.610> reason<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.240> think

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
certainly hope so the reason I think

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.090 
certainly hope so the reason I think
that's<00:01:25.990> because<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.380> these<00:01:26.500> sort<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.800> dots

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
that's because of these sort of dots

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.160 
that's because of these sort of dots
here<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.700> can<00:01:27.850> see<00:01:27.880> on<00:01:28.450> screen

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
here that you can see on screen

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.670 
here that you can see on screen
they<00:01:29.920> are<00:01:30.070> fault<00:01:30.490> with<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> LCD<00:01:30.970> itself<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
they are fault with the LCD itself the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.070 
they are fault with the LCD itself the
back<00:01:33.130> line<00:01:33.369> doesn't<00:01:33.789> look<00:01:33.910> very<00:01:33.940> bright<00:01:34.330> now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
back line doesn't look very bright now

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.279 
back line doesn't look very bright now
that<00:01:35.350> could<00:01:35.500> be<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.490> brightness

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
that could be just the brightness

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.930 
that could be just the brightness
settings<00:01:38.289> that<00:01:38.530> have<00:01:38.649> been<00:01:38.830> turned<00:01:39.100> down<00:01:39.280> to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
settings that have been turned down to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.670 
settings that have been turned down to
working<00:01:40.270> with<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.630> dark<00:01:40.840> appearance<00:01:41.080> or<00:01:41.500> it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
working with the dark appearance or it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.779 
working with the dark appearance or it
couldn't<00:01:41.920> be<00:01:41.979> an<00:01:42.729> LCD<00:01:43.149> screen<00:01:43.300> problem

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
couldn't be an LCD screen problem

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.450 
couldn't be an LCD screen problem
pressing<00:01:45.789> that<00:01:45.880> button<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.770> works

unfortunately which is obviously a white
screen<00:02:32.260> brighter<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.670> then<00:02:34.850> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> other

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
screen brighter and then at the other

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.300 
screen brighter and then at the other
one<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.750> dots<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.380> they're<00:02:36.800> anywhere<00:02:37.130> that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
one the dots and they're anywhere that

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.140 
one the dots and they're anywhere that
would<00:02:37.400> have<00:02:37.520> been<00:02:38.290> quite<00:02:39.290> specific<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.100> that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
would have been quite specific to that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.320 
would have been quite specific to that
LCD<00:02:41.150> screen<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.730> looks<00:02:44.090> like

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
LCD screen so with that it looks like

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.260 
LCD screen so with that it looks like
it's<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.900> graphics<00:02:45.650> hardware<00:02:45.770> problem<00:02:46.489> there

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
it's a graphics hardware problem there

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.940 
it's a graphics hardware problem there
is<00:02:47.360> one<00:02:47.510> more<00:02:47.660> thing<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:47.930> gonna<00:02:48.050> do<00:02:48.350> which<00:02:48.920> is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
is one more thing I'm gonna do which is

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.310 
is one more thing I'm gonna do which is
disconnect<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.730> battery<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:51.080> try<00:02:51.260> it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
disconnect the battery and just try it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.229 
disconnect the battery and just try it
like<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.550> only<00:02:52.610> reason<00:02:52.940> I'm<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
like that's the only reason I'm going to

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.250 
like that's the only reason I'm going to
try<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:54.700> because<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:56.600> doesn't<00:02:56.959> seem<00:02:57.110> to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
try that is because it doesn't seem to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.140 
try that is because it doesn't seem to
be<00:02:57.380> sort<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.100> responding<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.640> trying<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
be sort of responding to trying to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.900 
be sort of responding to trying to
switch<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.530> why<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:01.790> said

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
switch it on and that is why just said

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.380 
switch it on and that is why just said
it's<00:03:02.230> sort<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.290> beep<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.830> though<00:03:04.760> well<00:03:05.209> that's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
one a an iPad or an iPhone makes this

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.070 
one a an iPad or an iPhone makes this
nice<00:03:12.769> one<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.040> charger<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:14.330> connected<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.930> it

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
nice one that charger is connected to it

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.910 
nice one that charger is connected to it
and<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.290> sounds<00:03:15.709> like<00:03:15.769> he's<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.070> switch<00:03:16.940> down

and it sounds like he's just switch down
so<00:03:18.920> yeah<00:03:19.489> but<00:03:19.670> I'll<00:03:19.760> leave<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:19.970> for<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.209> minute

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
so yeah but I'll leave this for a minute

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.710 
so yeah but I'll leave this for a minute

good to be honest

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.309 
good to be honest
if<00:03:26.379> we<00:03:26.560> look<00:03:26.739> here<00:03:27.220> this<00:03:27.700> connector<00:03:28.319> just

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
if we look here this connector just

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.009 
if we look here this connector just
noticed<00:03:29.879> this<00:03:30.879> connector<00:03:31.209> what<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.450> is<00:03:31.599> it's

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
noticed this connector what it is it's

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.600 
noticed this connector what it is it's
the<00:03:32.319> connector<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.040> goes<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.569> digitizer

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
the connector that goes to the digitizer

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.040 
the connector that goes to the digitizer
so<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.879> iPod<00:03:37.330> can<00:03:37.510> feel<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.989> touching

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
so that the iPod can feel you touching

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.920 
so that the iPod can feel you touching
the<00:03:38.500> screen<00:03:38.739> if<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.700> look<00:03:39.910> at<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:40.540> there

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the screen if you look at just there

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.589 
the screen if you look at just there
above<00:03:40.959> my<00:03:41.410> thumbnail<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.120> top<00:03:43.360> row<00:03:43.569> of

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
above my thumbnail and on the top row of

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.740 
above my thumbnail and on the top row of
the<00:03:43.690> contacts<00:03:44.200> as<00:03:44.379> well<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.629> looks<00:03:46.629> like

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the contacts as well that looks like

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.640 
the contacts as well that looks like
burnt<00:03:47.349> out<00:03:47.709> pins<00:03:49.049> I'm<00:03:50.049> gonna<00:03:50.260> look<00:03:50.410> at<00:03:50.560> that

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
burnt out pins I'm gonna look at that

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.530 
burnt out pins I'm gonna look at that
under<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:50.920> magnifying<00:03:51.069> glass

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
under a magnifying glass

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.990 
under a magnifying glass
but<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.080> doesn't<00:03:53.349> work<00:03:53.470> goods<00:03:54.000> obviously

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
but that doesn't work goods obviously

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.580 
but that doesn't work goods obviously

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
that's specific to the touchscreen on

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.069 
that's specific to the touchscreen on
that<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.890> LCD<00:03:57.220> screen<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.750> at<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.900> same

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
that in the LCD screen but at the same

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.979 
that in the LCD screen but at the same
time<00:03:59.380> it<00:04:00.099> doesn't<00:04:00.519> really<00:04:00.640> look<00:04:00.880> good<00:04:01.120> in
