00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.139
 hi to all with the puppet we are on the stand of sony we were able to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.499
 try a game ubisoft 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.730
 fabre very strong at four months the new soft ubi spse which was the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.019
 German price shown during the conferences 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.279
 almost 30 years old patrick we both played windeo months in a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.589
 first time one since we are a little help in what m think 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.399
 in this case it's not my thing ap 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.880
 while the respondent does not resist from the democracy side year 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.980
 it is a set of what we saw during the conception of their confession on 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.210
 do according to three approaches that's actually we could we could select 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.020
 to them three ways% and to operate a rail and passion of this meeting a 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:42.019
 little bit so 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.339
 all in stealth while discretion the way with the elephant then enough 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.679
 nag with rays machine gun it's all you need to have changed 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.890
 so that's the way I liked it most bass happened that the elephant 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.170
 to charge 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.830
 goal of constant of sorts the boards with the troop the scales of justice 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.180
 judging these cars are completely it's extremely easy stay and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.760
 automated when you think of it as you go on a door 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.370
 as long as you run five that being the same for the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.080
 cars and who does everything himself 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.890
 and if 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.440
 enemies the attak 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.260
 rather than attacking your fellow beings it's mayors all praised the greatness of 38 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.020
 years - it also aims at intelligent tourcoing 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.250
 It's the truth 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 and percent and contact and a third way to approach missions 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.980
 who introduces in the new the new vehicle the air vehicles 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.560
 a square for the first time in child workers 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.270
 after all why not and percent and they are legions that operates the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.710
 gyrocopter that is piloting a little better and slices mans 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.980
 this club 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.640
 - ad then I confess that I did not play my game that I took to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.630
 approached the funds because it's a big nag that I would pass well the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.390
 cstc preventing infiltration and silence I dropped for his part 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 contingent contagion to keep people is played 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.070
 wages that were losing galley because during the conference of prefects 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.549
 leak necessarily the same that serves very well played that's what it has 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.040
 given so much in the morning the canton the pressure control it's 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.649
 complicated because both crazy who controls the giro delays were 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.330
 predictable 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.890
 a series of evening variations in the final for the controls from 6 to 14 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.520
 August 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.809
 parent still at 100% point 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.169
 e but that's good it can improve is like optimizing danger on 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:15.789
 ps4 yes here is the little buzz assured 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.689
 sometimes not so crazy 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.719
 here he will take my mother likes but hey that will also probably settle or 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.549
 optimize or improved over time other than that no wonder that age pst 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.239
 hours announced 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.629
 punctuation first time where it is playable on consoles are not terrible at 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.849
 technical level because it's true it was not bad hallyday is when 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.460
 even 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.669
 author to prevent axa and that's it 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.159
 without the hands very very well 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.259
 the problem is that the numbers 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.339
 in any case where they are then passing in an elongated body I have 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.129
 want of ten players later confessed that it was one of the games I'm waiting 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.179
 the most for this e3 which is paradoxical but I did not understand why you 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.899
 did you do the Trojan three weeks ago but it's not long ago 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.179
 really there to see especially in himalaya me that I like it well then 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.069
 hoping that the enemy is also charismatic is not won but 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.889
 good 3 on the other so even so it's from lomÃ© to togo in town 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.159
 finally especially the psychopathic remake side is completely schizophrenic 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.989
 and turning frankly% I think this character very very very nice 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.050
 I was a little disappointed by the violence of the coup the previous ones I think 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.810
 for his debut at the stage provoked a little bit to spice up the advances of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.429
 violence 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.499
 and to understand that the game was pretty cool we had to play on pc are 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.789
 arrived on the spot is to you that I do not leave enough not the main tour 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.080
 more practical we will say to the West we will continue to 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.060
 to find alone in tip 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.060
 eva joly we tell you very quickly for other topics 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.369
 it's a dog or a cat
