00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 salute from Krasnodar today I would like to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:16.849
 tell about the first impressions knives 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:16.849
 fox his model is called pro hunter cx 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:27.269
 131 at first glance when I took the knife and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.679
 Loki I immediately about what we have this knife and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:36.320
 most likely to be very good 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.940
 assistant for any hunter 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.340
 look like a fox company 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:48.390
 the Italians thought out the geometry to the smallest detail 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:52.949
 let's start with the lady on the cake downhill go from 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.660
 butt downhill go not concave geometry 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.899
 the film itself allows very well 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.880
 cut and cut on the blade with us 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.010
 from above fillet minced blades for 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.610
 tip gain and just pass 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.610
 stiffener 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:19.259
 small ppl in order not to beat 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.580
 our cutting edge here is not bright 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.369
 pronounced subfinger emphasis will be 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:32.310
 which is not guessing look at 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.320
 mind shoes area 6 millimeters babes 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.500
 geometry bus descent I think that he 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.979
 will certainly cut look at these 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.720
 notches and notches correctly visions under 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.810
 emphasis thumb like with such a liza 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.460
 and with more rigid varese 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.670
 when you need to give something 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:01.480
 continue the handle is made of wood with 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.310
 patterned 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.200
 Penza most likely even here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.470
 modified n. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.500
 fixing goes on bolts which maybe 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.200
 unscrew and in my opinion this grip 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:24.070
 tonkovat was little that can be 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:31.570
 fix the feber layers in between 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.600
 dies still that interesting mounting knife 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:42.190
 will be 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:46.990
 futon she's at the top of the knife 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.960
 here is a structural heel with a hole under 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.820
 lanyard 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.150
 the knife is in the hand 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.360
 swiftly not apart from the fact that 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.450
 the handle is a bit thin 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:08.400
 but further work show how 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.890

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.000
