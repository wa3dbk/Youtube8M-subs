and he just looked like a man who was

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.410 
and he just looked like a man who was
entirely<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.039> know<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.249> his<00:01:29.579> own<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.389> know

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
man 111 when I saw him so it really

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.629 
man 111 when I saw him so it really
overwhelmed<00:01:35.039> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.399> think<00:01:35.429> that

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
overwhelmed you know but I think that

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.160 
overwhelmed you know but I think that
helped<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.209> the<00:01:36.270> portrait<00:01:36.719> now<00:01:36.929> had<00:01:37.139> I

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
helped with the portrait now had I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.260 
helped with the portrait now had I
worked<00:01:37.889> at<00:01:38.159> reference<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:38.579> photograph<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
worked at reference from photograph and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
worked at reference from photograph and
not<00:01:39.359> met<00:01:39.539> him<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.409> wouldn't<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> worked<00:01:40.770> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
not met him it wouldn't have worked that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
not met him it wouldn't have worked that
for<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.459> consolidated<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.270> idea<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.719> having

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
for me consolidated the idea of having

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.449 
for me consolidated the idea of having
to<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.679> subject<00:01:44.069> work<00:01:44.279> of<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.330 
to be with the subject work of the
subject<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.029> experience<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
subject and experience it and then that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.969 

successful<00:01:54.460> portraits<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.090> ones<00:01:55.240> which<00:01:55.479> are

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
successful portraits and ones which are

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.080 
successful portraits and ones which are
ultimately<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.039> good<00:01:57.189> painting<00:01:57.609> could<00:01:57.850> picture

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
ultimately a good painting could picture

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.020 
ultimately a good painting could picture
and<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.619> we<00:01:59.710> don't<00:01:59.859> feel<00:02:00.399> as<00:02:00.549> though<00:02:00.700> we<00:02:00.850> have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and that we don't feel as though we have

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.809 
and that we don't feel as though we have
to<00:02:01.149> engage<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> sitter<00:02:02.049> we<00:02:02.549> become<00:02:03.549> good

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
to engage with the sitter we become good

portraits in their own right much like a
writer<00:02:06.640> would<00:02:06.909> start<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.390> story<00:02:07.679> from<00:02:08.679> a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
writer would start a story from a

writer would start a story from a
particular<00:02:09.069> experience<00:02:09.670> they<00:02:09.789> go<00:02:09.910> off<00:02:10.000> a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
particular experience they go off a

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.059 
particular experience they go off a
tangent<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:11.200> something<00:02:11.500> that's<00:02:11.530> well<00:02:11.860> away

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
tangent and something that's well away

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.710 
tangent and something that's well away
from<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.370> actual<00:02:12.549> truth<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.000> subject<00:02:13.420> but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
from the actual truth the subject but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.229 
from the actual truth the subject but
it's<00:02:14.049> underpinned<00:02:14.530> by<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> subject<00:02:15.160> being<00:02:16.060> a
