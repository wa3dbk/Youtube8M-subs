00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 in which I come to bring you exists in the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 operating system 240 visa 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.410
 is the lollipop stop poe no forgiveness 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.360
 I put it here because its this 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.250
 he dropped his good channel his 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.200
 blogspot and dropped all its law 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.090
 of rice and then this one as 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.820
 then I leave them because the truth is 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.610
 very fluid has has plenty of power 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.610
 this still but this has here the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.220
 signs of the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.940
 from the east the signs forgive the icons 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.640
 of the lollipop type has the widget 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.370
 of transparent music in the hall 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 olancho modified with the icons has 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.380
 the one of marcatel one stock music 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.570
 touch 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.159
 What else can I tell you? 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.439
 after very fluent the truth 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.829
 right now I'm recording the description 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.409
 well, the narration is different from how 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.380
 I had it originally so let's hope 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.090
 to make the adjustments to see is very 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.940
 fluid they have the modified icons 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.790
 as I say 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.340
 has is free of junk applications 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.840
 and here in applications has script of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.940
 memory through internal storage 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.160
 have with the script 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.650
 now let's see the execution although in 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.330
 how much does the real round stop ? 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.770
 they want to be that in the sum for in the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.150
 video says that assume that they may see 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.090
 which is real and still so if you release them 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.870
 more then it leaves you better then this one 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.480
 here is the notification bar 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.450
 this one is modified ok this one 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.070
 like seeing us in the grenade or nothing is 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.740
 very state can bring the phone 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.300
 still have no stock they have loved 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.300
 changed the settings 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.070

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.070
 who is the one who let it change 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.960
 has the gallery also this coming 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.040
 By default how many 40 days is very 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.810
 suitable for 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.190
 very suitable for very fluid games 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.950
 you 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.100
 I now have games like 7 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.320
 games and they run very well 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.250
 I really like your fluency 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.520
 performance 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.540
 the battery lasts me about 15 hours and 6 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.540
 hours according to use 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.570
 and I liked it because it looks 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.620
 stock and you can and modifying it as 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.570
 to your liking as you want and this and then 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.220
 this would be all right then I leave you 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.830
 the link in the description I like 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.920
 share it in case someone else wants it 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.590
 since it does not have it in all the credits 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.320

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.320
