00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to you with the floor sabba and as 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.850
 of how i will find some 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.780
 interesting tracks in the section I dzheylbrek 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.059
 I will tell them to you today, I have already 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.610
 I found several tracks and I'm ready to tell you about 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 them and say well let's start 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.970
 drove first tvikami it very 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 strange name will not even it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740
 read all links and repositories as 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.330
 will always be in the description but this vika 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.710
 set password and find attached 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 which we indicate 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.080
 but for example, then see here there is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.619
 a few points when entering settings 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 tvika 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.050
 and in the first paragraph we are installing 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.930
 those applications that we want 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.059
 that is, absolutely anyone put on a feast 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 On photo on email clouds instagram and more 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 something like that you can set up a gesture 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.100
 activator to unlock for example 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 or vice versa put on the lock and 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 additional settings in principle here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 nothing more interesting are the following 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 already other settings 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 and here we set our password 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 which we want to put well to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 Unfortunately, a more complex password than on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.229
 four numbers can not be put further 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.810
 there is a time after each password is entered 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 eat immediately after 10 seconds after 30 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.939
 minutes and so on I set for example and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.700
 immediately and one more here and here on our 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.350
 strings from interesting only 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.930
 disable password when connecting your 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.030
 network and home Wi-Fi 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 Africa, the rest here is not really 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.850
 interesting let's see for example i 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.740
 I want to open 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.890
 Milo clouds and he principle me already 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.799
 requires a password that I lead and clouds 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.170
 we have already opened here is interesting 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.869
 screaming wouldn't say he's very big 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.600
 and functional but some kind of their share 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.270
 the security of our data and in the interest 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.430
 jailbreak he carries let's get down to 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.590
 last click 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.469
 ticks not much I found but the most 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.330
 I will try to bring you something interesting 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.030
 the last in our rubric for today 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.420
 not even a tweak but a suggestion backwards 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.080
 music junk actually i know it 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.630
 Developer who did this one here 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.200
 a small service, what is it like for example 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.690
 yes current without movies now this service 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.940
 is in development what is he 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.760
 represents but this is what tunes only 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 without movies as I said in principle 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.440
 for which user there is just 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.450
 Atas can be downloaded immediately and albums 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.120
 for example, or you can download for example 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.640
 just separate the songs are very convenient 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.709
 hope for those calorie users 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.959
 jailbreak and there will be no problems and make 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.500
 there account until the action is in beta 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 testing 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.160
 but soon it will all work is he 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.720
 repository standards and all links 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.310
 again will be in the description therefore 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.769
 subscribe to the channel join 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.410
