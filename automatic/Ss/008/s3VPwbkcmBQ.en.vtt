00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.800
 as always happened when the memories 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.710
 of the ancient world send in 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.090
 twilight a new era rises for 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.910
 fill a void 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.820
 a different path like the new breath 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.250
 a rhythm not dictated by work 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.340
 of man but generated by pulsation 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.090
 of the machines that project the world into 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.010
 an age of ambitious innovation but 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.370
 this for the steel role 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.149
 the sweat 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.149
 a perspective view 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.390
 taking advantage of the power of the elements 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.700
 turning the night into a day by creating 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 new devices they have introduced 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.750
 to the masses of world events e 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.370
 offering an experience that many don't 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.370
 they had not even imagined 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.420
 the advent of mechanized warfare 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.870
 by providing 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.630
 the only possibility to dictate 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.170
 replicate formisan and regime energies 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.170
 the rear 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.940
 pushing the world 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.240
 then 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.240
 Well 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.329
 many have chosen a decline 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 different and their vision introduced 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.380
 a perspective 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.990
 some have continued to pursue the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.450
 free thinking pursuing peace 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 as they struggled to unravel the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.119
 secrets of the universe some of which 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.930
 they filled our hearts with fear and 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.570
 regret 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.560
 with progress the limited nature of 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.030
 our world has appeared evident 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.120
 our survival 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.470
 everyone's 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.430
 depends on our campaign 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.430
 to coexist 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.160
 angel 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.410
 humanity will always look 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.410
 the challenge has always been 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.830
 to find out just to be able neither 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.170
 higher 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.810
 the awareness that this planet 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.740
 result 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.160
 8 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.750
 from responsibilities 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.320
 to know that decisions 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.320
 will 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.330
 on generations
