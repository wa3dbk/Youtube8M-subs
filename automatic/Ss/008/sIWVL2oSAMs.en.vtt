00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.269
 sometimes silvia reappears on these 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.580
 we have screens this time 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.439
 along with his from there his kitten who 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 now he is not so much a kitten anymore 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
 however, let's see how to move on this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 simple but simple processing 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 as effective as many others 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.920
 add a new level then up 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 at open levels 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.329
 I remember it for those who don't know less 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.890
 window levels and check to get 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 this vision 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 add an empty layer then 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 second icon starting from the right 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 then add a color over it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 literally we cover first here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 plan and use this orange that yes 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.789
 you can then also change it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.510
 then I confirm 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.949
 cue the one brush tool and in 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.830
 this position I'm going to look for the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.799
 brush I need I take one of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.820
 these these grids so a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.350
 great plot for those who don't find it here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 in the list can in this position 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 choose to load more brushes 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.689
 beyond those you can see and is located at 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 this between the simulated finish brushes 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.130
 here it is and I don't do it because of it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 would add others still there 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.430
 then found here in then list the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.060
 cues I love choose a dimension 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:43.380
 big enough to start then that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.329
 hugs a lot of the area of ​​the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 photography 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.990
 here I stop here a low opacity 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.619
 so it will mean that we would create ourselves 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 an opening that will have transparency 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.820
 quite limited 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.770
 let's fill this level in the meantime 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 then empty with the bucket tool 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.810
 keep clicked if you are there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.880
 nuance is a second item under the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.090
 color you have chosen prominently e 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.850
 paid into this level we activate one 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.739
 level mask third icons starting 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.470
 from left on this with a click the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.630
 activated you find yourself with the black color 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.299
 foreground the brush we have 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.450
 we had chosen before and we begin a 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.709
 create us in the openings in this way 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.590
 with dry clicks without dragging the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.030
 drag then would create a disturbance 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.480
 which is not the case for us 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.330
 therefore we reduce this dimension a little 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.480
 to get others also which others 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.940
 crickets and with different dimensions and therefore 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.459
 we continue in the opening so that yes 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.730
 see below a little at a time and that not 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 everything is done with the same brush e 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.420
 the same size we reduce again 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.840
 you have to go slow to not find yourself 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.630
 as in my case with a grid too 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.780
 small or too big and if you want you can 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.400
 select here and with the scroll wheel of 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.379
 mouse 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.299
 reduce by sliding it by sliding it 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.659
 we also see the dimensions in direct 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.000
 of the brush which increases or decreases in 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.010
 based on how we proceed with it 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.500
 continuous and continuous scrolling a 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.480
 naturally create an opening for me 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.359
 will be more evident in more areas 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.760
 interesting I'm doing so many clicks 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.540
 and this because i am working with 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.180
 low opacity when we have more or 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.730
 minus the picture of how we like it 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.290
 situation then we pass an opacity 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.590
 heavier more evident around 50 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.349
 percent and this will help us to open 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.480
 the image in the most interesting areas 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.540
 quickly maintaining a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.260
 little bit of this from this grid 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.819
 that anyway falls on the image me 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.470
 naturally I concentrate more areas 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.129
 interesting of the photo everyone 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.260
 will have its own and open to naturally 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.780
 as for one's taste for la 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.630
 photography that is found when we are 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.340
 happy with how this was created 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.770
 opening with counter click on the mask 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.860
 then against the keyboard click on 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.810
 mask we select automatically 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.849
 what is the external part of this 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.740
 of this colored area then the 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:41.159
 selection must be inverted from the menu 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.060
 reverse selection we activate the level 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:50.070
 background control c to copy or 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:55.020
 edit copy we activate the level more 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.949
 high and control v to paste is generated 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.370
 another level 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.810
 or always the paste modification is the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.960
 same thing and therefore we have if it hides 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.080
 a moment this is the transparency that yes 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.479
 was created with this copied opening 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.520
 on the background image and then added 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.120
 above this it serves to give more 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.590
 vivacity the photograph that maybe it is 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.180
 turned off a little bit with a little bit 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.669
 with this 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.280
 with these steps we modify the 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.650
 blending method overlaps then 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.310
 here from normal we go to check the 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.840
 overlaps and this to have a series 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.840
 one color more vivid 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.940
 more vivid more modern coloring 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.699
 more current 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.979
 I remember that the masks can be 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.539
 then resume if we activate it again 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.639
 we are left with the color of the first 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.860
 black piano and if there is that euro we notice 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.039
 that in certain areas there is no opening 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.050
 please or we exaggerated 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.759
 reversing in the white color we can 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.250
 recover and then re-emerge 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:03.000
 still the initial color I made one 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:06.389
 try to prove it but I did more 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.930
 damage that other then a step backwards 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:13.199
 and I stop here this is in my opinion a 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.610
 place like this has its own impact 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:23.539
 strength and in a different way again for to 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.539
 propose an alternative elaboration
