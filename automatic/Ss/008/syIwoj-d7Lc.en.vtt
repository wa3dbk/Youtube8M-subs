00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 if you get everyone I follow the month 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.200
 states and this is while we are up to date 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.170
 of agreed seeds and the seed and the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.900
 true that is somewhat peculiar 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.240
 different from everything you have seen 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.210
 I can say that I have already gone two years ago 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 seeds and has never happened to me in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 be these incredible seeds do not 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 incredible seriously is the seed when 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.800
 we go with him and creative to be able 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.280
 fly and then the seeds the next 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:38.940
 2 166 73 35 02 40 76 85 23 is worth nothing 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.739
 we create we are in version 1.2 7.2 no 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 I know if it will work on the rest of the seeds 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.480
 if you try it, leave me the comments if 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.020
 it works or it does not work according 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.670
 as you see we started in a swamp ballet 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.239
 and look what is special about a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.010
 swamp with a couple of trees nothing not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 has nothing special because here we do not 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 interest nothing and forgive because it is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 possible that I sneeze I will try that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.559
 not because I do not want to not say it is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.869
 something good agreement first thing we're going 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.100
 to do is to take us for sack when 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.140
 take by sack I mean very far 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:23.510
 - 2,293 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:26.630
 100 - 707 thousand 900 900 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.640
 and it's very far but why so far 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.480
 cords you never do something that is so 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.790
 away it has to be something very epic for 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.830
 that we come here good you have seen by 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.300
 here a village let's say a village 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.080
 yes a village but a village that in the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.360
 sure has a pyramid worth hello a 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.970
 populated with a pyramid inside a 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.500
 settlement in agreement does not have good logic 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.330
 part of the seeds growing here 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.710
 israel either and the wheat here or the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.860
 dykes and amazing hall with the town 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.920
 pyramid worth I consider it a 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.100
 extremely rare generation but 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 extremely rare worth very rare 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.990
 I do not know if you see what's coming 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.600
 being the state entrance that here is worth 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.760
 is moved but born with this it is worth 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.580
 just upload a video of mine 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.470
 As you can see it is a totally moved one 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.569
 epic voucher is great in fact it's a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.840
 that you have to recognize it is as if 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.840
 we enter 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.140
 several days carved or if we enter and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.110
 we come here the water itself should 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.340
 sneak on this side and do not sneak if 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.220
 we update the best if you think so 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.690
 well let's get a potion worth 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.260
 because I guess you want to know what 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.260
 there is here inside 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.620
 and the first thing we find is iron 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.620
 more iron with some gold 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.490
 gold and hamÃ¡s iron and that and a diamond 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.490
 hey well look for start is 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.380
 this water and I guess I reid to see if 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.840
 down here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.569
 there is or there is no cave no cave so there's 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.989
 a small cave if we find it 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.489
 because there's here, you see, it's a 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.840
 small cave in which if we continue 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.319
 walking we continue where we will reach 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.670
 more and more and good is the world never 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.450
 end up worth 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.450
 now let's go here 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.140
 ok and a good part of the generation is 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.770
 super weird we have a crop two 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.900
 crops three crops four crops 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.170
 no crops 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 crops 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.760
 ok my record is 12 put passes of 12 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.830
 crops so the truth is that it is very 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.260
 good for village roof with pyramid 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.150
 included and apart we have a smithy 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.650
 ok because yes 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.430
 or is great which we found but 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.920
 well, hey, hey, hey, more 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.620
 and voila, this is what everything has 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.810
 no more or less near here I have 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.419
 found a way very close in 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.630
 against a Spawn worth it 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.550
 we have here is already a pretty space 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.410
 funny is worth to vary more 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.410
 promoted because 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.440
 does not have chests of zombies stocks or 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.020
 because it's not tiny but it's coming without 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.680
 chests there is not a single problem of 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.010
 family are weak there is no chest we are going to 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.010
 go here 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.240
 so you can see that it's relatively 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.240
 near the village 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.290
 there is the town you see and what is found 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.450
 here it's worth so it's totally 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.140
 relatively close and this is the seed 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.330
 ok it's not super objects it 's nothing is 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.490
 find inside a pyramid not 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.100
 within a village worth a pyramid 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.690
 it is a generation and extremely rare 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.640
 ok then you like another law 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.760
 subscribe and tomorrow more and better until 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.760
 then
