00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
okay all right I'm gonna double dip just

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.160 
okay all right I'm gonna double dip just
because<00:02:07.360> you're<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.570> gonna<00:02:07.690> have<00:02:07.750> any<00:02:07.960> ranch

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
because you're not gonna have any ranch

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.889 
because you're not gonna have any ranch
so<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.440> think<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.920> other<00:02:09.789> SS<00:02:10.300> didn't<00:02:10.539> say<00:02:10.690> well

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so I think the other SS didn't say well

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.750 
so I think the other SS didn't say well
well<00:02:11.709> you've<00:02:11.830> done<00:02:11.980> what<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.250> double-dip

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
well you've done what you double-dip

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.280 
well you've done what you double-dip
