00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.850
 the polonaise the dressing room name powell much joy no polonaise 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.049
 but indeed nice victory and on top 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.359
 only when come 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.739
 all i know here are the applications the great rival ajax the zero 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.230
 held a big win for last Thursday's catch 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.380
 in short a ship on a human scale relief gladness everything you do then 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.230
 at such a moment yes exactly has injured it well i am not there enough 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.529
 can add to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 just aex from there I didn't draw and 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.210
 losing last Thursday it is really nice and I think so 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.850
 He thereby positively villages for a year 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.160
 if you have to look back it was linked to this competition is way above 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.110
 after we start well I think 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 the public will find out and you certainly want that in home games 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.140
 situation reverse the number of opportunities 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.210
 and then after fifty minutes of the council agreement 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.530
 ... Ajax Ajax Walk a little more dangerous Get some more backwards what 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.880
 chances and then 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.350
 yes go first my 0 0 but then the rest with them all heads together he 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 worked out well yes I agree that they are 0 to everyone 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.050
 match can literally go in all directions 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.950
 yes exactly that is 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.980
 say no, what would the cash register have after fifty minutes what happened in it 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.340
 the ruling surrendering good came again 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060
 nature communicated and today 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.310
 I think 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820
 have put down a good win there is moment of the match 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.869
 after all, the scrabble of your colleague in the other in the other goal 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.010
 after and not so much think that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.300
 years have to wait for a number of years also comes with its main brand 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.970
 term one and 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 the uefa 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.950
 I think it is just from our quality that we score four times 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.250
 meaning from that moment on 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 chasing British invincible over psv that proposal is not yet the case 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.490
 he climbed because of that you may indeed have a bit of luck where alone 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.690
 I have no further statements about knowledge, just not a very good keeper 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.370
 for nothing 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.340
 with ajax and with the dutch team so just respect for 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.840
 after throwing the safe what is that apple psv this season what i thursday 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.480
 saw a lot of what I saw today 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 two totally different teams two totally painter's neighborhood 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.810
 You've got that right 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.399
 maybe it was 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669
 afterwards for Thursday 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.369
 years difficult to recharge me in india an imminent craze then 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.480
 this match alone yes i prefer not to look back but i prefer to watch 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.799
 ahead vera thus still enjoy this red said bernanke 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.200
 In addition to ensuring that we have another very good game on Wednesday, yes 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.799
 buffoon's feelings were so today too 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.540
 added to that cracker against ajax, jewelry was always asked for support for 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.700
 its also such a match at home against ajax potatoes at something 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:42.209
 aparts and because it has remained normal today the national coach had in the stands 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.919
 yes but then it has 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.409
 I think indeed the match considering you already sort of summarized 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.819
 3 until the rest in all directions could be there from the fall we scored that 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.259
 we have force majeure 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.889
 call it
