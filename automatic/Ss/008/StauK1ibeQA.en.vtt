thing<00:05:03.680> cross-platform<00:05:04.490> play<00:05:04.970> i<00:05:05.450> think<00:05:05.810> that

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
thing cross-platform play i think that

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.440 
thing cross-platform play i think that
is<00:05:06.770> really<00:05:07.130> what<00:05:07.430> nintendo<00:05:07.940> needs<00:05:08.150> right<00:05:08.420> now

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
is really what nintendo needs right now

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.660 
is really what nintendo needs right now
can<00:05:09.020> i<00:05:09.080> establish<00:05:09.230> themselves<00:05:09.770> yeah<00:05:10.400> i<00:05:10.430> think

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
can i establish themselves yeah i think

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.790 
can i establish themselves yeah i think
especially<00:05:10.850> with<00:05:11.480> we<00:05:12.230> know<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.680> can

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
especially with we know that you can

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.050 
especially with we know that you can
only<00:05:12.920> have<00:05:13.070> one<00:05:13.130> of<00:05:13.520> these<00:05:13.610> tablet

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
only have one of these tablet

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.570 
only have one of these tablet
controllers<00:05:14.530> /<00:05:15.530> we<00:05:15.770> that's<00:05:16.220> something<00:05:16.550> that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
controllers / we that's something that

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.270 
controllers / we that's something that
we<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:16.940> do<00:05:17.510> we<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:18.110> know<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.650> think<00:05:18.770> we<00:05:19.100> pretty

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
we do do we you know I think we pretty

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.160 
we do do we you know I think we pretty
much<00:05:19.400> know<00:05:19.700> they've<00:05:20.060> been<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:20.570> vague<00:05:20.840> about<00:05:21.110> it

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
much know they've been so vague about it

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.840 
much know they've been so vague about it
up<00:05:21.500> until<00:05:21.830> now<00:05:21.890> I<00:05:22.160> think<00:05:22.250> they've<00:05:22.430> been<00:05:22.580> vague

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
up until now I think they've been vague

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.790 
up until now I think they've been vague
because<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.600> answer<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:23.900> yes<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.590> they<00:05:24.710> don't

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
because the answer is yes and they don't

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.770 
because the answer is yes and they don't
want<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.100> say<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.490> out<00:05:25.640> right<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:26.090> also<00:05:26.540> don't

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
want to say that out right I also don't

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.320 
want to say that out right I also don't
think<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:27.110> they<00:05:27.530> are<00:05:27.980> really<00:05:28.460> going<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:29.000> be

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
think that they are really going to be

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.630 
think that they are really going to be
as<00:05:29.570> expensive<00:05:30.260> as<00:05:30.560> everybody<00:05:31.160> thinks<00:05:31.220> they're

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
as expensive as everybody thinks they're

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.670 
as expensive as everybody thinks they're
they're<00:05:31.880> not<00:05:32.030> multi-touch<00:05:32.570> screens<00:05:32.990> which<00:05:33.500> is

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
they're not multi-touch screens which is

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.140 
they're not multi-touch screens which is
look<00:05:34.010> yeah<00:05:34.400> that's<00:05:34.550> another<00:05:34.790> thing<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.090> I

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
look yeah that's another thing that I

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.270 
look yeah that's another thing that I
want<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.390> see<00:05:35.540> actually<00:05:36.050> they<00:05:36.830> put<00:05:37.130> they

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
want to see actually they put they

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.130 
want to see actually they put they
changed<00:05:37.610> those<00:05:37.760> nubs<00:05:38.030> into<00:05:38.420> actual<00:05:38.690> control

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
changed those nubs into actual control

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.070 
changed those nubs into actual control
sticks<00:05:39.410> I<00:05:39.620> would<00:05:39.830> love<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.580> see<00:05:40.820> them<00:05:41.120> say<00:05:41.870> all

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
sticks I would love to see them say all

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.380 
sticks I would love to see them say all
right<00:05:42.290> you<00:05:42.800> guys<00:05:42.950> were<00:05:43.190> right<00:05:43.220> let's<00:05:44.210> make

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
right you guys were right let's make

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.910 
right you guys were right let's make
this<00:05:44.540> multi<00:05:44.900> touch<00:05:45.050> because<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.500> need<00:05:45.890> that

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
this multi touch because you need that

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.010 
this multi touch because you need that
on<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.430> touchscreen<00:05:46.730> and<00:05:47.180> shoulder<00:05:47.480> you<00:05:47.660> need

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
on a touchscreen and shoulder you need

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.820 
on a touchscreen and shoulder you need
it<00:05:48.200> but<00:05:48.890> I<00:05:49.280> think<00:05:49.700> in<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.630> pinch<00:05:50.990> if<00:05:51.260> they<00:05:51.500> made

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
it but I think in a pinch if they made

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.850 
it but I think in a pinch if they made
some<00:05:52.340> interconnectivity<00:05:53.030> with<00:05:53.390> the<00:05:53.480> 3ds<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
some interconnectivity with the 3ds you

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.200 
some interconnectivity with the 3ds you
could<00:05:55.010> potentially<00:05:55.100> use<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.730> as<00:05:55.850> control

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
could potentially use that as control

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.790 
could potentially use that as control
device<00:05:56.450> and<00:05:56.840> I<00:05:56.900> would<00:05:57.020> like<00:05:57.230> to<00:05:57.440> see<00:05:57.590> more<00:05:57.740> of

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
device and I would like to see more of

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.500 
device and I would like to see more of
that<00:05:57.890> you<00:05:58.310> could<00:05:58.520> potentially<00:05:58.700> but<00:05:59.240> I<00:05:59.300> don't

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
that you could potentially but I don't

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.790 
that you could potentially but I don't
see<00:05:59.630> that<00:05:59.660> happening<00:05:59.900> for<00:06:00.290> a<00:06:00.320> very<00:06:00.530> long<00:06:00.740> time

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
see that happening for a very long time

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.820 
see that happening for a very long time

their online strategy they're putting a

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.980 
their online strategy they're putting a
lot<00:06:12.980> more<00:06:13.160> emphasis<00:06:14.030> on<00:06:14.180> their<00:06:14.330> online<00:06:14.480> stores

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
lot more emphasis on their online stores

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.750

if<00:06:29.300> they<00:06:29.450> just<00:06:29.630> had<00:06:29.780> a<00:06:29.810> bunch<00:06:30.080> of<00:06:30.229> cool

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
if they just had a bunch of cool

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.710 
if they just had a bunch of cool
downloadable<00:06:31.220> title

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.330 
downloadable title
I<00:06:31.780> don't<00:06:32.020> know<00:06:32.080> how<00:06:32.170> much<00:06:32.290> emphasis<00:06:32.770> on<00:06:33.250> the

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
I don't know how much emphasis on the

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.920 
I don't know how much emphasis on the
eshop<00:06:33.730> or<00:06:33.970> anything<00:06:34.270> like<00:06:34.300> that<00:06:34.480> I<00:06:34.690> think

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
eshop or anything like that I think

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.050 
eshop or anything like that I think
it'll<00:06:35.290> probably<00:06:35.560> mostly<00:06:35.980> be<00:06:36.160> on<00:06:36.340> actual

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
it'll probably mostly be on actual

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.270 
it'll probably mostly be on actual
retail<00:06:37.360> titles<00:06:38.200> and<00:06:38.470> stuff<00:06:38.650> but<00:06:38.890> I<00:06:38.980> think<00:06:39.190> I

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
retail titles and stuff but I think I

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.250
