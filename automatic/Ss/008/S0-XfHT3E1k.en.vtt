00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.540
 My head is injured today 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.270
 Decorated flowers 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.270
 Girl on the market 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.019
 Plan regardless 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.019
 now or never 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
 I think it's good 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.539
 I've been working on something else 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.539
 Beyond being here to set 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.509
 Part-Time Job 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.300
 During the show Iris inebase 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.560
 I went ahead while I wanted to say 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.960
 Surprisingly everyone 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 Entrance to Children's Day 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.990
 It was a chat of leaves 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.990
 Which is four 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.540
 About 800 people 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 Ishikawa Prefecture 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.860
 It has become direct departure 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.430
 When it seems that it is likely to go 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 Neatly 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 So 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.110
 so 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.740
 End 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.740
 Planned 10,000 years BC 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.320
 I decorated the radar guard 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.620
 A bunch of peach flowers 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.109
 About this 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.329
 This fall draft company sometimes 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.620
 It was only after I stopped by the city I took Thompson. 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.549
 I got it unfairly, but the same thing is a little bit 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.119
 I feel like 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.319
 A little 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.430
 In addition to this, I think it may be a long-lived work 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.559
 Switched to a little 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.329
 Call for branches 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.699
 Even this thickness 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.699
 There is no problem at all in this side which we introduce 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.839
 If it is 60% 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.449
 Sang 3 songs 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.919
 * I think it's hard to get fat 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 This project 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.169
 1832 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.169
 Team 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.609
 Each period was three years 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.789
 Regular flights are further 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.789
 surely 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.269
 Last season actually 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.859
 Full of shiny 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.859
 Liquor start work 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.439

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.369
 Number 110 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.959
 Especially this time 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.959
 It was the municipal party committee secretary 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.029
 It is the case of Arai 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.029
 Movie client 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.229
 listener 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.229
 Is it dirty? 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.340
 Even where there were petals 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.199
 The results will follow 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.309
 Colo and 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.309
 Why half 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.789
 I can't give you a sense of cleanliness 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.020
 I belong to the screen 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.370
 There is no such thing 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.249
 I will never go there 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:56.819
 It is a smartphone that I bought
