00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
with sensitive equipment you can do that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.220 
with sensitive equipment you can do that

down drop the line feed it out put that
indicator<00:01:05.040> strip<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> water<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
indicator strip on the water then you

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.740 
indicator strip on the water then you
can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.540> emc<00:01:06.960> go<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> go

fluorocarbon and let that minnow do its

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.400 
fluorocarbon and let that minnow do its
thing<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> swim<00:02:11.760> around<00:02:11.910> down<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.540> helps

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
thing and swim around down there helps
