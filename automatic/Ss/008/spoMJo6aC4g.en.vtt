watching aquarium tech today I was going
to<00:00:06.150> go<00:00:06.359> ahead<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:07.230> another<00:00:07.500> video<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.040> tied

to go ahead and do another video on tied
to<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> filter<00:00:09.540> series<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.250> do<00:00:11.250> another<00:00:11.490> very

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
to the filter series and do another very

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.620 
to the filter series and do another very
simple<00:00:12.059> filter<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:14.580> under<00:00:15.089> gravel<00:00:15.450> filter

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
simple filter the under gravel filter

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.840 
simple filter the under gravel filter
okay

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
okay

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.640 
okay
the<00:00:18.150> underground<00:00:18.600> oil<00:00:18.750> filter<00:00:19.170> works<00:00:19.380> very

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the underground oil filter works very

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.200 
the underground oil filter works very
similar<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> sponge<00:00:21.390> filter<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.820> course

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
similar to a sponge filter but of course

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.380 
similar to a sponge filter but of course
there<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.960> no<00:00:25.260> media<00:00:25.789> obviously<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
there is no media obviously with this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.230 
there is no media obviously with this
and<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.689> fact<00:00:28.160> at<00:00:29.160> work<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> always<00:00:30.000> I

and in fact at work you know I always I
have<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.869> people<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> come<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.130> after

have some people that come in and after
they<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.390> under<00:00:33.660> gravel<00:00:33.989> filter<00:00:34.170> with

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
they get at one under gravel filter with

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.680 
they get at one under gravel filter with
your<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.800> kit<00:00:34.980> they're<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.309> where's<00:00:35.550> the

your little kit they're like where's the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.470 
your little kit they're like where's the
filter<00:00:36.690> medium<00:00:37.110> light<00:00:37.590> doesn't<00:00:38.100> happen<00:00:38.480> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
filter medium light doesn't happen so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000 
filter medium light doesn't happen so

very first you know it's kind of a
project<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.220> tank<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.450> 55-gallon<00:01:09.450> tank<00:01:09.810> had<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
project but tank a 55-gallon tank had a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.340 
project but tank a 55-gallon tank had a
under<00:01:11.610> gravel<00:01:11.970> filters<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.840> course<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
under gravel filters of course this is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
under gravel filters of course this is
you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> 90s<00:01:15.299> and

you know back and then like the 90s and
stuff<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.640> came<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:17.939> underground

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
stuff but came with an underground

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
stuff but came with an underground
filter<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.680> couldn't<00:01:19.920> keep<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.280> fish<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
filter and we couldn't keep a fish in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.830 
filter and we couldn't keep a fish in
there<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> save<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.299> lives

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
there to save our lives

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
and show you how they work but um

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
and show you how they work but um
basically<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.439> said<00:01:28.619> these<00:01:28.829> work<00:01:29.150> just

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
basically like I said these work just

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.740 
basically like I said these work just
like<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> sponge<00:01:31.290> filter<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
like a sponge filter or you know kind of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
like a sponge filter or you know kind of
does<00:01:33.960> um<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.250> operate<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.970> two<00:01:36.180> ways

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
does um and you can operate it two ways

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.130 
does um and you can operate it two ways
as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.329> operate<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
as well one you can operate it with the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
as well one you can operate it with the
power<00:01:40.350> head<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
power head and you know just like a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
power head and you know just like a
sponge<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:42.930> you'll<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.200> attach<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
sponge you know you'll just attach the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.670 
sponge you know you'll just attach the
power<00:01:44.100> head<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> top<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.680> what

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
power head to the top like that and what

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.319 
power head to the top like that and what
happens<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.369> course<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> power<00:01:47.850> head<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
happens is of course a power head it's a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.749 
happens is of course a power head it's a
pump<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:49.229> happens<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> sucks<00:01:50.520> from

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
pump and what happens is it sucks from

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.560 
pump and what happens is it sucks from
this<00:01:50.970> end<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:52.229> course<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:54.090> thing<00:01:54.149> kind

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this end and of course this thing kind

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
this end and of course this thing kind
of<00:01:54.659> creates<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.079> vacuum<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.799> you'll<00:01:55.979> put<00:01:56.219> your

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
of creates a vacuum and you'll put your

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
of creates a vacuum and you'll put your
gravel<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> top<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.469> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
gravel over the top of it like this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.209 
gravel over the top of it like this
and<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.090> suck<00:02:00.619> obviously<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.009> water

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
and it will suck obviously the water

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.969 
and it will suck obviously the water
down<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.960> course<00:02:04.259> it'll<00:02:04.500> suck<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
down and of course it'll suck all the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.160 
down and of course it'll suck all the
particles<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.640> materia

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
particles of materia

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.830 
particles of materia
down<00:02:06.409> using<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.009> gravel<00:02:07.549> as<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.820> filter<00:02:08.390> medium

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
down using the gravel as a filter medium

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.870 
down using the gravel as a filter medium
and<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.619> gravel<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.220> course<00:02:10.489> will<00:02:10.640> start

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
and the gravel of course will start

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.970 
and the gravel of course will start
growing<00:02:11.300> stuff<00:02:11.690> biologically<00:02:12.500> which<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.800> does

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
growing stuff biologically which it does

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.699 
growing stuff biologically which it does
anyways<00:02:13.580> without<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:14.590> under<00:02:15.590> gravel<00:02:15.950> filter<00:02:16.160> um

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
anyways without a under gravel filter um

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.250 
anyways without a under gravel filter um
of<00:02:18.709> course<00:02:18.770> not<00:02:19.160> as<00:02:19.280> quickly<00:02:19.730> but<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.810> uses<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
of course not as quickly but it uses the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.350 
of course not as quickly but it uses the
gravel<00:02:21.709> as<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> fill<00:02:22.310> also<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> mechanical

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
gravel as a fill also a mechanical

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.790 
gravel as a fill also a mechanical
median<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.870> know<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.170> traps<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
median you know it just traps the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.979 
median you know it just traps the
particles<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:26.239> course<00:02:26.510> doing<00:02:26.720> your

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
particles there so of course doing your

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.440 
particles there so of course doing your
gravel<00:02:27.470> cleaning<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.580> very<00:02:28.819> important<00:02:29.360> with

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
gravel cleaning is very important with

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.160 
gravel cleaning is very important with
these<00:02:29.630> filters<00:02:29.930> oh<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:32.569> just<00:02:32.810> kind<00:02:33.110> of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
these filters oh and it just kind of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.140 
these filters oh and it just kind of
sucks<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.560> down<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.040> then<00:02:34.130> blows<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.819> back<00:02:34.970> out

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
sucks it down and then blows it back out

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.470 
sucks it down and then blows it back out
the<00:02:35.300> top<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.790> course<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.090> know<00:02:38.180> they<00:02:38.330> make

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the top and of course I know they make

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.300 
the top and of course I know they make
things<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.170> certain<00:02:39.410> gravel<00:02:39.830> filters<00:02:40.190> you

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
things for certain gravel filters you

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.610 
things for certain gravel filters you
can<00:02:40.340> put<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.790> there<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.750> know<00:02:41.870> as<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.410> water

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
can put in there you know as the water

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.860 
can put in there you know as the water
flows<00:02:42.860> through<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.360> know<00:02:44.480> do<00:02:44.690> some

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
flows through it to a you know do some

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.229 
flows through it to a you know do some
extra<00:02:45.170> filtering<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.769> stuff<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:46.340> still

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
extra filtering and stuff but still

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.559 
extra filtering and stuff but still
doesn't<00:02:47.569> work<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.930> great<00:02:47.989> um<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:50.060> then<00:02:50.269> of

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
doesn't work that great um and then of

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.360 
doesn't work that great um and then of
course<00:02:50.660> there's<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> air<00:02:51.380> version<00:02:51.950> where<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
course there's the air version where you

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.490 
course there's the air version where you
just<00:02:52.549> take<00:02:52.700> an<00:02:52.850> air<00:02:53.000> stone<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:53.780> know<00:02:53.810> hook<00:02:54.319> up

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
just take an air stone you know hook up

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.630 
just take an air stone you know hook up
a<00:02:54.590> line<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:57.340> seat<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.489> in

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
a line to it and you just seat it in

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.420 
a line to it and you just seat it in
there<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.450> works<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> same<00:02:59.840> way<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.230> put

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
there and it works the same way you put

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.180 
there and it works the same way you put
gravel<00:03:01.430> over<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:03.260> makes<00:03:03.560> bubbles<00:03:03.830> of

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
gravel over it and it makes bubbles of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.460 
gravel over it and it makes bubbles of
course<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.269> creates<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.660> vacuum<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:06.260> there

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
course and it creates a vacuum in there

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.789 
course and it creates a vacuum in there
and<00:03:06.709> as<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> air<00:03:07.580> right<00:03:08.450> rises<00:03:09.230> up<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.560> takes

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
and as the air right rises up it takes

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.280 
and as the air right rises up it takes
water<00:03:10.069> with<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.850> then<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.870> course<00:03:12.140> water

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
water with it and then of course water

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.319 
water with it and then of course water
has<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.709> fill<00:03:12.950> back<00:03:13.190> down<00:03:13.430> due<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.670> gravity<00:03:13.820> and

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
has to fill back down due to gravity and

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.390 
has to fill back down due to gravity and
it<00:03:14.690> will<00:03:14.780> come<00:03:14.989> back<00:03:15.200> down<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:16.100> course

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
it will come back down and of course

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.190 
it will come back down and of course
just<00:03:16.970> keep<00:03:17.150> doing<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.630> doing<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.989> works

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
just keep doing it and doing it works

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.580 
just keep doing it and doing it works
the<00:03:18.320> same<00:03:18.500> way<00:03:18.739> uses<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:20.450> gravel<00:03:21.049> as<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.200> filter

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
the same way uses the gravel as a filter

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.130 
the same way uses the gravel as a filter
median<00:03:21.980> for<00:03:22.190> biological<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:22.940> mechanical

median for biological and mechanical

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.370 
median for biological and mechanical
alright<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:26.690> like<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.900> sponge<00:03:27.140> filter

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
stuff in there all right now going back

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.190 
stuff in there all right now going back
to<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.880> power<00:03:35.090> head<00:03:35.359> thing<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.989> where

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
to the power head thing this is where

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.949 
to the power head thing this is where
the<00:03:36.709> aqua<00:03:37.310> clear<00:03:37.430> power<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.090> series<00:03:38.450> comes<00:03:38.720> in

the aqua clear power and series comes in

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.319 
the aqua clear power and series comes in
handy<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:40.579> you<00:03:40.730> do<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.239> you

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
handy if you do it if you do and you

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.789 
handy if you do it if you do and you
really<00:03:41.959> want<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.200> stick<00:03:42.380> with<00:03:42.530> your<00:03:42.650> ever

really want to stick with your ever
gravel<00:03:43.280> filter<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:44.060> suggest<00:03:45.049> getting<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.500> power

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
gravel filter I suggest getting a power

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.170 
gravel filter I suggest getting a power
head<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.549> it<00:03:47.260> usually<00:03:48.260> works<00:03:48.440> better<00:03:48.709> uh<00:03:49.180> of

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
head for it usually works better uh of

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.050 
head for it usually works better uh of
course<00:03:50.739> it's<00:03:51.739> going<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.010> suck<00:03:52.280> more<00:03:52.489> water<00:03:52.790> and

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
course it's going to suck more water and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.819 
course it's going to suck more water and
whatnot<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.660> mean<00:03:53.840> bacteria<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.410> going<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.650> grow

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
whatnot I mean bacteria is going to grow

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.440 
whatnot I mean bacteria is going to grow
in<00:03:54.950> your<00:03:55.040> gravel<00:03:55.459> either<00:03:55.640> way<00:03:55.850> it's<00:03:56.030> not<00:03:56.209> very

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
in your gravel either way it's not very

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.470 
in your gravel either way it's not very
porous<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:57.650> don't<00:03:57.799> have<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.010> worry<00:03:58.190> about

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
porous so you don't have to worry about

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.030 
porous so you don't have to worry about
slow-moving<00:03:59.480> water<00:03:59.900> for<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.920> know

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
slow-moving water for you know

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.860 
slow-moving water for you know
nitrogenous<00:04:01.880> develop<00:04:02.329> bacterial<00:04:03.079> um<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
nitrogenous develop bacterial um and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.090 
nitrogenous develop bacterial um and
what<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.900> was<00:04:06.109> saying<00:04:06.350> with<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.530> Aqua<00:04:06.889> clear

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
what I was saying with the Aqua clear

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.870 
what I was saying with the Aqua clear
ones<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.579> especially<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.359> 15

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
ones is especially the 15

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.230 
ones is especially the 15
70<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.630> reversible<00:04:10.290> flow<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.310> right<00:04:12.060> before

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
70 have reversible flow so right before

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.030 
70 have reversible flow so right before
you<00:04:12.540> go<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.720> clean<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.470> know<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.740> can

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
you go to clean it you know you can

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.790 
you go to clean it you know you can
reverse<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.730> flow<00:04:14.850> have<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.420> puff<00:04:15.690> out<00:04:15.900> some

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:16.800 
reverse the flow have it puff out some

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.380 
reverse the flow have it puff out some
of<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:16.980> stuff<00:04:17.220> on<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> top<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.000> know<00:04:18.090> just<00:04:18.300> do

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
of the stuff on the top you know just do

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.100 
of the stuff on the top you know just do
it<00:04:18.510> for<00:04:18.720> very<00:04:19.470> quickly<00:04:19.800> and<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.720> know<00:04:21.870> that

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
it for very quickly and you know that

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.450 
it for very quickly and you know that
way<00:04:22.290> it'll<00:04:22.470> make<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.800> little<00:04:22.890> bit<00:04:23.070> easier<00:04:23.400> to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
way it'll make it a little bit easier to

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.130 
way it'll make it a little bit easier to
clean<00:04:23.790> because<00:04:24.030> some<00:04:24.420> of<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.600> stuff<00:04:24.810> can<00:04:25.050> get

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
clean because some of the stuff can get

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.720 
clean because some of the stuff can get
trapped<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.740> there<00:04:25.950> it's<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.610> know

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
trapped in there it's you know

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.350 
trapped in there it's you know
especially<00:04:27.030> for<00:04:27.240> movement<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.020> whatnot<00:04:28.350> and

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
especially for movement and whatnot and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.700 
especially for movement and whatnot and
of<00:04:30.360> course<00:04:30.570> they<00:04:30.690> come<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:30.960> various<00:04:31.350> different

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
of course they come in various different

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.500 
of course they come in various different
sizes<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.370> stuff<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:32.970> obviously<00:04:33.420> a

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
sizes and stuff this is obviously a

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.180 
sizes and stuff this is obviously a
super<00:04:33.930> saw<00:04:34.170> one<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:34.530> is<00:04:34.680> actually<00:04:34.980> for<00:04:35.130> like

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
super saw one this is actually for like

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.760 
super saw one this is actually for like
a<00:04:35.250> one<00:04:35.460> gallon<00:04:35.730> tank<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:37.080> serves<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
a one gallon tank but it serves the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.620 
a one gallon tank but it serves the
purpose<00:04:37.800> for<00:04:38.460> showing<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.940> example<00:04:39.390> for<00:04:39.570> the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
purpose for showing the example for the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.350 
purpose for showing the example for the
video<00:04:39.960> which<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:40.920> basically<00:04:41.370> when<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.640> needs

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
video which is basically when it needs

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.600 
video which is basically when it needs
to<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.870> bigger<00:04:43.830> ones<00:04:44.070> are<00:04:44.220> going<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.370> look

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
to and bigger ones are going to look

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.520 
to and bigger ones are going to look
just<00:04:44.640> like<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.240> except<00:04:45.600> bigger<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.380> know

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
just like this except bigger you know

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.100 
just like this except bigger you know
just<00:04:46.910> more<00:04:47.910> like<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> square<00:04:48.420> usually

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
just more like a square usually

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.930 
just more like a square usually
depending<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.680> course<00:04:49.980> on<00:04:50.220> what<00:04:50.460> for<00:04:50.790> what

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
depending a course on what for what

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.510 
depending a course on what for what
tickets<00:04:51.330> for<00:04:51.600> maybe<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.620> more<00:04:52.860> these<00:04:53.160> tubes

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
tickets for maybe have more these tubes

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.050 
tickets for maybe have more these tubes
coming<00:04:53.940> out<00:04:54.180> or<00:04:54.540> different<00:04:54.930> kinds<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.350> tubes

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
coming out or different kinds of tubes

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.370 
coming out or different kinds of tubes
but<00:04:57.060> it's<00:04:57.300> going<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:57.570> be<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.870> same<00:04:58.080> thing

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
but it's going to be the same thing

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.130 
but it's going to be the same thing
either<00:04:58.590> way<00:04:58.710> um<00:04:59.390> and<00:05:00.390> like<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.660> said<00:05:00.720> these<00:05:00.960> are

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
either way um and like I said these are

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.740 
either way um and like I said these are
were<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.320> worst<00:05:01.650> filters<00:05:02.130> um<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:03.390> best<00:05:03.540> thing

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
were the worst filters um the best thing

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.420 
were the worst filters um the best thing
I<00:05:03.810> can<00:05:03.870> ever<00:05:04.080> tell<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.620> do<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.890> never<00:05:05.130> buy

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
I can ever tell you to do is never buy

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.750 
having no filtration I mean your gravel
automatically<00:05:37.770> it's<00:05:38.010> already<00:05:38.340> going<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.520> grow

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
automatically it's already going to grow

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.730 
automatically it's already going to grow
bacteria<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.810> it's<00:05:39.990> going<00:05:40.140> to<00:05:40.230> work<00:05:40.440> as<00:05:40.620> a

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
bacteria in it it's going to work as a

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.530 
bacteria in it it's going to work as a
bacterial<00:05:41.280> meeting<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.790> stuff<00:05:42.030> it's<00:05:42.420> going

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
bacterial meeting and stuff it's going

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.820 
bacterial meeting and stuff it's going
to<00:05:42.630> fall<00:05:42.780> to<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.960> bottom<00:05:43.140> and<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:43.620> going<00:05:43.770> to

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
to fall to the bottom and it's going to

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.610 
to fall to the bottom and it's going to
work<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.160> same<00:05:44.370> way<00:05:44.400> anyways<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.350> mean<00:05:46.350> it's

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
work the same way anyways I mean it's

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.670 
work the same way anyways I mean it's
definitely<00:05:47.130> better<00:05:47.250> than<00:05:47.550> no<00:05:47.700> filter<00:05:48.240> but

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
definitely better than no filter but

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.610 
definitely better than no filter but
it's<00:05:50.300> that's<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.840> only<00:05:52.020> thing<00:05:52.200> it<00:05:52.290> is<00:05:52.410> better

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
it's that's the only thing it is better

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.080 
it's that's the only thing it is better
than<00:05:52.890> there's<00:05:53.040> no<00:05:53.190> filter<00:05:53.610> like<00:05:53.760> I<00:05:53.790> said

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
than there's no filter like I said

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.180 
than there's no filter like I said
there's<00:05:54.360> no<00:05:54.540> filter<00:05:54.870> it's<00:05:55.590> better<00:05:55.800> than<00:05:56.040> it

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
there's no filter it's better than it

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.100 
there's no filter it's better than it
and<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.610> know<00:05:56.670> a<00:05:57.120> lot<00:05:57.420> of<00:05:57.540> people<00:05:57.810> get<00:05:57.990> it

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
and I know a lot of people get it

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.570 
and I know a lot of people get it
because<00:05:58.380> it's<00:05:58.530> cheap<00:05:58.890> and<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.280> comes<00:05:59.490> with

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
because it's cheap and it comes with

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.330 
because it's cheap and it comes with
cheap<00:05:59.850> tanks<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.420> stuff<00:06:01.010> get<00:06:02.010> a<00:06:02.040> sponge

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
cheap tanks and stuff get a sponge

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.060 
cheap tanks and stuff get a sponge
filter<00:06:02.550> way<00:06:03.210> more<00:06:03.420> effective<00:06:04.790> usually<00:06:07.040> does<00:06:08.040> a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
filter way more effective usually does a

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.530 
filter way more effective usually does a
lot<00:06:08.310> more<00:06:08.370> for<00:06:08.760> your<00:06:08.850> tank<00:06:09.120> and

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
lot more for your tank and

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.820 
lot more for your tank and
it's<00:06:09.660> going<00:06:09.780> to<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:09.960> lot<00:06:10.110> easier<00:06:10.530> to<00:06:10.650> deal

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
it's going to be a lot easier to deal

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.990 
it's going to be a lot easier to deal
with<00:06:10.860> for<00:06:11.520> numerous<00:06:12.060> reasons<00:06:14.090> all<00:06:15.090> right<00:06:15.980> I

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
with for numerous reasons all right I

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.220 
with for numerous reasons all right I
guess<00:06:18.000> that<00:06:18.210> about<00:06:18.300> does<00:06:18.630> it<00:06:18.690> on<00:06:19.050> the

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
guess that about does it on the

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.050 
guess that about does it on the
underground<00:06:19.650> filter<00:06:20.130> like<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.520> said<00:06:20.850> there's

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
underground filter like I said there's

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.380 
underground filter like I said there's
not<00:06:21.180> much<00:06:21.420> to<00:06:21.720> it<00:06:21.750> um<00:06:22.140> I<00:06:23.010> don't<00:06:23.730> really<00:06:23.940> care<00:06:24.300> to

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
not much to it um I don't really care to

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.060 
not much to it um I don't really care to
get<00:06:24.510> into<00:06:24.810> it<00:06:24.930> anyways<00:06:25.290> there's<00:06:25.530> not<00:06:25.710> really

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
get into it anyways there's not really

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.060 
get into it anyways there's not really
too<00:06:26.190> much<00:06:26.810> science<00:06:27.810> and<00:06:28.320> stuff<00:06:28.530> behind<00:06:28.890> this

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
too much science and stuff behind this

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.060 
too much science and stuff behind this
obviously<00:06:29.640> it's<00:06:30.000> like<00:06:30.300> I<00:06:30.330> said<00:06:30.480> it's<00:06:31.070> it's

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
obviously it's like I said it's it's

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.110 
obviously it's like I said it's it's
it's<00:06:32.550> an<00:06:32.790> outdated<00:06:33.150> form<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:33.990> it<00:06:34.140> really<00:06:34.410> I

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
really shouldn't have been invented it's

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.590 
really shouldn't have been invented it's
pretty<00:06:38.250> horrible<00:06:39.000> form

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600
