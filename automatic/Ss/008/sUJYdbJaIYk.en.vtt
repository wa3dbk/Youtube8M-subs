 so much so that now they are automatisms and vip even 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.849
 no longer really need to think about it

 mehdi last tip before you throw at the poker table 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.680
 do not play randomly the first thing to do after learning the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.149
 rules and become familiar with the game itself is to study the technique 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.289
 this is not invented 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.530
 you will learn that every day for that there is little by cogent of course 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.030
 but especially the practice 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 you play to play you play you play you will lose and you will lose there 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.319
 you have to pay to learn you have to lose to learn 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.790
 select your starting hands not only according to their intrinsic value 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.050
 but also according to your position at the table 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.840
 compared to the buttons and bets of other players 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.740
 respect a certain discipline remember that poker is not 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.600
 only 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.560
 a game of chance 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.490
 observe around you 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.390
 do not fall in awe at your cards and besides waited for them 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.310
 watch it be your turn 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.160
 before nothing better than listening to the reactions the ethics of your 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.810
 adversaries when he discovers theirs at the last moment 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.930
 watch your game 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.570
 memorize once and for all 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.649
 at any time 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.609
 all senses must remain available to study the evolution of the 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.100
 situation 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.170
 first level too much time 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.119
 you will sometimes have many elements analyzed decisions 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.280
 difficult to take 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.520
 no precipitation 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.619
 play at your own pace take your time and also take if the decision is 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.420
 evident 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.939
 because if you think only when you have a problem our 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420
 behavior behind the line by our opponents 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.070
 even if they did not have 66 shots 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.160
 why but I told you mentally at least until five 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.620
 before taking action but obviously 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.720
 do not waste your time 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.000
 stop thinking that you need to every time 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 it's like the subway train it will always have a water that passes in a minute 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.850
 why he was not playing with anything under the pretext that the year is not 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 not huge 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.969
 this will sometimes require you to spend half an hour even more 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:58.750
 it is not serious 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.140
 it's sometimes boring but it's better than throwing your 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 money by the windows or to get eliminated a tournament 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.490
 beware of little dads 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.679
 people born between the two and the six especially if you are in the beginning 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.669
 of speech are very tricky to play 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.449
 your position at the table of thelma is paramount as is the number of 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.059
 players is the price to pay it's important to calculate your odds your 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.389
 hope of winning knowing that your main chance of winning the pot 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.789
 is to succeed a three of a kind those who arrive less than once in eight on 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:26.549
 the flop 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.439
 6 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.199
 learn to dose mobilize 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.290
 one of the subtleties of texas are limits and to know 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 do the right raises 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.260
 neither too weak nor too strong useless to bet 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.829
 when there is only without winning 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.879
 and inverted to bet passersby when he already put in the pot 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.029
 we also have to try not to bet exactly the same 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.369
 amount depending on the strength of your game 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.129
 varied not to lose the opponents parent 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.119
 if you say mats every time you have a max game 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:55.979
 that you make an average bet per average household and that you do not read 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.739
 if you have a weak game our opponents are too fast too fast 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.189
 who you are and too fast they have the gift of cards 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.539
 be we assume 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.779
 all stages of the blow do not hesitate to be aggressive and put your 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.389
 tokens first if the hand is worth playing 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.760
 if for example you do not have the slightest allows a more flush color 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.990
 10:15 on the flop 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.220
 do not be shy left early the solid block is a formidable weapon 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.129
 do not be that the grounds

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.899
 choose risk and all your chips on a bluff 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:32.269
 the important thing is to keep our lucidity your invincibility in all 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.329
 circumstances 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.940
 emotion is your enemy 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.320
 because they prevent you from analyzing all the information you 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.209
 have 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.829

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.749
 in any case try 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.089

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.530

 to work 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.830
