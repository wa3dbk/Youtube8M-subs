00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:21.819 

and<00:02:13.220> these<00:02:14.060> are<00:02:14.239> all<00:02:14.360> t6<00:02:15.040> textures<00:02:19.930> okay<00:02:20.959> now

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
and these are all t6 textures okay now

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.580 
and these are all t6 textures okay now
this<00:02:21.980> will<00:02:22.189> allow<00:02:22.370> us<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:23.079> untuck<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.200> cable

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
this will allow us to untuck the cable

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.559 
this will allow us to untuck the cable
for<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.579> battery<00:02:27.939> so<00:02:28.939> that<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.269> pull<00:02:29.450> up

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
for the battery so that we can pull up

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.539 
for the battery so that we can pull up
on<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.019> unplug<00:02:30.829> that<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.250> logic

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
on it and unplug that from the logic

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:39.170 
on it and unplug that from the logic
part

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.729 

now<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.750> battery<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.200> held<00:02:40.349> in<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.620> with

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
now the battery is held in there with

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.949 
now the battery is held in there with
adhesive<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> we'll<00:02:42.360> remove<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.599> later

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
adhesive so we'll remove that later

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.289 
adhesive so we'll remove that later
while<00:02:43.439> we<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.709> wedge<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.250> flathead<00:02:44.909> underneath

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
while we can wedge a flathead underneath

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.289 
while we can wedge a flathead underneath
of<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:46.200> loosen<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.530> adhesive<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.209> we'll

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
of it to loosen the adhesive so we'll

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.800 
of it to loosen the adhesive so we'll
flip<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.170> logic<00:02:49.439> board<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.799> little<00:02:50.010> bit<00:02:50.189> and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
flip the logic board up a little bit and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.309 
flip the logic board up a little bit and
lift<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> up<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.650> away<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:53.340> slight<00:02:54.150> bit<00:02:54.510> so

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
lift it up and away just slight bit so

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.630 
lift it up and away just slight bit so
that<00:02:55.379> we<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:55.650> remove<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.950> click<00:02:56.129> wheel<00:02:56.280> cable

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
that we can remove the click wheel cable

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.509 
that we can remove the click wheel cable
which<00:02:56.909> just<00:02:57.120> slides<00:02:57.329> out<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.659> there<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:59.129> now

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
which just slides out of there and now

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.699 
which just slides out of there and now
there's<00:02:59.700> LCD<00:03:00.180> screen<00:03:00.480> cable<00:03:00.900> we'll<00:03:01.319> just<00:03:01.530> slip

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
there's LCD screen cable we'll just slip

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.490 
there's LCD screen cable we'll just slip
right<00:03:01.769> out<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.569> we<00:03:03.659> can<00:03:03.810> remove<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.170> logic

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
right out and we can remove the logic

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.520 
right out and we can remove the logic
board

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.410

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.010 
the LCD screen is not held in with any
adhesive<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.220> grab<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.550> cable<00:03:14.020> and
