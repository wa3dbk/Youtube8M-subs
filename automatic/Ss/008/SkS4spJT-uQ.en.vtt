00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.089
 Welcome today, I'll show you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.080
 how to get the date display lighting 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.040
 changes everything we need completely 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.270
 normal cross screwdriver below 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.769
 a bit bigger than the first and you the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 you have to come here to screw 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.500
 Turn the ventilation grille downwards 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.679
 That's easy 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.350
 namely only with violence takes you 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.050
 best the big screwdriver and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.329
 start it with a bit of fabric with it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.270
 No scratches are pushing him up here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.250
 into the mouth and then just push 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.320
 completely exposed and the entire downward 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 then green then recognize where the screw 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.989
 sits and that would then once 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.750
 a screw here and once a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.699
 screw on the side you have to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.470
 then solve 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.129
 then you can easily get started 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 lose weight 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.400
 the last turns the room should 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 the attempt will be made with hand 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.850
 that you want because then receives 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.340
 very hard to get the number though 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 I show you how to do it 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.049
 So to step down as far as it is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.380
 going 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.430
 then the big screwdriver or 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:44.579
 a wooden wedges or when it comes to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:47.360
 press this up left and then 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.360
 easy 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 so completely 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.990
 the very top back there 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.050
 are then the second 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.810
 we screw now also removes even 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.550
 This solved one can get a cover 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:39.510
 just like easily be 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:42.180
 pull up on the hand back then 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 then there is a fortification so 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:53.430
 a clippers connection and that must 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:57.300
 we can recognize then also still solve 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:03.000
 there are the 2 because like us 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:06.320
 people like that and for the people to info 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.480
 still preferring to act the part 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:14.459
 here are each again two 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.340
 screw it out and then you would have to 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.870
 Could here be the complete cover here 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.970
 counting the hand can then hold off 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:27.269
 and in vienna with foil or 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.489
 Lackschuh asked him now you come in the job 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.549
 better to be at the back while 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.510
 not the problem that I am there 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:43.010
 from now on , we'll come here 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:46.260
 one good turn to grow then from them 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.930
 if the people were removed 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.549
 now the old ones are leaving the new ones 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.910
 have ordered green leds and the 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.130
 he gets the best you can get here 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.890
 Zanger can then simply oppose that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.350
 worlds 2 against the unforgotten 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.380
 if there's turned out nice 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.070
 careful that he did not break anything here 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.070
 or something else 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.979
 then there are quite good transmitters 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.049
 illumination beautiful green 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.750
 so there was a problem now and that 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.090
 Here are the old and there 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.590
 here these little contacts were the goods 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.020
 in which member so in the 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.970
 we ordered a little ordered lights 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.680
 bent too high therefore they have in the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.139
 mountings held Entrich because you have 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.750
 simply very carefully mahnfinger this 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.660
 a bit undercut and metal parts 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.660
 then you have a firm hold 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.580
 everything is also danone wackelkontakt 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.770
 vonstatten 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.960
 I hope I could get you in 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.910
 which help 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.910
 then until the 2nd
