00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:03.669 

today<00:00:02.659> we're<00:00:02.810> looking<00:00:02.870> at<00:00:03.110> reasons<00:00:03.469> why

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 
today we're looking at reasons why

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.740 
today we're looking at reasons why
sometimes<00:00:04.370> your<00:00:04.640> steering<00:00:04.970> wheel<00:00:05.270> can<00:00:05.540> sort

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
sometimes your steering wheel can sort

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.410 
sometimes your steering wheel can sort
of<00:00:05.779> wobble<00:00:05.990> about<00:00:06.380> when<00:00:07.250> you<00:00:07.340> brake<00:00:07.609> and<00:00:07.939> the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
of wobble about when you brake and the

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.760 
of wobble about when you brake and the
main<00:00:08.630> reason<00:00:08.990> for<00:00:09.019> that<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:09.560> there<00:00:09.650> are<00:00:09.740> a

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.770 
main reason for that and there are a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.530 
main reason for that and there are a
couple<00:00:10.010> of<00:00:10.130> reasons<00:00:10.370> but<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:10.880> main<00:00:11.060> reason<00:00:11.090> is

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
couple of reasons but the main reason is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.690 
couple of reasons but the main reason is
because<00:00:11.720> we've<00:00:12.050> got<00:00:12.260> worn<00:00:12.590> brake<00:00:13.040> discs<00:00:13.519> and

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
because we've got worn brake discs and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.089 
because we've got worn brake discs and
brake<00:00:14.630> discs<00:00:15.019> on<00:00:15.170> cars<00:00:15.410> actually<00:00:15.650> work

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
brake discs on cars actually work

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.269 
brake discs on cars actually work
similarly<00:00:16.609> to<00:00:16.760> bicycle<00:00:17.180> brakes<00:00:17.420> so<00:00:18.169> if<00:00:18.589> this

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
similarly to bicycle brakes so if this

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.370 
similarly to bicycle brakes so if this
disc<00:00:19.609> is<00:00:19.880> worn<00:00:20.300> or<00:00:20.720> has<00:00:20.900> got<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.079> bit<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:21.320> a

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
disc is worn or has got a bit of a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.229 
disc is worn or has got a bit of a
wobble<00:00:21.529> on<00:00:21.800> it<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.220> moves<00:00:22.400> around<00:00:22.550> that's

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:23.239 
wobble on it and moves around that's

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.300 
wobble on it and moves around that's
what<00:00:23.449> you<00:00:23.630> can<00:00:23.839> feel<00:00:24.050> on<00:00:24.319> your<00:00:24.739> steering<00:00:25.009> wheel

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
what you can feel on your steering wheel

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.609 
what you can feel on your steering wheel
when<00:00:25.609> you<00:00:25.669> apply<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:25.999> brakes<00:00:26.319> now<00:00:27.319> you<00:00:27.380> can

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
when you apply the brakes now you can

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.589 
when you apply the brakes now you can
easily<00:00:27.739> test<00:00:28.189> this<00:00:28.369> at<00:00:28.550> home<00:00:28.730> with<00:00:29.119> some<00:00:29.419> very

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
easily test this at home with some very

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.229 
easily test this at home with some very
simple<00:00:29.779> tools<00:00:30.079> in<00:00:30.409> fact<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.800> biro<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.399> with<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
simple tools in fact a biro and with the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.240 
simple tools in fact a biro and with the
wheel<00:00:32.419> removed<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:33.410> can<00:00:33.590> actually<00:00:33.710> place<00:00:34.039> the

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
wheel removed you can actually place the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.400 
wheel removed you can actually place the
barrel<00:00:34.609> on<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.730> brake<00:00:35.000> caliper<00:00:35.510> here<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.230> it's

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
barrel on the brake caliper here so it's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.709 
barrel on the brake caliper here so it's
very<00:00:36.949> very<00:00:37.309> close<00:00:37.609> to<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:37.910> disc<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:38.510> just

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
very very close to the disc so you just

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.689 
very very close to the disc so you just
kind<00:00:39.109> of<00:00:39.170> just<00:00:39.379> touching<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:39.859> and<00:00:40.309> if<00:00:40.429> you<00:00:40.519> turn

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
kind of just touching it and if you turn

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.369 
kind of just touching it and if you turn
the<00:00:40.879> disc<00:00:41.090> around<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.980> can<00:00:43.300> see<00:00:44.300> if<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:45.170> pen

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
the disc around you can see if the pen

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.819 
the disc around you can see if the pen
touches<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.920> disc<00:00:46.129> now<00:00:46.820> if<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.239> pen

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
touches the disc now if the pen

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.500 
touches the disc now if the pen
intermittently<00:00:48.829> touches<00:00:49.339> the<00:00:49.730> disc<00:00:49.969> you<00:00:50.300> can

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
intermittently touches the disc you can

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.479 
intermittently touches the disc you can
then<00:00:50.690> see<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.289> brake<00:00:51.469> disc<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.920> warped

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
then see that the brake disc is warped

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.860 
then see that the brake disc is warped
and<00:00:52.609> therefore<00:00:53.059> needs<00:00:53.269> replacing

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
and therefore needs replacing

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.869 
and therefore needs replacing
but<00:00:54.649> we<00:00:54.739> always<00:00:54.890> fit<00:00:55.070> them<00:00:55.190> in<00:00:55.280> pairs<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:55.820> you

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
but we always fit them in pairs so you

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.360 
but we always fit them in pairs so you
put<00:00:56.120> two<00:00:56.449> on<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.719> in<00:00:56.899> this<00:00:57.019> case<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:58.160> other

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
put two on this in this case the other

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.160 
put two on this in this case the other
reason<00:00:58.850> if<00:00:59.120> it's<00:00:59.329> not<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> brake<00:00:59.870> discs

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
reason if it's not the brake discs

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.009 
reason if it's not the brake discs
that's<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.409> warped<00:01:00.739> could<00:01:01.219> be<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:01.609> worn<00:01:01.969> tire<00:01:02.390> so

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
that's a warped could be a worn tire so

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.509 
that's a warped could be a worn tire so
we'll<00:01:03.140> pop<00:01:03.289> it<00:01:03.350> on<00:01:03.620> because<00:01:03.980> what<00:01:04.190> we'll<00:01:04.339> do<00:01:04.460> is

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
we'll pop it on because what we'll do is

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.250 
we'll pop it on because what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:04.640> put<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.879> tire<00:01:05.089> on<00:01:05.120> spin<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.900> around<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
we'll put the tire on spin it around and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.760 
we'll put the tire on spin it around and
have<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> look

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
have a look

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.430 
have a look
so<00:01:06.890> here<00:01:07.070> goes<00:01:13.780> right<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.900> next<00:01:15.080> thing<00:01:15.230> we're

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
so here goes right the next thing we're

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.200 
so here goes right the next thing we're
checking<00:01:15.650> for<00:01:15.800> with<00:01:16.100> brake<00:01:16.340> judder<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.030> see

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
checking for with brake judder is to see

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.390 
checking for with brake judder is to see
if<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.360> actual<00:01:17.540> tire<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.260> out<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.920> shape<00:01:19.190> or

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
if the actual tire is out of shape or

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.920 
if the actual tire is out of shape or
badly<00:01:19.760> worn<00:01:19.910> that's<00:01:20.330> gonna<00:01:20.480> cause<00:01:20.750> this

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
badly worn that's gonna cause this

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.380 
badly worn that's gonna cause this
judder<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.980> what<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:22.190> do<00:01:22.340> now<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:22.790> by<00:01:22.940> looking

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
judder so what we do now is by looking

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.380 
judder so what we do now is by looking
at<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.260> tire<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:24.980> can<00:01:25.160> now<00:01:25.250> spin<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.730> round<00:01:25.940> and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
at the tire we can now spin it round and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.900 
at the tire we can now spin it round and
see<00:01:27.050> if<00:01:27.260> it's<00:01:27.740> got<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.980> wobble<00:01:28.340> at<00:01:28.460> all<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.820> what

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
see if it's got a wobble at all and what

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.760 
see if it's got a wobble at all and what
I'm<00:01:29.030> doing<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.390> I'm<00:01:29.510> actually<00:01:29.540> focusing<00:01:30.350> on<00:01:30.530> a

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
I'm doing is I'm actually focusing on a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.980 
I'm doing is I'm actually focusing on a
fixed<00:01:31.160> point<00:01:31.370> on<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:32.030> ground<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.870> then

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
fixed point on the ground and then

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.360 
fixed point on the ground and then
looking<00:01:33.230> at<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.380> edge<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.770> tire<00:01:34.010> just<00:01:34.040> to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
looking at the edge of the tire just to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.180 
looking at the edge of the tire just to
see<00:01:34.580> if<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.420> wobbling<00:01:35.840> at<00:01:35.960> all<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.980> is

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
see if it is wobbling at all if it is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.580 
see if it is wobbling at all if it is
then<00:01:37.880> you've<00:01:38.030> confirmed<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.840> fact<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.080> you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
then you've confirmed the fact that you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.410 
then you've confirmed the fact that you
tire<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.190> causing<00:01:40.580> your<00:01:40.700> steering<00:01:40.940> wheel<00:01:41.090> to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
tire it's causing your steering wheel to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.080 
tire it's causing your steering wheel to
of<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.570> bit<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.870> wobble<00:01:42.200> when<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.890> brake<00:01:43.160> to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
of a bit of a wobble when you brake to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.940 
of a bit of a wobble when you brake to
confirm<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:44.750> what<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:45.020> could<00:01:45.200> do<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.530> swap<00:01:45.830> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
confirm it what we could do is swap the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.830 
confirm it what we could do is swap the
front<00:01:46.220> tires<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.850> put<00:01:47.270> them<00:01:47.390> on<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.540> back<00:01:47.690> of

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
front tires and put them on the back of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.840 
front tires and put them on the back of
the<00:01:47.900> car<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.350> back<00:01:48.470> ones<00:01:48.650> on<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.830> front<00:01:49.100> then

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the car the back ones on the front then

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.370 
the car the back ones on the front then
if<00:01:49.940> it<00:01:50.030> eliminates<00:01:50.480> it<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:50.960> know<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.260> that

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
if it eliminates it you know that that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.030 
if it eliminates it you know that that
is<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.560> problem

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
is your problem

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920 
is your problem
then<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:52.970> would<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.240> replace<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.720> tires

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
then you would have to replace the tires

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.970 
then you would have to replace the tires
with<00:01:54.260> some<00:01:54.410> new<00:01:54.560> ones<00:01:54.710> if<00:01:56.110> not<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.770> it's

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
with some new ones if not that and it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.350 
with some new ones if not that and it's
still<00:01:58.250> doing<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.640> then<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.880> next<00:01:59.120> thing<00:01:59.210> would

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
still doing it then the next thing would

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.420 
still doing it then the next thing would
do<00:01:59.540> is<00:01:59.960> actually<00:02:00.170> check<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.650> wear<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
do is actually check for wear in the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.060 
do is actually check for wear in the
steering<00:02:01.940> or<00:02:02.180> suspension<00:02:02.840> components<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.860> we

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
steering or suspension components and we

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.220 
steering or suspension components and we
can<00:02:04.190> do<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.430> quite<00:02:04.640> easily<00:02:04.880> by<00:02:05.300> getting<00:02:06.050> hold

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
can do that quite easily by getting hold

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.589 
can do that quite easily by getting hold
of<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.440> wheel<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.000> feeling<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:08.179> play<00:02:08.390> and

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
of the wheel and feeling for play and

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.790 
of the wheel and feeling for play and
you<00:02:08.840> can<00:02:08.959> see<00:02:09.140> there's<00:02:09.289> actually<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> bit<00:02:09.710> of

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
you can see there's actually a bit of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.460 
you can see there's actually a bit of
play<00:02:10.009> in<00:02:10.039> there<00:02:10.970> somewhere<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.570> possibly

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
play in there somewhere and possibly

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.440 
play in there somewhere and possibly
that<00:02:12.710> way<00:02:12.860> as<00:02:12.980> well<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:13.730> I'd<00:02:13.850> say<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.090> that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
that way as well but I'd say that that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.100 
that way as well but I'd say that that
play

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
play

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.800 
play
that<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:15.470> see<00:02:15.650> there<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.670> probably<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
that we can see there it's probably the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.900 
that we can see there it's probably the
cause<00:02:18.050> in<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.440> case<00:02:18.710> because<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.700> brake

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
cause in this case because the brake

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.740 
cause in this case because the brake
disk<00:02:20.090> was<00:02:20.270> okay<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> tire<00:02:21.620> was<00:02:21.740> okay

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
disk was okay and the tire was okay

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.930 
disk was okay and the tire was okay
you've<00:02:23.750> now<00:02:23.990> diagnose<00:02:24.530> roughly<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> area

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
you've now diagnose roughly the area

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.870 
you've now diagnose roughly the area
where<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.080> problem<00:02:27.800> on<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> car<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.820> if

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
where the problem on the car is and if

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.220 
where the problem on the car is and if
you<00:02:28.970> can't<00:02:29.240> fix<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.570> yourself<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.200> least

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
you can't fix it yourself at least

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.510 
you can't fix it yourself at least
you've<00:02:30.470> got<00:02:30.500> an<00:02:30.680> idea<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.010> what<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.340> can<00:02:31.430> be

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
you've got an idea of what you can be

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.630 
you've got an idea of what you can be
paying<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.660> garage<00:02:33.310> I'll<00:02:34.310> be<00:02:34.490> back

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
paying for in the garage I'll be back

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.060 
paying for in the garage I'll be back
