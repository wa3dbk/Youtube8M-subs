00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.099 
better on sale they've got sold for them
almost<00:00:32.020> like<00:00:32.230> $30<00:00:32.980> but<00:00:33.449> this<00:00:34.449> is<00:00:34.600> actual<00:00:34.899> price

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
almost like $30 but this is actual price

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.529 
almost like $30 but this is actual price
to<00:00:37.019> $44<00:00:38.019> under<00:00:38.350> $45<00:00:39.069> and<00:00:39.309> then<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.329> tax

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
to $44 under $45 and then the tax

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.299 
to $44 under $45 and then the tax
afterwards<00:00:43.199> so<00:00:44.199> it's<00:00:44.379> just<00:00:44.589> about<00:00:44.979> the<00:00:45.159> best

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
afterwards so it's just about the best

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.459 
afterwards so it's just about the best
best<00:00:45.609> or<00:00:45.999> let's<00:00:46.449> just<00:00:46.539> look<00:00:46.780> at<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:46.989> Box<00:00:47.199> first

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
best or let's just look at the Box first

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.790 
best or let's just look at the Box first
so<00:00:47.829> if<00:00:48.039> it<00:00:48.219> says<00:00:48.489> that<00:00:49.409> it's<00:00:50.409> supposed<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.890> be

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so if it says that it's supposed to be

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.219 
so if it says that it's supposed to be
10<00:00:53.800> times<00:00:54.100> faster<00:00:56.399> than<00:00:57.399> USB<00:00:57.729> 2.0<00:00:58.589> of<00:00:59.589> to<00:01:00.159> 60

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
10 times faster than USB 2.0 of to 60

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.760 
10 times faster than USB 2.0 of to 60
Mbps<00:01:02.229> read<00:01:02.649> and<00:01:02.920> 25<00:01:03.579> Mbps<00:01:03.999> right<00:01:05.340> stayed<00:01:06.340> very

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
Mbps read and 25 Mbps right stayed very

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.170 
Mbps read and 25 Mbps right stayed very
small<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:11.580> used<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.700> have<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:14.640> used<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.760> have<00:01:15.970> this

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
small I used to have I used to have this

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.410 
small I used to have I used to have this
USB<00:01:16.660> 2.0<00:01:17.140> from<00:01:17.770> papered<00:01:18.280> memory<00:01:18.610> this<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.120> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
USB 2.0 from papered memory this is the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.510 
USB 2.0 from papered memory this is the
16gb<00:01:22.080> exporter<00:01:23.080> rage<00:01:23.440> or<00:01:23.710> something<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:24.250> forgot

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
16gb exporter rage or something I forgot

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.660 
16gb exporter rage or something I forgot
the<00:01:24.730> new<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.890> had<00:01:27.010> this<00:01:27.160> just<00:01:27.730> broke<00:01:28.000> down

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the new but you had this just broke down

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670 
the new but you had this just broke down
like<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:31.570> part<00:01:31.870> of<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.350> think<00:01:32.410> it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
like this part of it and I think it

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.900 
like this part of it and I think it
broke<00:01:32.830> down<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.490> didn't<00:01:33.730> work<00:01:33.760> properly

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
broke down so it didn't work properly

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.560 
broke down so it didn't work properly
anymore<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:34.960> had<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.550> move<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.910> bigger<00:01:37.150> and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
anymore so had to move to the bigger and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.800 
anymore so had to move to the bigger and
better<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.300> says<00:01:40.510> that<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:42.240> USB<00:01:43.240> 3.0

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
better one so it says that the USB 3.0

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.000 
better one so it says that the USB 3.0
speed<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.260> 5.5<00:01:44.980> 1<00:01:45.490> 2<00:01:46.060> 0<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.920> megabits<00:01:47.920> per

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
speed is 5.5 1 2 0 and megabits per

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.440 
speed is 5.5 1 2 0 and megabits per
second<00:01:48.400> I<00:01:48.490> don't<00:01:48.550> know<00:01:48.730> what<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.030> means<00:01:49.270> then

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
second I don't know what that means then

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.600 
second I don't know what that means then
USB<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.620> basically<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:51.190> I<00:01:51.220> think<00:01:51.460> there's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
USB so basically there I think there's

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.970 
USB so basically there I think there's
like<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.970> 10<00:01:52.600> times<00:01:52.900> difference<00:01:53.410> between<00:01:53.860> the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
like a 10 times difference between the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:55.470 
like a 10 times difference between the
speeds<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.409> let's<00:01:56.620> just<00:01:56.800> open<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.250> up<00:01:57.430> now

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.220 

as<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.600> can<00:02:56.720> see<00:02:58.210> this<00:02:59.210> is<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.630> place<00:02:59.870> for<00:03:00.080> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
as you can see this is the place for the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.270 
as you can see this is the place for the
man<00:03:00.470> yard<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:03.770> built<00:03:04.100> quality<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:07.100> know<00:03:07.190> was

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
man yard the built quality you know was

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.950 
man yard the built quality you know was
a<00:03:07.340> really<00:03:07.580> plastic<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.210> guys<00:03:08.390> completed<00:03:08.810> this

one this is felt a really solid but it's
metal<00:03:12.110> piece<00:03:12.260> broke<00:03:12.530> down<00:03:12.770> but<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.280> can

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
metal piece broke down but as you can

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.930 
metal piece broke down but as you can
see<00:03:16.750> blew<00:03:17.750> me<00:03:18.650> top<00:03:18.920> which<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.310> USB<00:03:19.820> 3.0<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.820> I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
see blew me top which is USB 3.0 and I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.820 
see blew me top which is USB 3.0 and I
got<00:03:23.090> that's<00:03:23.270> about<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.990> still<00:03:24.290> have<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.590> try

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
got that's about it I still have to try

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.620 
got that's about it I still have to try
it<00:03:24.890> out<00:03:25.270> but<00:03:26.270> overall<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:27.050> looks<00:03:27.080> solid<00:03:27.650> but

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
it out but overall it looks solid but

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.740 
it out but overall it looks solid but
looks<00:03:29.630> plastic<00:03:30.200> II<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.710> don't<00:03:31.040> think<00:03:31.510> if<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
looks plastic II I don't think if the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.820 
looks plastic II I don't think if the
last<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.380> long<00:03:33.620> but<00:03:33.950> messy<00:03:34.940> hunkers<00:03:35.830> so

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
last that long but messy hunkers so

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.790 
last that long but messy hunkers so
there<00:03:36.980> you<00:03:37.100> have<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.580> quick<00:03:37.640> memory

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800
