in this location we could not get grass

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.990 
in this location we could not get grass
to<00:02:37.090> grow<00:02:37.299> at<00:02:37.600> all<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:39.040> sugar<00:02:39.400> maple<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
to grow at all the this sugar maple the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.509 
to grow at all the this sugar maple the
very<00:02:40.239> large<00:02:40.510> tree<00:02:40.810> above<00:02:41.049> it<00:02:41.230> was<00:02:41.799> casting<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
very large tree above it was casting a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.720 
very large tree above it was casting a
very<00:02:43.000> dense<00:02:43.269> shade<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.900> was<00:02:44.050> dry<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.830> probably

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
very dense shade it was dry and probably

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.300 
very dense shade it was dry and probably
the<00:02:46.030> roots<00:02:46.269> had<00:02:46.540> raw

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the roots had raw

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.270 
the roots had raw
the<00:02:47.610> soil<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.970> whatever<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.620> grass<00:02:49.860> might

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the soil of whatever the grass might

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.120 
the soil of whatever the grass might
have<00:02:50.459> needed<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.630> sedge<00:02:51.930> which<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> good

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
have needed so the sedge which is a good

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.400 
have needed so the sedge which is a good
drought<00:02:53.459> tolerant<00:02:54.030> plant<00:02:54.300> will<00:02:54.750> take<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
drought tolerant plant will take the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.979 
drought tolerant plant will take the
dense<00:02:55.650> shade<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:57.180> fill<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.599> a<00:02:57.630> little

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
dense shade it will fill in a little

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.320 
dense shade it will fill in a little
more<00:02:58.290> fully<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.760> only<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.150> its

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
more fully but this is only in its

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.710 
more fully but this is only in its
second<00:03:00.810> year<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.880> we<00:03:02.880> think<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.450> will<00:03:03.690> be

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
second year and we think that it will be

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.770 
second year and we think that it will be
a<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:04.019> good<00:03:04.380> substitute<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.780> conditions

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
a very good substitute for conditions

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.470 
a very good substitute for conditions
where<00:03:06.989> grass<00:03:07.290> just<00:03:07.620> won't<00:03:07.890> grow<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.330> I've

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
where grass just won't grow so if I've

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.420 
where grass just won't grow so if I've

made the decision to get rid of some lon

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.330 
made the decision to get rid of some lon
one<00:03:12.300> option<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.989> course<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.290> chemicals<00:03:14.010> but

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
one option of course is chemicals but

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
this project was probably our largest

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.860 
this project was probably our largest
one<00:04:22.049> for<00:04:22.470> removing<00:04:22.950> grass<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:24.479> was<00:04:24.660> about

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
one for removing grass and it was about

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.950 
one for removing grass and it was about
an<00:04:25.080> acre<00:04:25.229> but<00:04:26.070> what<00:04:26.280> we've<00:04:26.430> done<00:04:26.669> here<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:27.180> a

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
an acre but what we've done here is a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.140 
an acre but what we've done here is a
wildflower<00:04:28.500> meadow<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.760> it's<00:04:29.940> something

wildflower meadow and it's something

wildflower meadow and it's something
that<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:31.740> course<00:04:32.010> is<00:04:32.250> it's<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.700> long
