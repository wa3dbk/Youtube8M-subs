00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 time for new question friday and so on 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.420
 Welcome this week this 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.490
 it's about how I get to all 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.019
 all the pdf files for this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 download the poison 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.609
 have fun with many of you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.590
 keep asking me how georg 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.119
 I come to the pdf files of those 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.769
 you in the video you speak also in the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.590
 always shows videos and so on 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.960
 I'm coming to what I have to do where to find 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.720
 I give us a very simple answer 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.300
 there is always on youtube if you 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.640
 in video there is a video under the video 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 video description so a little info 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 box this but always closed it and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 you can easily do it with a mouse click 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.760
 just open 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.930
 and there is such a huge text of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.219
 me in there, I always write a few 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 nice lines too 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 motivation with pure and so on and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.739
 find there in this motivation text 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 give you the link to the corresponding 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.100
 pdf files just stop you in the video 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 pointer I love what's in the hand too 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.820
 have something to print and you just 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.329
 Also a gift to make you something 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 give 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 and that's why there is always one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.810
 pdf file for that and should be the lesson 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.240
 times do not consist of a video then 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.090
 is there either by e-mail the pdf link 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 or directly after the order if you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.920
 just kind of ordered a course 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.390
 or soja that is clear anyway but the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 on the left you can either find what you said 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.610
 under the video or simply in the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.500
 If you have an e-mail address 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.150

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.600
