00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
smell it and I don't like it so it's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.500 
smell it and I don't like it so it's
just<00:03:30.150> hard<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.140> one<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:32.330> still<00:03:33.330> got

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
just hard is this is one that still got

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.729 
just hard is this is one that still got
me<00:03:33.690> stumped<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.590> know<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> don't<00:03:35.250> know<00:03:35.400> if

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
me stumped you know I don't know if

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.520 
me stumped you know I don't know if
that's<00:03:37.739> why<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> middle<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:40.110> but<00:03:40.440> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that's why it's in the middle so but it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.229 
that's why it's in the middle so but it
does<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> little<00:03:41.220> bit<00:03:41.430> better<00:03:41.610> as<00:03:41.970> it

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
does get a little bit better as it

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.560 
does get a little bit better as it
progresses<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:44.000> guess<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.180> really<00:03:45.209> just

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
progresses so I guess it's really just

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.170 
progresses so I guess it's really just
the<00:03:46.170> first<00:03:46.470> half<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.610> life<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:48.030> this

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
the first half of the life of this

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.140 
the first half of the life of this
fragrance<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.840> bit<00:03:49.050> that<00:03:49.850> it's<00:03:50.850> kind<00:03:51.090> of

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
fragrance but it bit that it's kind of

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.610 
fragrance but it bit that it's kind of
iffy<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.510> me<00:03:52.100> now<00:03:53.100> my<00:03:53.250> second<00:03:53.700> favorite<00:03:54.090> is

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
iffy for me now my second favorite is

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.520 
iffy for me now my second favorite is
Avignon<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.910> it's<00:03:57.120> probably<00:03:57.540> what<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:58.080> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
Avignon and it's probably what is the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.890 
Avignon and it's probably what is the
most<00:03:58.739> talked<00:03:59.040> about<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.519> series<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.330> this

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
most talked about of the series and this

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.780 
most talked about of the series and this
is<00:04:01.049> based<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.709> Catholic<00:04:02.010> priests<00:04:02.519> of

Avignon in the South of France and this
is<00:04:06.420> like<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.260> me<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> simplest

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
is like the to me this is the simplest

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.830 
is like the to me this is the simplest
and<00:04:09.570> most<00:04:09.810> linear<00:04:10.290> fragrance<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.250> series
