00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.839
 and then by teams 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello very good everyone here who does not see 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.320
 commenting and well this that you are 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.960
 seeing is one against one of those 612 in 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.019
 the ground map in the xbox 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.699
 the truth is that I do not know I have a 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.070
 time playing the team to tell us 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:28.980
 if you are going to improve the connection yes 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.040
 and it gives us a lot of difference 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.829
 the truth is that it shows that a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.200
 little bit better the connection in the equipment 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.660
 in modern warfare 3 it's not just about 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.010
 exaggerating with an equal amount bales 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.379
 because it was much more noticeable in modern 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 warfare 2 is twice as much better in the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.380
 teams that is plate here in this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.210
 I play either 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.300
 it shows as much as 2 but good 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.730
 it is also noticeable 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.329
 yesterday I'm watching a trailer of a 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.329
 fat trailer that went out with him 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.920
 do not 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.130
 I was watching a video with the sniper 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.810
 I think it was in the channel of france I'm 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.890
 very sure yes 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 I do not know the truth that surprised me 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.930
 little because I did not expect that word 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.080
 when it could be used it could be 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.570
 make beans as a thing 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.340
 the harassment could not be worth 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.870
 better me so much that they take days we can 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.510
 follow the month I bless you both 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.070
 weeks to the first you could take a 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.940
 patch such but it does not look like that 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.950
 but good 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.190
 I had not booked it yet but what 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.190
 reserve why 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.290
 he was not seeing anymore 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.040
 the part of gameplay that you saw in the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.380
 change comes from the franc 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 I have also seen I think another job 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.680
 out there games paints well paints well 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.680
 and they do not know what 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.510
 that they were now working hard 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.670
 in the game has worked double or the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.420
 triple of people who are normally 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.420
 to make a game 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.970
 but I think that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.920
 what is going to come out that will know good 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.819
 well another thing I wanted to tell you 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.159
 what 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.719
 is that I have as many people as I have 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.030
 so much time with the computer that 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:30.569
 I could render I have a lot of 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.849
 I have got gameplays from facebook 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.510
 Search and destroy launch area 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.819
 since death I do not know how to tell you that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.459
 like more than you like more to see what 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.640
 you prefer that you play up now that now 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.690
 that I have time and I have his example 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.880
 is going to accumulate over time 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.380
 upload everything I have but good 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.730
 I will try to climb at least the best 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.730
 games of a 15 0 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:08.150
 I'm going to kill either but I do not think that 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.150
 the prestige of prestige 1 2 0 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.450
 I was thinking that I have many 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.540
 games also from the launch 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:21.770
 and that some killed 40 50 55 that was going to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.770
 upload those tricks 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.780
 and I say that Stopes 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.780
 launch are very boring 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.620
 there are people who like it but not 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.800
 I go all the time with forty and 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.800
 fifty 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.400
 is what I play every day either 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.020
 he thanks me very much I do not like it 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.990
 a lot to see it later but good 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.460
 the videos that you upload are not supposed to 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.200
 you have to like you too 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.690
 that will leave the launch and it bores me 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.850
 little when it's a lot always game 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.080
 He always plays by clips and I do not know 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.670
 see it then a whole game does not 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.340
 a little more than many thanks but it 's 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.470
 that if I put the pieces 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.580
 if I play for example 10 or 15 games and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.459
 I put chunks so this bone gusts and 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.489
 that already right away when I upload it there 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.769
 some imbecile who would not comment on putting 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.680
 an assembly shit since I wait 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.540
 male that is not a montage I think it's 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.400
 the chunks of is like a summary of what 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.889
 of the last games that played 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.310
 why not to get so bored 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.150
 but good 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.410
 there are times I had one and there are glasses 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.410
 piggy from my shot on the disk 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.970
 campa and killed him with the franc also 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.550
 Well I hope you tell me there in the 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.740
 comments that you always like to see 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.270
 more and seek and destroy been death or 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.250
 launch area I do not know anything we'll see 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.520
 in the next video up here has been 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.520
 90 is like if you want 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.620
