00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
redesign of the pilots watch it's a very

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
redesign of the pilots watch it's a very
interesting<00:01:23.580> design<00:01:23.939> actually<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.750> I'm<00:01:24.840> not

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
interesting design actually now I'm not

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.969 
interesting design actually now I'm not
going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.259> into<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> history<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
going to go into the history of it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to go into the history of it
because<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> noticed<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.850> recent<00:01:27.240> forum

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
because I noticed a recent forum

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390 
because I noticed a recent forum
discussion<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> history<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> 144

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
discussion about the history of the 144

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.749 
discussion about the history of the 144
in<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.850> sort<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> case<00:01:30.720> style<00:01:31.079> design<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
in this sort of case style design but it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.190 
in this sort of case style design but it
was<00:01:32.790> basically<00:01:33.240> done<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> very<00:01:33.990> very

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
was basically done to be very very

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.010 
was basically done to be very very
ergonomic<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.100> let<00:01:35.909> me<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.000> reflect<00:01:36.509> turn

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
ergonomic and let me just reflect turn

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
ergonomic and let me just reflect turn
it<00:01:37.140> around<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.470> bit<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
it around a bit so you can just have a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.520 
it around a bit so you can just have a
good<00:01:39.270> look<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.720> case<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.290> really

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
good look at this case because it really

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
good look at this case because it really
is<00:01:40.650> interesting<00:01:41.270> now<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.390> hold<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.899> on

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
is interesting now I just hold it on

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
is interesting now I just hold it on
that<00:01:43.170> profile<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that profile so you can see that you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
that profile so you can see that you
sort<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> watching<00:01:45.299> cased<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
sort of have the watching cased in a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.010 
sort of have the watching cased in a
sort<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.909> how<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.479> calling<00:01:48.869> this

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
sort of how can I think of calling this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.069 
sort of how can I think of calling this
it's<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.890> sort<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.659> mounting<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it's a sort of like a mounting if you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's a sort of like a mounting if you
like<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> watch<00:01:52.590> movement<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.130> case<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
like the watch movement is in case of a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.300 
like the watch movement is in case of a
mounting<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.030> quite<00:01:54.270> organic<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.930> smooth

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
mounting and quite organic and smooth

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.649 
mounting and quite organic and smooth
I'm<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> give<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.700> some<00:01:56.850> diameters<00:01:57.450> now

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I'm going to give you some diameters now

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.030 
I'm going to give you some diameters now
because<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.530> important

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
because I think that's really important

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.850 
because I think that's really important
but<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.430> 41<00:02:00.420> millimeter<00:02:00.990> diameter<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but it's 41 millimeter diameter it's a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.730 
but it's 41 millimeter diameter it's a
41<00:02:02.310> across<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:04.020> lug<00:02:04.229> width<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
41 across here the lug width for the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
41 across here the lug width for the
band<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> strap<00:02:05.880> length<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.450> 20

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
band so the strap length here is 20

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.059 
band so the strap length here is 20
millimeter<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.409> there's<00:02:07.560> lots<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> choice

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
millimeter so there's lots of choice

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.760 
millimeter so there's lots of choice
there<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:08.520> I'll<00:02:08.670> go<00:02:08.819> into<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.239> minute

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
there which I'll go into in a minute

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.230 
there which I'll go into in a minute
the<00:02:10.160> thickness<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.790> 14.5<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.140> usual<00:02:12.710> sort<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the thickness is 14.5 so usual sort of

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.580 
the thickness is 14.5 so usual sort of
cronograph<00:02:14.240> thickness<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.200> movement

got a 12-hour counter for the
chronograph<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.490> on<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.120> left<00:05:11.360> here<00:05:11.660> you

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
chronograph and on the left here you

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.140 
chronograph and on the left here you
have<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.169> running<00:05:12.590> time<00:05:12.919> seconds<00:05:13.669> which

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
have the running time seconds which

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.520 
have the running time seconds which
basically<00:05:14.539> is<00:05:14.780> linked<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.289> watch

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
basically is linked to the watch

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.379 
basically is linked to the watch
movement<00:05:16.070> so<00:05:16.520> that's<00:05:16.669> always<00:05:16.910> going<00:05:17.210> around

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
movement so that's always going around

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.260 
movement so that's always going around
without<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.410> chronograph<00:05:18.800> running<00:05:19.070> around
