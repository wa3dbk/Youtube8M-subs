with a new one as you can see the design

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
with a new one as you can see the design
is<00:01:27.090> nearly<00:01:27.659> identical<00:01:27.900> except<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.130> few

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

things first of all when I lay it on top
you'll<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.150> Ridge<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> little

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you'll see that this Ridge is a little

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.200 
you'll see that this Ridge is a little
bit<00:01:33.990> taller<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> mention<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> new<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
bit taller not to mention the new one is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
bit taller not to mention the new one is
thicker<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.350> has<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.770> heat<00:01:38.009> feature<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
thicker and it has this heat feature on

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
thicker and it has this heat feature on
there<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.570> too<00:01:39.750> sure<00:01:39.960> how<00:01:39.990> well<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
there now I'm not too sure how well this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
there now I'm not too sure how well this
heatsink<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.340> gonna<00:01:41.549> work<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.090> hey<00:01:42.329> anything

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
heatsink is gonna work but hey anything

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.749 
heatsink is gonna work but hey anything

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
this groove goes over that screw right

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
this groove goes over that screw right
there<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> motor<00:02:00.960> mount<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.920> just

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
there on the motor mount and I'm just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.330 
there on the motor mount and I'm just
gonna<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.430> ahead<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.030> slide<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:04.340> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
gonna go ahead and slide that on and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.910 
gonna go ahead and slide that on and
then<00:02:06.210> once<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.719> place<00:02:06.930> I'm<00:02:07.350> gonna<00:02:07.560> push

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
then once it's in place I'm gonna push

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.669 
then once it's in place I'm gonna push
it<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.629> since<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.440> motor

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it down now you can see since this motor

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.470 
it down now you can see since this motor
plate<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.489> thicker<00:02:11.790> I'm<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> have

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
plate is a bit thicker I'm going to have

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.820 
plate is a bit thicker I'm going to have
to<00:02:12.629> readjust<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.260> pinion

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to readjust the pinion

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
to readjust the pinion
to<00:02:14.100> push<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:15.150> bit<00:02:15.330> more<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
to push it out a little bit more in that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.380 
to push it out a little bit more in that
way<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.470> more<00:02:16.650> meshed<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> spur<00:02:17.880> gear

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
way it's more meshed in with a spur gear

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.330 
way it's more meshed in with a spur gear
now<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> pinion<00:02:19.500> gear<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.890> lined<00:02:20.190> up

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
now that the pinion gear is lined up

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.010 
now that the pinion gear is lined up
with<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.520> spheric<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.360> need<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
with a spheric here I need to have the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.110 
with a spheric here I need to have the
perfect<00:02:22.530> spacing<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.160> between<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.700> two

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
perfect spacing in between the two

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.820 
perfect spacing in between the two
it<00:02:24.420> can't<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.110> tight<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.440> they're

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
it can't be so tight that they're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.380 
it can't be so tight that they're
grinding<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.610> can't<00:02:26.820> be<00:02:26.940> too<00:02:27.150> loose

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
grinding but it can't be too loose

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.540 
grinding but it can't be too loose
otherwise<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.260> strip<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.740> plastic<00:02:29.280> spur

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
otherwise it will strip the plastic spur

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.850 
otherwise it will strip the plastic spur
gear<00:02:29.850> but<00:02:30.360> once<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.990> spacing<00:02:31.500> right<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
gear but once I get that spacing right I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.890 
gear but once I get that spacing right I
can<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.220> ahead<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.610> reinsert<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.450> screw<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
can go ahead and reinsert the screw that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.540 
can go ahead and reinsert the screw that
holds<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.320> motor<00:02:34.470> plate<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.070> motor<00:02:35.280> mount

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
holds the motor plate to the motor mount

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.850 
holds the motor plate to the motor mount
and<00:02:35.790> finally<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> last<00:02:36.780> step<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.380> putting<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and finally the last step is putting the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
and finally the last step is putting the
gear<00:02:38.040> cover<00:02:38.280> back<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.150> attaching<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> with

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
gear cover back on and attaching it with

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
gear cover back on and attaching it with
that<00:02:40.380> one<00:02:40.440> screw<00:02:41.540> here's<00:02:42.540> before<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.640> here<00:02:44.640> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that one screw here's before and here is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.810 
that one screw here's before and here is
after<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:46.140> have<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.470> admit<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.040> does<00:02:47.280> look<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
after I have to admit it does look a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.270 
after I have to admit it does look a
little<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.270> better<00:02:48.510> either<00:02:49.260> way<00:02:49.620> thank<00:02:50.160> you

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
little bit better either way thank you
