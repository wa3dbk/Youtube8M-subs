00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.600
 well the theater is full and today is 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.749
 sunken ctico maría esther contanos what 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.990
 what is good this good a 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:14.259
 didactic is a function in which I 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.030
 I'm explaining what it consists of 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.310
 first instance what is a class 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.400
 of classical dance for what it serves us each 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.550
 exercise and I try to be noticed that 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.160
 everything is correlative that they are growing 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.810
 in speed in complexity of the steps 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.939
 and how the kids go 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.610
 preparing first take first and 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.350
 taken from the bar and then going to 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.239
 do all the exercises without the help 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.760
 of any bra that is what 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.480
 leads to them being in conditions 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.070
 to take on more and more complex things 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 that would be more complex things 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.960
 example the classical dance variations 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.640
 that the goal of doing the classes of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.430
 dance is to prepare the dancers 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.739
 to take on what a choreographer or a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.180
 director trust us that we can 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.910
 develop 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.050
 in this case what we are going to see at the level 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.610
 of variations of classical dance is going to be 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.650
 the second variation of the fairies of 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.560
 sleeping beauty 'the variation of age 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.300
 of temperament after the for 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.690
 cater of the lake that is a piece 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.760
 extremely difficult that soloists do 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.860
 in the ballet companies and in this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.110
 case in the girls that assume this 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.460
 challenge are the fourth-year girls or 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.610
 be that we are very proud that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.440
 they can do it really well to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.440
 this is because it is a very complex thing 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.840
 then we have a whole picture that 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.600
 belongs to the first act of Don Quixote 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.690
 that the picture of the bullfighters is where 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.540
 involved the level boys and the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.000
 males of intermediate and advanced level 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.590
 the girls of the sixth year and some 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 seventh and eighth grade students 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.920
 and then we have the variation of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 basilio also of Don Quixote after 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.579
 let's make a small sample of 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.399
 contemporary we have two works of 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.979
 contemporary that guys do 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.950
 of the initial level of males and sixth 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.340
 Year of women and advanced level males 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 and seventh and eighth year and after a 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.260
 surprise maría esther with these 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 didactic that already has us 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 accustomed the dance seminar of the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.769
 theater and that they achieve in society or in 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 the schools that come many schools 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.819
 I believe that what we achieved in the first 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.040
 instance is to know about what it is 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.349
 the career of the dancer who is a 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.510
 career that starts at a very early 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.390
 age 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.189
 I want me is my intention to be 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.470
 value and that you respect the 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.299
 guys who study classical dance because 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.269
 their career they initiate to the 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.099
 nine ten years when a career 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.049
 usually starts at 18 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.629
 then they from very young 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.090
 assume a series of responsibilities 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:02.090
 a behavior that takes a lot of tenacity 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.480
 many have to take a career of 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.159
 much demand then it is my intention 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.170
 that will be announced that they see 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.230
 how a dancer develops that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.260
 see that you enjoy dancing and that 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.420
 know the theater to be something visual and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.310
 to be something in which where there is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.549
 guys is very attractive to the public 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.970
 see little children from young children to 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.459
 teenagers and young people as they love 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.099
 this discipline and how they are led to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.290
 After all, I think that's what 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.900
 we aim and the public always 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.480
 he goes very happy and tell us 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.909
 think about doing other didactic 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 and if we plan to do other didactic and 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:50.030
 also the seminar also for 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.530
 participate in these theater days 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.640
 open they are called a day in the life 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.290
 of the theater with different 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.599
 different things for example the day 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.530
 On June 19 we will participate with a 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.390
 Mime work that is new and what 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.730
 we incorporated a mime workshop this year 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.730
