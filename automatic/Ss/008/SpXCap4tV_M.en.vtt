and<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.090> good<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.630> template

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and it's good to have a little template

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.890 
and it's good to have a little template
to<00:00:22.740> work<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:23.160> okay<00:00:23.359> let's<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.720> I've

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to work with okay let's just what I've

to work with okay let's just what I've
been<00:00:24.930> working<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> basic

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
been working with this is the basic

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.669 
been working with this is the basic
shape<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> boat<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.039> far<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
shape of the boat so far just the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.709 
shape of the boat so far just the
open-ended<00:00:31.730> rectangle<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
open-ended rectangle what we're going to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:45.650 
open-ended rectangle what we're going to
do<00:00:38.030> is<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> triangle<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> key<00:00:44.660> at

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
do is make a triangle so the key at

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660 
do is make a triangle so the key at
first<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.590> measure<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.430> base<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
first is just a measure from base to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
first is just a measure from base to
base<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.559> how<00:00:49.559> far<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:51.020> on<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> little

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
base here how far you got on this little

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.150 
base here how far you got on this little
template<00:00:52.800> I've<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.190> about<00:00:53.899> 14<00:00:54.899> inches<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> I'm

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
template I've got about 14 inches so I'm

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150 
template I've got about 14 inches so I'm
going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> split<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> difference<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:58.160> Mark

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
going to split the difference and Mark

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
going to split the difference and Mark
here<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.520> 7<00:00:59.969> inches<00:01:01.670> then<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
here at 7 inches then I'm going to just

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.660 
here at 7 inches then I'm going to just
pick<00:01:04.140> pick<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> number<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.549> make

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
pick pick a number that's going to make

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
pick pick a number that's going to make
a<00:01:05.700> nice<00:01:05.880> triangle<00:01:06.299> we're<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.470> back

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a nice triangle we're going to go back

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.730 
a nice triangle we're going to go back
let's<00:01:08.729> say<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:09.210> 12<00:01:09.900> inches<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:12.229> 12<00:01:13.229> inches

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
let's say about 12 inches and 12 inches

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:23.870 
let's say about 12 inches and 12 inches
and<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.250> draw<00:01:14.460> those<00:01:14.700> lines

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.090 

now<00:01:24.880> we<00:01:24.940> have<00:01:25.090> nice<00:01:25.300> triangle<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.890> going<00:01:26.950> to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
now we have nice triangle I'm going to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:36.480 
now we have nice triangle I'm going to
draw<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.340> line<00:01:27.610> connecting<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.330> two<00:01:35.430> now

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
draw the line connecting the two now

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.490 
draw the line connecting the two now
again<00:01:37.390> cutting<00:01:37.870> on<00:01:38.050> through<00:01:38.290> half<00:01:38.470> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
again cutting on through half the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060 
again cutting on through half the
cardboard

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.560 

this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> template<00:01:45.000> anyway<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:47.570> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this is just the template anyway so it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.709 
this is just the template anyway so it's
good<00:01:48.750> practice<00:01:49.759> as<00:01:50.759> well<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
good practice as well as this one you

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.240 
good practice as well as this one you
got<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> cut<00:01:52.170> through<00:01:52.319> this<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.679> to<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
got to cut through this one to get it to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.880 
got to cut through this one to get it to
bend<00:01:53.429> as<00:01:53.579> well<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:55.319> then<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.649> triangle<00:01:57.890> is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
bend as well and then this triangle is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
bend as well and then this triangle is
going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> end<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.610> going<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.719> way

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
going to end up going all the way

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.420 
going to end up going all the way
through<00:02:04.219> now<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.579> all<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:05.969> way<00:02:06.090> through

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:32.990 

okay<00:02:12.049> so<00:02:26.299> so<00:02:27.299> bend<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:30.319> then<00:02:31.910> bend<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
okay so so bend it up then bend the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.940 
okay so so bend it up then bend the
sides<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.840> small<00:02:37.140> cardboard<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:37.829> need

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
sides the small cardboard you don't need

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:47.000 
sides the small cardboard you don't need
a<00:02:37.980> crimp<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:45.829> lay<00:02:46.829> that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
a crimp and that's going to be lay that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.500 
a crimp and that's going to be lay that
on<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.340> inside

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.970 

that's<00:02:53.080> going<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.319> be<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.530> front<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.830> your
