00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hi, girls and boys who are 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.899
 watching this video 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 Today I'm going to teach you how to do a 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.470
 end if it 's not hard to do and I'm 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.880
 very cute is this one 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:26.039
 I threw shrapnel 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.970
 It happens from here so I'll put it in my 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.970
 nose make 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.760
 what is that way 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:48.690
 So let's start seeing you guys go. 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:56.140
 need nail pliers 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:01:01.360
 of a small wire of bread and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:04.390
 of a pencil sound of a pencil 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:10.600
 So let's go to start, you pick it up. 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:13.780
 the wire and goes slowly cutting the door 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 because otherwise it will break 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.440
 if you put too much force 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.440
 it will break it cuts a little bit and it pulls 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.610
 they were very good and know what it is then 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:34.960
 I want this way for you and you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 takes a girl who is already trying to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 maximum possible 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.810
 All kneaded desire but there is maximum 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.799
 possible to look beautiful 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.750
 get a pencil 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:56.289
 He's focusing on my face and he's spinning. 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.810
 the wire on the track is not in this format 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.869
 when you get this format you come with 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 pliers and cuts right here more or less 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:12.539
 is not going to cut if in theory 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.539
 a little bit and kind of vaccine show 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 and stay that way 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.370
 and how I paint - 15 as it already has a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 black and a paw I'm going to paint 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.990
 red with that permanent pen 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:37.660
 pilot you paint winning and to help 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.660
 Do you hold it with haiti drug pliers? 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:50.829
 it will be easier to paint everything safe 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:55.060
 with pilot pen and wondering if you 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.920
 have here so the lady for me for that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.439
 You want a black one, you buy one. 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.900
 black pen and a daughter black pen 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.569
 but since I already have silver or black I 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.519
 I'll even paint red to stay 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.859
 cute does not need to paint until it points 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.519
 You do not need to, because you're going to stay out. 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.519
 tip 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 so stay put, this way, wait. 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.569
 dry a little 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.610
 Are you recording? 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:41.150
 ready and waiting to dry a little and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.790
 you can hold it will already be a little getting 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.790
 Your hand there because I did not go through 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.790
 complete 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.390
 ready a pin to be painted and cute 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.710
 For you have already supplied in the sand 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 I hope to make the most of it. 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.110
 It will still come out in your hand because here 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.800
 It was a moment but if you catch her 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.490
 water she who is not dry will leave 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.180
 Look I did two on being red and 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.180
 I just did two reds. 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:30.300
 I'll put my nose put 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:35.700
 normal as just how to stick in the nose and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:39.780
 you adjusting kicked as cable in the area 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.930
 I have a clarity and you will 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.669
 putting it until it looks cute that I 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.669
 get out of here because it gets ugly 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:52.339
 You'll put a little 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:57.159
 inside so I do not stay that way and that way 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:57.159
 You know it's fake to be fake. 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.619
 I do not think the best and it stays that way. 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:11.659
 the brush 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:13.669
 I hope you have enjoyed yourself 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:18.279
