Chaudhary and Qualcomm and what we're

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.480 
Chaudhary and Qualcomm and what we're
showing<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.619> our<00:00:28.859> mobile<00:00:29.130> development

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
showing here is our mobile development

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.590 
showing here is our mobile development
platform<00:00:30.060> running<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> MSM<00:00:31.700> 8255<00:00:32.700> Snapdragon

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
platform running the MSM 8255 Snapdragon

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
platform running the MSM 8255 Snapdragon
mobile<00:00:33.870> processor<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:35.010> showing<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.340> variety

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
mobile processor we're showing a variety

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
mobile processor we're showing a variety
of<00:00:35.700> different<00:00:35.790> demos<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> stem<00:00:37.050> variant

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
of different demos on the stem variant

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.690 
of different demos on the stem variant
processor<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.399> looked

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
processor so if we looked

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.480 
processor so if we looked
we're<00:00:40.060> showing<00:00:40.840> first<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.800> video<00:00:42.040> decode

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
we're showing first is the video decode

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.520 
we're showing first is the video decode
ability<00:00:43.150> at<00:00:43.270> 720p<00:00:44.100> HD<00:00:45.100> video<00:00:45.930> decoding<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.290> the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
ability at 720p HD video decoding on the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.310 
ability at 720p HD video decoding on the
platform<00:00:47.980> itself<00:00:48.220> however<00:00:49.210> it's<00:00:49.390> also<00:00:49.540> hdmi

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
platform itself however it's also hdmi

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.569 
platform itself however it's also hdmi
out<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:50.680> if<00:00:50.800> you<00:00:50.890> look<00:00:51.040> up<00:00:51.250> here

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
out so if you look up here

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.819 
out so if you look up here
it's<00:00:53.629> showing<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> same<00:00:54.960> thing<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it's showing the same thing on the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's showing the same thing on the
screen<00:00:56.180> using<00:00:57.180> HDMI<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.769> actually

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
screen using HDMI out but it's actually

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.340 
screen using HDMI out but it's actually
two<00:00:59.339> different<00:00:59.570> images<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.839> look<00:01:00.960> back<00:01:01.140> on

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
two different images if you look back on

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.420 
two different images if you look back on
them<00:01:02.870> here<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.440> pause<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.159> can

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
them here when I pause it here i can

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
them here when I pause it here i can
overlay<00:01:05.880> different<00:01:06.270> controls<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
overlay different controls and have a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.220 
overlay different controls and have a
which<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.910> reflected<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.660> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> screen

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
which is not reflected up on the screen

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.980 
which is not reflected up on the screen
itself<00:01:10.440> so<00:01:11.190> I'll<00:01:11.370> go<00:01:11.550> ahead<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> pause<00:01:12.690> ahead

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
itself so I'll go ahead and pause ahead

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.830 
itself so I'll go ahead and pause ahead
start<00:01:13.290> there

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
start there

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.590 
start there
that's<00:01:14.380> really<00:01:14.649> showing<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:15.100> video<00:01:15.600> decoding

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
that's really showing a video decoding

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.130 
that's really showing a video decoding

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
the things that the MSM 8255 processor

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.600 
the things that the MSM 8255 processor
has<00:01:23.439> is<00:01:23.770> too<00:01:24.640> deep<00:01:24.789> or

for<00:01:51.179> Jesse<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:52.109> here<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> another

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
for Jesse and over here we have another

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
for Jesse and over here we have another
little<00:01:52.950> game<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.060> shows<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
little game that just shows you the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.919 
little game that just shows you the
performance<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.219> exactly<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.420> this

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
performance of this way exactly so this

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.130 
performance of this way exactly so this
actually<00:01:58.110> focuses<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.759> 3d<00:02:00.570> part<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
actually focuses more on the 3d part and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.870 
actually focuses more on the 3d part and
I'll<00:02:01.319> start<00:02:01.679> this<00:02:01.829> casual<00:02:02.280> game<00:02:02.490> called

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
I'll start this casual game called

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.749 
I'll start this casual game called
yellow<00:02:03.780> mellow

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.720 

we<00:02:10.179> start<00:02:10.539> here

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.410 

you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.209> see<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:16.050> very<00:02:16.290> rich<00:02:16.879> 3d<00:02:17.879> graphics

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
you can see the very rich 3d graphics

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.589 
you can see the very rich 3d graphics
that<00:02:18.659> you<00:02:18.840> could<00:02:19.019> develop<00:02:19.920> using<00:02:20.370> using<00:02:21.360> an

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
that you could develop using using an

the 3d GPU that's built into the

the 3d GPU that's built into the
Snapdragon<00:02:29.430> processors<00:02:30.030> actually<00:02:30.569> even<00:02:31.440> use

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
Snapdragon processors actually even use

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.550 
Snapdragon processors actually even use
that<00:02:32.160> from<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.910> kind<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.360> mobile<00:02:33.599> gaming<00:02:33.989> rig

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that from the kind of mobile gaming rig

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.330 
that from the kind of mobile gaming rig
right<00:02:35.120> Cambodia's<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:36.420> sony<00:02:36.840> PSP<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:38.069> mean<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
right Cambodia's or sony PSP I mean the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.190 
right Cambodia's or sony PSP I mean the
performance<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.000> amazing<00:02:39.480> absolutely<00:02:40.019> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
performance is amazing absolutely the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.470 
performance is amazing absolutely the
the<00:02:40.920> functionality<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.849> video<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the functionality of this video is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.699 
the functionality of this video is
equivalent<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:44.129> playstation<00:02:44.819> 3<00:02:45.090> level<00:02:45.709> wow

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
equivalent to a playstation 3 level wow

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.199 
equivalent to a playstation 3 level wow
that's<00:02:47.129> what<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.730> pretty<00:02:47.970> pretty

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
that's what it is is pretty pretty

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.420 
that's what it is is pretty pretty
high-end<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.870> last<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.530> least<00:02:49.590> again

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
high-end and last but not least again

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.369 
high-end and last but not least again
talking<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.209> video<00:02:51.540> capability<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.319> I

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
talking about video capability and I

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.949 
talking about video capability and I
think<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:52.829> are<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.340> 720p<00:02:54.060> plates<00:02:54.720> right

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
think these are for 720p plates right

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
think these are for 720p plates right
exactly<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:55.980> we're<00:02:56.489> looking<00:02:56.579> at<00:02:56.819> actually

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
exactly so we're looking at actually

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.150 
exactly so we're looking at actually
what<00:02:57.359> you're<00:02:57.480> looking<00:02:57.720> at<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:57.989> 720<00:02:58.680> third<00:02:58.890> or

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
what you're looking at is a 720 third or

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.449 
what you're looking at is a 720 third or
it<00:02:59.579> has<00:02:59.730> up<00:02:59.910> to<00:02:59.940> 17<00:03:00.780> 20<00:03:01.019> be<00:03:01.140> capability<00:03:02.069> or<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
it has up to 17 20 be capability or the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.729 
it has up to 17 20 be capability or the
subset<00:03:02.879> of<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.510> actually<00:03:04.290> looking<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
subset of that actually looking at a

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.000 
subset of that actually looking at a
subset<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.489> four<00:03:06.000> different<00:03:06.209> decodes

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
subset of four different decodes

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.650 
subset of four different decodes
happening<00:03:08.010> at<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.190> same<00:03:08.340> time<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:09.329> what<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
happening at the same time that what the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.119 
happening at the same time that what the
nice<00:03:09.810> thing<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.079> of<00:03:10.379> course<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.829> can<00:03:10.980> see

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
nice thing is of course as you can see

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.910
