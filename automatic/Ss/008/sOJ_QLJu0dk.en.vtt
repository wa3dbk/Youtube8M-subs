they really haven't had a good dose of

conservative treatment will try that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530 
conservative treatment will try that
because<00:01:35.040> most<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> time<00:01:35.909> even<00:01:36.180> people

need<00:01:46.350> conservative<00:01:47.100> treatment<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.060> ones<00:01:48.270> who

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
need conservative treatment the ones who

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
need conservative treatment the ones who
do<00:01:48.540> require<00:01:48.869> surgery<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:49.590> sit<00:01:50.070> down<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
do require surgery we then sit down and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.789 
do require surgery we then sit down and
explain<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.240> great<00:01:51.479> detail<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
explain to them in great detail the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.800 
explain to them in great detail the
risks<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.280> benefits<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.790> surgery<00:01:54.240> what

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
risks and benefits of that surgery what

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.480 
risks and benefits of that surgery what
are<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.140> our<00:01:55.350> primary<00:01:55.740> goals<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
are what are our primary goals in the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
are what are our primary goals in the
surgery<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.509> describe<00:01:57.899> with

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
surgery and then we describe with

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.920 
surgery and then we describe with
diagrams<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.009> atomic<00:01:59.280> models<00:01:59.930> exactly

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
diagrams and in atomic models exactly

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.060 
diagrams and in atomic models exactly
how<00:02:01.049> we're<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> surgery<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
how we're going to do the surgery and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.410 
how we're going to do the surgery and
then<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.250> go<00:02:02.369> through<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> detailed<00:02:02.790> discussion

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
then we go through a detailed discussion

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.910 
then we go through a detailed discussion
of<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> expect<00:02:04.020> after<00:02:04.560> surgery

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
of what they can expect after surgery

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.270 
of what they can expect after surgery
things<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.880> changed<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.810> radically<00:02:07.380> over

less<00:02:26.739> invasive<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:28.030> work<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.540> had<00:02:28.720> picked<00:02:28.989> up

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
less invasive at work I had picked up

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.420 
less invasive at work I had picked up
something<00:02:29.440> kind<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.800> heavy<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.450> ran

something kind of heavy and it it ran

something kind of heavy and it it ran
really<00:02:33.900> write<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.019> my<00:02:35.050> arm<00:02:35.290> right<00:02:35.560> up<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.340> my

really write up my arm right up to my
shoulder<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.239> thought<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> very<00:02:38.230> long

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
shoulder and I thought for a very long

shoulder and I thought for a very long
time<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.580> was<00:02:39.730> just<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.030> full<00:02:40.239> month<00:02:40.420> my

happened he there Jim he said yeah he

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.780 
happened he there Jim he said yeah he
said<00:02:52.560> looking<00:02:53.560> at<00:02:53.709> gmr<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.670> they're

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
said looking at gmr I and they're

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.759 
said looking at gmr I and they're
stealing<00:02:55.209> extremely<00:02:56.019> paints<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.470> would

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
stealing extremely paints that would

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.830 
stealing extremely paints that would
just<00:02:56.980> gonna<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.489> operate<00:02:57.819> ran<00:02:58.569> me

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
just gonna have to operate ran me

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.320 
just gonna have to operate ran me
through<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.560> procedure<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.790> was<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.269> to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
through the procedure and I was going to

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.610 
through the procedure and I was going to
work<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:03.549> mean<00:03:04.150> every<00:03:04.840> step<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
work and and I mean every step of the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.050 
work and and I mean every step of the
way<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.180> certainly<00:03:07.180> we<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:08.500> did<00:03:08.769> that<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
way and certainly we we did that as the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.620 
way and certainly we we did that as the
minute<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.260> was<00:03:11.440> done<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.700> next<00:03:13.000> day<00:03:13.239> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
minute that it was done the next day it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.300 
minute that it was done the next day it
was<00:03:13.660> like<00:03:14.579> no<00:03:15.579> pain<00:03:15.820> none<00:03:16.690> whatsoever<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:18.160> was

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
was like no pain none whatsoever it was

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.949 
was like no pain none whatsoever it was
like<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.670> day<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> half<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.570> was<00:03:19.750> out<00:03:19.900> of

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
like a day and a half and I was out of

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.380 
like a day and a half and I was out of
there<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:21.070> was<00:03:21.310> back<00:03:21.579> at<00:03:21.760> work<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.120> next

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
there and I was back at work to next

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.280 
there and I was back at work to next
week<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:25.120> been<00:03:25.329> doing<00:03:25.359> fine<00:03:25.930> ever<00:03:26.200> since

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
week and have been doing fine ever since

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.310 
week and have been doing fine ever since
I<00:03:26.769> think<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.790> most<00:03:28.030> important<00:03:28.959> thing<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.170> we

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
I think the most important thing that we

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.750 
I think the most important thing that we
do<00:03:29.760> as<00:03:30.760> surgeons<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.930> as<00:03:32.109> physicians<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.829> is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
do as surgeons and as physicians is is

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.599 
do as surgeons and as physicians is is
making<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.810> correct<00:03:35.200> diagnosis<00:03:35.950> we<00:03:36.400> can

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
making a correct diagnosis we can

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.520 
making a correct diagnosis we can
maximize<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.359> chance<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:37.750> helping<00:03:37.989> them<00:03:38.350> if

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
maximize the chance of helping them if

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.130 
maximize the chance of helping them if
they<00:03:39.040> eventually<00:03:39.310> need<00:03:39.700> surgery<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.930> think

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
they eventually need surgery and I think

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.660 
they eventually need surgery and I think
that's<00:03:41.290> important<00:03:41.799> that's<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:42.040> very<00:03:42.220> important

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
that's important that's a very important

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.710 
that's important that's a very important
to<00:03:42.790> know<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:44.320> we<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> lot<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> physicians

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
to know so we have a lot of physicians

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.539 
to know so we have a lot of physicians
12<00:03:46.720> or<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.140> physicians<00:03:47.380> who<00:03:47.980> will<00:03:48.100> be<00:03:48.280> under

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
12 or so physicians who will be under

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.460 
12 or so physicians who will be under
one<00:03:48.700> roof<00:03:49.000> who<00:03:49.660> will<00:03:49.780> be<00:03:49.870> able<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.200> offer

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
one roof who will be able to offer

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.860
