00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.180
 or rather music at the end of each round 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.900
 we will need any ready romance even 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.159
 stupidly downloaded 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.990
 site go 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.990
 and everywhere signatory of Donets homo dons 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.329
 plugin skripchenko 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.119
 we go skripchenko 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.119
 if we open through notebook 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.659
 we see 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.640
 we have cases 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.450
 cases 1 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.600
 Kiev 2 53 Kiev 4 case 5 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 next is Putin mp3 play sound 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.380
 folder name which contains 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 musk year and a warehouse 2001 conspiracy 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.559

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.280
 contribution 2001 c1 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.100
 You can make your name for example 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.150
 place of treasure 1001 network call them 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.160
 mp3 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 here we wrote mp3 it can be copied 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.090
 is inserted 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 etc 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 let's see what we get 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840
 and so on 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.120
 but to change the name of the melody here 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.320
 we have the name of the melody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and so 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.790
 Further 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.280
 for the club place we also write here though 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 for example come in 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.970
 So hereâ€™s an example. 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 so 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.550
 and so on 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.410
 Naturally in return here for 2001 mun. 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.209
 also prescribed n 3 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 since we have changed everything should 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.949
 how does he say so 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.819
 the same 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.699
 mp3 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.119
 here too mp3 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.819
 a meeting 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.819
 here he is 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.449
 if rub 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.549
 Bug reports 1000 1 out of 9 heat 2011 10 for 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.599
 this place we write went 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.889
 since we decided that we have every thread 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.579
 will be called called 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.119
 but if the name is the same 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.869
 just come in come in and so forth 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.609
 then we won't have it so we 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.689
 put next to the number 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.249
 next to the name 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.990
 cut come in for example 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.990
 put the cut number 1 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.939
 four 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.849
 6 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.979
 eight 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.979
 personalities and 10 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.270

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.929
 10 aces 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.619
 if we look at any source below 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.099
 again we will have 10 cresses 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.249
 Actis dependencies so much and will 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.699
 sliced 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.349
 we have here 10 m 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.599
 and here are the quiet 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.069
 and here we will have 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.069
 two price is sharp these cases corrected 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.709
 same type correct these 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.449
 uncorrected case 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.839
 here will be with us 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.999
 for the place of the treasure 1001 cleaved 5 mp 3 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.199
 here we will have for example come in 1 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.799
 sochi 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.439
 here 12 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.439
 come in here 13 14 and so on 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.739
 we fill all this in the same chip as 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.859
 Ottawa 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.749
 and now we have a look below then y 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:05.429
 we will be common 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:07.049
 cases 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.819
 that is, if we already 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.529
 stupidly all renamed 5 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.199
 next will be here 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.699
 mp3 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.819
 and here will come 20 th 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.940
 only here we are no longer separated 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.650
 into groups 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.670
 how here 10 here 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.259
 both here and now 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.569
 and here it's all two at once all day 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.969
 in the same way we them them 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.180
 rename 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.270
 further save 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.800
 Thales is not enough 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.819
 and interests and we need to get 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.529
 plug-in x 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.740
 for this we 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.969
 open any Slovaks 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.499
 there is a term in it 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.229
 we go and don them look 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.080
 skripchenko 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.610
 open tailoring 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.569
 and there are addition scripts 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.389
 which we changed 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.389
 the guarantor of sandu here we have them 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.949
 put them in a skripchenko folder 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.789
 I drive servers and squeeze this and 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.360
 transfer to a set of X's Khimki 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.229
 Here is the icon 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.699
 and here we will 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.719
 the plugin itself will appear a folder 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.240
 sets 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.499
 if everything will be good 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.129
 how from us here 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.770
 then he will 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.889
 if e is written here 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.620
 then there were errors 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.409
 and close it 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:29.819
 all is well 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.749
 press exit 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.049
 that is, we have already got a plan, but 

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:36.770
 closer to the play stream 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.770
 here he rum himself there they igso 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.379
 we need 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.240
 the price is sharply determined by me 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.240
 for this we create a folder with the word 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.680
 the folder we decided to squeak tindi wrote mp3 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.469
 I will create popcorn patrin 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.030
 and every tune 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.210
 renamed come in dust come in 1 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.210
 For example 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.800
 children 1 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.229
 here we got come in 1 will be here 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.199
 output 2 3 and so on 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.389
 and then everything 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.379
 hitting to investigate 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:18.360
 thank you all bye
