workers<00:00:34.730> everywhere<00:00:34.969> through<00:00:35.929> the<00:00:36.019> work<00:00:36.199> that

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
workers everywhere through the work that

the<00:00:38.870> policies<00:00:39.379> that<00:00:39.559> will<00:00:39.649> be<00:00:39.800> required<00:00:40.219> to

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the policies that will be required to

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.200 
the policies that will be required to

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
achieve that vision of scale you might

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.729 
achieve that vision of scale you might
wonder<00:00:44.420> with<00:00:44.749> all<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.050> needs<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.409> face

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739

low-wage<00:00:46.550> workers<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.300> families<00:00:47.690> that

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
low-wage workers and families that

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.689 
low-wage workers and families that
struggle<00:00:48.289> why<00:00:48.469> there's<00:00:48.739> such<00:00:48.949> a<00:00:48.980> focus<00:00:49.519> on

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
struggle why there's such a focus on

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.270 
struggle why there's such a focus on
assets<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.569> I<00:00:51.409> guess<00:00:51.679> I<00:00:51.800> probably<00:00:52.010> don't<00:00:52.159> need

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
assets and I guess I probably don't need

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.700 
assets and I guess I probably don't need
to<00:00:52.429> tell<00:00:52.609> this<00:00:52.819> group<00:00:53.179> why<00:00:53.690> assets<00:00:54.170> matter<00:00:54.409> but

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
to tell this group why assets matter but

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.319 
to tell this group why assets matter but
I<00:00:54.739> wanted<00:00:55.069> to<00:00:55.129> just<00:00:55.339> say<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.609> few<00:00:55.879> words<00:00:55.940> about

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
I wanted to just say a few words about

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.799 
I wanted to just say a few words about
that<00:00:57.109> in<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.319> context<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.129> our<00:00:58.339> work<00:00:58.670> if<00:00:59.600> you

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.229 
that in the context of our work if you
really<00:01:00.440> look<00:01:00.589> at<00:01:00.679> upward<00:01:01.010> mobility

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239

throughout the history of the United

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.859 
throughout the history of the United
States<00:01:03.109> it's<00:01:03.649> not<00:01:03.829> about<00:01:04.129> getting<00:01:05.000> income<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
States it's not about getting income and

people who are working poor and to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.080 
people who are working poor and to
create<00:01:18.020> new<00:01:18.380> cycles<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:18.979> prosperity<00:01:19.549> that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
create new cycles of prosperity that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.749 
create new cycles of prosperity that
travel<00:01:20.539> across<00:01:20.780> generations<00:01:21.219> you<00:01:22.219> can't<00:01:22.520> do

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
travel across generations you can't do

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.940 
travel across generations you can't do
that<00:01:22.969> unless<00:01:23.299> you're<00:01:23.780> focused<00:01:24.259> on<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.500> assets

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
that unless you're focused on the assets

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.499 
that unless you're focused on the assets
that<00:01:25.070> have<00:01:25.130> proven<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.759> create<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.240> sort<00:01:26.479> of

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
that have proven to create that sort of

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.359 
that have proven to create that sort of
prosperity<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.710> middle<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.039> upper-income

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
prosperity for middle and upper-income

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.690 
prosperity for middle and upper-income
families<00:01:28.579> and<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.960> some<00:01:30.200> ways<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.549> not

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
families and so in some ways this is not

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.690 
families and so in some ways this is not
a<00:01:32.079> revolutionary<00:01:33.079> idea<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.009> it's<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.219> radical

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
a revolutionary idea but it's a radical

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.639 
a revolutionary idea but it's a radical
approach<00:01:34.969> to<00:01:35.359> something<00:01:35.750> that's<00:01:35.960> really<00:01:36.439> at

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
approach to something that's really at

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.469 
approach to something that's really at
the<00:01:36.740> heart<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:37.039> American<00:01:37.549> economic<00:01:38.030> values

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
and our work at its heart is about

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.700 
and our work at its heart is about
restoring<00:01:41.359> integrity<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.020> opportunity<00:01:42.619> to

work there are often a lot of questions
about<00:01:52.369> exactly<00:01:52.909> how<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.270> make<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:53.810> happen<00:01:53.869> it

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
about exactly how we make this happen it

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.620 
about exactly how we make this happen it
sounds<00:01:54.679> like<00:01:54.859> such<00:01:55.609> a<00:01:55.640> challenging<00:01:56.299> thing<00:01:56.600> to

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630

and<00:03:30.180> that's<00:03:30.569> how<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> savings<00:03:31.440> works<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.190> so

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
and that's how the savings works and so

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.939 
and that's how the savings works and so
this<00:03:33.419> is<00:03:33.569> just<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.169> nuts<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.500> bolts<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.889> what

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
this is just the nuts and bolts of what

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.420 
this is just the nuts and bolts of what
we<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:37.079> important<00:03:37.620> part<00:03:37.799> though<00:03:38.069> are<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
we do the important part though are the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.420 
we do the important part though are the
outcomes<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:39.180> since<00:03:39.750> 2002<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.769> think<00:03:41.099> despite

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
outcomes and since 2002 I think despite

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.470 
outcomes and since 2002 I think despite
people<00:03:44.430> who<00:03:44.549> thought<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:45.180> would<00:03:45.329> never

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
people who thought that this would never

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.210 
people who thought that this would never
happen<00:03:45.780> because<00:03:46.019> we<00:03:46.319> really<00:03:46.620> got<00:03:46.769> rolling<00:03:46.949> in

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
happen because we really got rolling in

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.280 
happen because we really got rolling in
a<00:03:47.280> recession<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.180> been<00:03:48.449> stunned<00:03:48.959> at<00:03:49.169> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
a recession we have been stunned at the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.530 
a recession we have been stunned at the
level<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.650> success<00:03:49.889> we've<00:03:50.310> seen<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.269> think

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
level of success we've seen and I think

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.479 
level of success we've seen and I think
that<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.750> people<00:03:51.870> we<00:03:52.139> serve<00:03:52.169> have<00:03:52.590> bolide<00:03:52.980> so

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
that the people we serve have bolide so

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.250 
that the people we serve have bolide so
many<00:03:53.699> of<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:53.970> stereotypes<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.780> preconceived

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
many of the stereotypes and preconceived

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.289 
many of the stereotypes and preconceived
notions<00:03:55.709> we<00:03:55.829> have<00:03:56.040> about<00:03:56.639> what<00:03:56.879> people<00:03:57.209> can

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
notions we have about what people can

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.360 
notions we have about what people can
achieve<00:03:57.449> and<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.049> lesson<00:03:58.440> about<00:03:58.530> what

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
achieve and it's a lesson about what

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.550 
achieve and it's a lesson about what
people<00:03:59.730> can<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.780> give<00:04:00.989> them<00:04:01.199> the<00:04:01.230> tools

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
people can do if you give them the tools

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.589 
people can do if you give them the tools
when<00:04:02.489> they<00:04:02.579> already<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.209> strength<00:04:03.510> to

community I mean this is when i talked
about<00:04:40.770> our<00:04:40.980> desire<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.280> do<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.670> at<00:04:41.850> scale

about our desire to do this at scale
2,000<00:04:43.050> families<00:04:43.200> is<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.560> small<00:04:43.950> number<00:04:44.310> but

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
2,000 families is a small number but

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.730 
2,000 families is a small number but
we've<00:04:44.610> leveraged<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.420> know<00:04:45.540> many<00:04:46.290> millions

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
in the form of mortgages and so our

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.880 
in the form of mortgages and so our
vision<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.480> understand<00:04:52.020> how<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.230> add<00:04:52.410> zeros

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
to this I'm going to come back to this

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.250 
to this I'm going to come back to this
question<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.910> how<00:04:57.090> people<00:04:57.480> are<00:04:57.690> actually<00:04:57.900> able

to buy homes because some of you are

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.180 
to buy homes because some of you are
probably<00:05:00.660> wondering<00:05:00.870> how<00:05:01.380> folks<00:05:01.680> really<00:05:01.920> make

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
probably wondering how folks really make

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.170 
probably wondering how folks really make
it<00:05:02.340> work<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.730> you're<00:05:02.850> going<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.030> hear

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
it work and you're going to hear

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.760 
it work and you're going to hear
directly<00:05:03.420> from<00:05:03.660> some<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.080> our<00:05:04.170> savers<00:05:04.590> will

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
directly from some of our savers will

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.590 
directly from some of our savers will
answer<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.130> question<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:06.030> thought<00:05:06.480> I'd

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
answer that question but I thought I'd

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.200 
answer that question but I thought I'd
just<00:05:06.660> cover<00:05:07.050> some<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.440> basics<00:05:07.500> as<00:05:07.980> well<00:05:08.220> we

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
just cover some of the basics as well we

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.880 
just cover some of the basics as well we
really<00:05:09.450> provide<00:05:09.900> people<00:05:10.290> with<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.650> tools

different sorts of choices when they're

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.940 
different sorts of choices when they're
catalyzed<00:05:57.480> with<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:57.990> possibility<00:05:58.680> of<00:05:58.710> owning

a home and for so many people this is
just<00:06:01.140> felt<00:06:01.290> impossible<00:06:01.670> but<00:06:02.670> suddenly

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
just felt impossible but suddenly

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.760 
just felt impossible but suddenly
there's<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.600> chance<00:06:03.900> and<00:06:04.140> people<00:06:04.440> make<00:06:04.590> all

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
there's a chance and people make all

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.310 
there's a chance and people make all
sorts<00:06:05.040> of<00:06:05.220> different<00:06:05.280> choices<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:06.320> really

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
sorts of different choices and really

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.830 
sorts of different choices and really
powerful<00:06:07.740> things<00:06:07.950> begin<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.310> happen<00:06:08.630> we<00:06:09.630> also

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840
