00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 how to keep geraniums 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 ivy geraniums or geraniums donald 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.490
 when there is little or no room in his 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.490
 apartment 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 for that you will use a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 planter or a big pot you go 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.450
 fill with potted soil or rhenium 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 universal potting it does not have much 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.740
 of importance and it will allow you 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 to keep alive your 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 geraniums during the winter now 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 we will move on to the preparation of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 our geraniums so it's all about 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 geraniums that were torn out of a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 gardener so in the rough 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.260
 we still see her flowers her leaves 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 and we're going to cut branches a few 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.239
 centimeters above the neck is then 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.699
 the advantage is that there is no more 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 so flaws more sick leaves and 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.080
 we will also reduce the roots 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 for proportioned the roots by 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:56.940
 compared to the big changes this is our 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.739
 our ivy is ready if a little bit of 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.839
 rotten leaves or rotten critters 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.110
 we remove all that to have absolutely 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.299
 no decay I cut a small 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 little roots and we're going to them 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.420
 plant directly in the planter 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.490
 that will allow you to tighten them to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.450
 maximum proof group 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:25.860
 hop on s nothing I cut the roots 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.660
 hop hop hop and I plant during the winter 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 its geraniums we will be able to store them 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.130
 in a place you have little room 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.770
 a little bit seem if you wish in 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.750
 a garage in your apartment if you 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 wish there you have a little bit of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.380
 place more or no light since a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.730
 no leaf is not very annoying 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.750
 just when the leaves you 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.700
 started to grow 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.970
 we'll have to bring them more 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.710
 light you water little or not at all 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 during the winter because there is no 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.740
 leaf you will start to their 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.200
 bring a little water when they 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.300
 will begin to develop and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.310
 spring when they are going to be a little 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.830
 little more in sheets you to extract them 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.510
 all her geraniums from your planters 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 you have hotpot and you will do 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.310
 your potting in pots and in 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.769
 planters with a good potting soil 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.750
 geraniums and you'll put them out 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.959
 when the frosts will no longer be 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.959
 to fear
