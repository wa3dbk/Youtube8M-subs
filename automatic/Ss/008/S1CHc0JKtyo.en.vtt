00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
are two ways you can do it you can have

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.710 
are two ways you can do it you can have
someone<00:02:25.580> tank<00:02:26.580> blue<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.239> him<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.599> entire

someone tank blue for him the entire

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080 
someone tank blue for him the entire
time<00:02:27.989> which<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.099> what<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.310> recommend<00:02:29.700> that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
time which is not what I recommend that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.330 
time which is not what I recommend that
let<00:02:30.750> someone<00:02:30.959> go<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> Lane<00:02:31.410> really<00:02:31.800> gimped<00:02:32.160> or

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
let someone go to Lane really gimped or

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.809 
let someone go to Lane really gimped or
you<00:02:32.670> can<00:02:32.790> do<00:02:32.880> what<00:02:33.000> I'm<00:02:33.090> doing<00:02:33.120> here<00:02:33.750> which<00:02:34.470> is

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
you can do what I'm doing here which is

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.970

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
constantly switching direction this lets

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.020 
constantly switching direction this lets
rammus<00:02:42.480> hit<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.220> whole<00:02:44.489> time<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:46.170> you

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
rammus hit it the whole time with you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.030 
rammus hit it the whole time with you
technically<00:02:48.030> tanking<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.599> creep<00:02:48.900> aggro<00:02:49.290> now

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
technically tanking the creep aggro now

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.360 
technically tanking the creep aggro now
it's<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.299> easy<00:02:51.540> technique<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.190> can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it's a very easy technique and you can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.120 
it's a very easy technique and you can
do<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:53.730> pretty<00:02:54.150> much<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.810> any<00:02:55.440> character<00:02:55.980> as

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
do it pretty much on any character as

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.120 
do it pretty much on any character as
long<00:02:56.310> as<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.549> have<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> ranged<00:02:57.329> ability<00:02:58.130> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
long as you have a ranged ability and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.800 
long as you have a ranged ability and
and<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.610> really<00:02:59.880> helps<00:03:00.269> your<00:03:00.390> jungler<00:03:00.599> out<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
and it really helps your jungler out a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.380 
and it really helps your jungler out a
lot<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.260> can't<00:03:01.560> do<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.640> extended<00:03:03.209> leash

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
lot now you can't do the extended leash

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.160 
lot now you can't do the extended leash
all<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.049> time<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.569> extended<00:03:06.989> leash

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
all the time because the extended leash

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
all the time because the extended leash
I<00:03:07.410> mean<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.769> saw<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> Israel<00:03:08.489> go<00:03:08.670> back<00:03:08.880> to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
land there he missed three creeps that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.180 
land there he missed three creeps that
can<00:03:11.069> mean<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> lot<00:03:11.329> but<00:03:12.329> as<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.630> support<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:14.010> a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
can mean a lot but as a support it is a

can mean a lot but as a support it is a
very<00:03:14.639> good<00:03:14.760> idea<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:16.079> help<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.440> jungler<00:03:16.709> out

like that and you still go to lane at

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.530 
like that and you still go to lane at
full<00:03:19.410> hip<00:03:19.590> points<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.040> mean<00:03:20.250> there's<00:03:20.430> there's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
a little bit of experience now that

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.970 
a little bit of experience now that
leash<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.340> just<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.120> very<00:03:30.480> easy<00:03:30.810> technique<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
leash is just a very easy technique that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.460 
leash is just a very easy technique that
anyone<00:03:32.609> can<00:03:32.880> learn<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.540> by<00:03:33.630> practicing<00:03:34.350> it

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
anyone can learn just by practicing it

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.240 
anyone can learn just by practicing it
in<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.850> custom<00:03:36.239> game<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:37.200> hit<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.739> once<00:03:37.950> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
in in a custom game you hit it once and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.199 
in in a custom game you hit it once and
then<00:03:39.060> every<00:03:39.810> time<00:03:40.250> golem<00:03:41.250> changes<00:03:41.940> which

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
then every time golem changes which

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.870 
then every time golem changes which
direction<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:42.930> running<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:44.010> change<00:03:44.549> which

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
direction it's running you change which

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.420 
direction it's running you change which
direction<00:03:45.269> you're<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.920> golem<00:03:47.310> is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
direction you're going so if golem is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.520 
direction you're going so if golem is
going<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.120> you're<00:03:48.720> going<00:03:49.079> up<00:03:49.260> then<00:03:49.440> you

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
going up and you're going up then you

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.440 
going up and you're going up then you
start<00:03:49.799> running<00:03:49.920> down<00:03:50.100> until<00:03:50.819> golem<00:03:51.150> starts

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
start running down until golem starts

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.000 
start running down until golem starts
running<00:03:51.720> down<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.470> wait<00:03:52.620> till<00:03:52.829> gone

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
running down then you wait till gone

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.500 
running down then you wait till gone
gets<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.549> unreleased<00:03:53.819> range<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.389> run

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
gets the unreleased range then you run

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.289 
gets the unreleased range then you run
back<00:03:54.660> up<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.139> it's<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.190> simple<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.060> makes

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
back up and it's so simple and it makes

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.839 
back up and it's so simple and it makes
the<00:03:57.569> jungle<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.829> so<00:03:59.579> smooth<00:04:00.060> now<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.819> said

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
the jungle so so smooth now like I said
