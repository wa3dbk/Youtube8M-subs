already done one video on this but I

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
already done one video on this but I
didn't<00:00:11.130> think<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.429> was<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.550> great<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.300> test

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
didn't think it was that great of a test

didn't think it was that great of a test
on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> green<00:00:13.200> screen<00:00:13.490> just<00:00:14.490> because<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.880> had

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
on the green screen just because I had

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.300 
on the green screen just because I had
the<00:00:15.420> settings<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.590> used<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> settings

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the settings off I used the settings

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.429 
the settings off I used the settings
that<00:00:17.460> were<00:00:17.580> came<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> box<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:18.750> came<00:00:19.020> that

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
that were came with the box or came that

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.580 
that were came with the box or came that
came<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:21.090> believe<00:00:21.630> were<00:00:21.840> 30<00:00:22.260> frames

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
came with which I believe were 30 frames

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.290 
came with which I believe were 30 frames
or<00:00:22.769> 60<00:00:23.010> frames<00:00:23.220> per<00:00:23.310> second<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.029> had<00:00:24.269> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
or 60 frames per second and had a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.359 
or 60 frames per second and had a
wide-angle<00:00:24.570> setting<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> looks<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
wide-angle setting so it looks like a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.339 
wide-angle setting so it looks like a
big<00:00:26.880> setting<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> don't<00:00:27.630> feel<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
big setting and I don't feel like it

anything<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.680> purely<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.030> GoPro

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
anything this is purely off of the GoPro

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
anything this is purely off of the GoPro
audio<00:01:40.320> source<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
audio source and I don't have it in the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.289 
audio source and I don't have it in the
case<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> waterproof<00:01:44.790> case<00:01:45.030> because

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
case like the waterproof case because

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.550 
case like the waterproof case because
that<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> blocks<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.079> sound<00:01:46.320> although

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that kind of blocks the sound although

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.109 
that kind of blocks the sound although
they<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> backing<00:01:47.579> plate<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:48.030> on

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
they do have a backing plate you put on

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
they do have a backing plate you put on
that<00:01:48.149> allow<00:01:48.509> sound<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.770> little

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that allow sound go in and out a little

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
that allow sound go in and out a little
bit<00:01:50.399> better<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.689> right<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.920> set

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
bit better so right now we have it set

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.270 
bit better so right now we have it set
to<00:01:53.130> 1080p<00:01:53.850> 30<00:01:54.390> frames<00:01:54.750> per<00:01:54.869> second<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> we're

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
to 1080p 30 frames per second and we're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
to 1080p 30 frames per second and we're
on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> narrow<00:01:56.759> settings<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.450> got<00:01:57.630> rid<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
on the narrow settings so we got rid of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.920 
on the narrow settings so we got rid of
the<00:01:58.549> widescreen<00:01:59.549> this<00:02:00.060> camera<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.540> literally

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the widescreen this camera is literally

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.300 
the widescreen this camera is literally
like<00:02:01.110> two<00:02:01.290> feet<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.649> front<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:02.070> whereas

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
like two feet in front of me whereas

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
like two feet in front of me whereas
before<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.180> four<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:03.570> five<00:02:03.750> feet

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
before it was about four or five feet

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
before it was about four or five feet
back<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.829> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.219> zoom<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
back so we kind of to zoom in on the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.680 
back so we kind of to zoom in on the
footage<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.329> made<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.810> look<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.770> great

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
footage which made it look not as great

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.290 
footage which made it look not as great
so<00:02:09.690> anyways<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.340> thing<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.700> would<00:02:11.760> say<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so anyways the one thing I would say it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.559 
so anyways the one thing I would say it
still<00:02:12.569> does<00:02:12.840> kind<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
still does kind of have a

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.979 
still does kind of have a
to<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.489> as<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.760> see<00:02:15.999> when<00:02:16.299> I<00:02:16.329> on<00:02:16.719> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
to it so as you can see when I on the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.000 
to it so as you can see when I on the
green<00:02:17.170> screen<00:02:17.319> you're<00:02:17.499> plugging<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.859> need<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
green screen you're plugging in need a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.229 
green screen you're plugging in need a
bigger<00:02:18.280> green<00:02:18.549> screen<00:02:18.879> cuz<00:02:18.999> you're<00:02:19.090> probably

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
bigger green screen cuz you're probably

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.349 
bigger green screen cuz you're probably
singing<00:02:19.540> my<00:02:19.629> hand<00:02:20.019> going<00:02:20.739> off<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.489> side

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
singing my hand going off of the side

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.179 
singing my hand going off of the side
right<00:02:22.659> now<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.810> I'm<00:02:23.079> like<00:02:23.260> literally<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.980> feel

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
right now and I'm like literally I feel

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.559 
right now and I'm like literally I feel
like<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> little<00:02:24.519> t-rex<00:02:24.969> here<00:02:25.090> around<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
like a little t-rex here around in the

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.569 
like a little t-rex here around in the
box<00:02:25.810> because<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.290> don't<00:02:26.469> have<00:02:26.620> very<00:02:27.249> much<00:02:27.340> room

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
box because I don't have very much room

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.330 
box because I don't have very much room
now<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.060> guess<00:02:28.389> I<00:02:28.510> could<00:02:28.900> move<00:02:29.200> farther<00:02:29.889> back

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
now I guess I could move farther back

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.869 
now I guess I could move farther back
closer<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.780> screen<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.879> would

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
closer to the screen and that would

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.309 
closer to the screen and that would
actually<00:02:34.299> give<00:02:34.510> me<00:02:34.750> more<00:02:35.590> room<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:38.170> then<00:02:38.290> I

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
actually give me more room but then I

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.720 
actually give me more room but then I
got<00:02:38.590> there<00:02:38.739> with<00:02:38.859> my<00:02:38.980> lighting<00:02:39.310> around<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.609> see

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
got there with my lighting around to see

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.009 
got there with my lighting around to see
see<00:02:39.909> there's<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> shadow<00:02:40.329> on<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.599> green<00:02:40.870> screen

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
see there's a shadow on the green screen

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.830 
see there's a shadow on the green screen
now<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:42.909> moving<00:02:43.269> farther<00:02:43.510> away<00:02:43.689> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
now but and I'm moving farther away I

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.319 
now but and I'm moving farther away I
have<00:02:44.319> less<00:02:44.530> room<00:02:44.829> so<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.489> guess<00:02:45.669> I<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.939> move<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
have less room so I guess I can move the

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.940 
have less room so I guess I can move the
lighting<00:02:46.659> around<00:02:46.750> if<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.139> wanted<00:02:47.409> to<00:02:47.469> move<00:02:47.829> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
lighting around if I wanted to move the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.770 
lighting around if I wanted to move the
GoPro<00:02:48.250> closer<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.849> screen<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.329> just<00:02:49.599> get<00:02:49.750> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
GoPro closer to the screen or just get a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.990 
GoPro closer to the screen or just get a
bigger<00:02:50.049> screen<00:02:50.669> anyways<00:02:51.669> this<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:51.969> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
bigger screen anyways this is the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.759 
bigger screen anyways this is the
quality<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.719> I<00:02:52.750> hope<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.079> guys<00:02:53.230> enjoyed<00:02:53.560> this
