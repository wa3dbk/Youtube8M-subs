all the way down to the minimum as you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.479 
all the way down to the minimum as you

see here the camera picks up nothing

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.090 
see here the camera picks up nothing

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.240 
whatsoever but if you switch them all
the<00:03:59.250> way<00:03:59.370> up<00:03:59.750> it<00:04:00.750> obviously<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.680> max<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the way up it obviously to the max it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.370 
the way up it obviously to the max it
obviously<00:04:02.609> will<00:04:02.819> bring<00:04:03.030> up<00:04:03.180> more<00:04:03.720> noise<00:04:03.959> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
obviously will bring up more noise and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.000 
obviously will bring up more noise and
you<00:04:04.620> see<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.889> levels<00:04:05.220> are<00:04:05.370> very<00:04:05.609> very<00:04:05.940> high

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
you see the levels are very very high

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.710 
you see the levels are very very high
