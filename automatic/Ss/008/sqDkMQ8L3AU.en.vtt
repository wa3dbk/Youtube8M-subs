00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
numbers show up in terms of attack

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
numbers show up in terms of attack
damage<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.850> sometimes<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.509> shoot

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
damage you know sometimes when you shoot

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
damage you know sometimes when you shoot
an<00:01:39.869> enemy<00:01:39.960> there's<00:01:40.320> white<00:01:40.560> numbers<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
an enemy there's white numbers and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.469 
an enemy there's white numbers and

sometimes when you shoot um there's
yellow<00:01:42.720> numbers<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.259> critical<00:01:43.799> damage

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
yellow numbers that's critical damage

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
yellow numbers that's critical damage
that's<00:01:44.520> basically<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.149> precision<00:01:45.840> shots

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that's basically like precision shots

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.889 
that's basically like precision shots
now<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> hundred<00:01:47.460> class<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
now I have a hundred class right now so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
now I have a hundred class right now so
I<00:01:48.960> got<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> sniper<00:01:49.619> rifle<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> loot

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
I got the sniper rifle from the loot

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
I got the sniper rifle from the loot
crate<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.360> first<00:01:51.689> intro<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
crate in the very first intro to the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.889 
crate in the very first intro to the
game<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.360> easier<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.840> me

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
game so it's a little bit easier for me

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
game so it's a little bit easier for me
to<00:01:54.930> get<00:01:55.079> headshots<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.280> sure

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to get headshots right here I'm not sure

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.130 
to get headshots right here I'm not sure
