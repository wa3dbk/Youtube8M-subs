statue which is pre spawned and anything

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.270 
statue which is pre spawned and anything
else<00:00:11.280> that's<00:00:11.639> around<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.179> ok<00:00:13.080> first<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> all

else that's around you ok first of all

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.849 
else that's around you ok first of all
you<00:00:14.670> need<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.480> basics<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.590> all

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
you need to know the basics of what all

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.710 
you need to know the basics of what all
the<00:00:17.010> stuff<00:00:17.279> means<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.449> we're<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the stuff means so if we're going to

the stuff means so if we're going to
remove<00:00:18.990> object<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.279> got<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.490> learn<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.820> all

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
remove object you got to learn what all

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.120 
remove object you got to learn what all
this<00:00:21.060> stuff<00:00:21.270> means<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.680> means<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
this stuff means so what this means is a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.099 
this stuff means so what this means is a
pretty<00:00:23.279> much<00:00:23.430> world<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> world<00:00:24.660> file

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
pretty much world so for the world file

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.740 
pretty much world so for the world file
or<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> world<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.250> general<00:00:26.750> remove

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
or just for the world in general remove

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.769 
or just for the world in general remove
object<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:29.189> remove<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> world<00:00:30.300> object

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
object and then remove the world object

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.229 
object and then remove the world object
and<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> ID<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.059> too

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and this is the ID I'm not really too

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.500 
and this is the ID I'm not really too
sure<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.910> direction<00:00:36.120> it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
sure what that is the direction it's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.990 
sure what that is the direction it's
facing<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.110> whether<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.500> north<00:00:37.710> south<00:00:38.640> east

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
facing so whether it's north south east

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.139 
facing so whether it's north south east
west<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:40.230> something<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
west or something like that then I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
west or something like that then I
thinking<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> 4<00:00:43.020> i'm<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.800> too<00:00:43.890> sure<00:00:43.920> on

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
thinking up to 4 i'm not too sure on

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.229 
thinking up to 4 i'm not too sure on
that<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.379> cords<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> x<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.940> cords

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that and then the cords of x the cords

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.799 
that and then the cords of x the cords
of<00:00:48.329> y<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> cords<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> z<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> down

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
of y and then the cords of z up and down

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
of y and then the cords of z up and down
so<00:00:51.809> pretty<00:00:51.960> much<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.590> even<00:00:52.770> too<00:00:53.129> sure<00:00:53.160> why

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so pretty much I'm not even too sure why

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.180 
so pretty much I'm not even too sure why
that<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.670> either<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.270> leave<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
that as either so just leave how it is

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
that as either so just leave how it is
but<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> remove<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.270> statue<00:00:57.570> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
but say you want to remove the statue in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
but say you want to remove the statue in
game<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.680> no<00:00:58.859> idea<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> find<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
game and you have no idea how to find it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
game and you have no idea how to find it
out<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.629> could<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> could<00:01:01.170> right

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
out what you could do is you could right

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.100 
out what you could do is you could right
click<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.370> called<00:01:02.850> statue<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.899> then

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
click it see it's called statue and then

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.590 
click it see it's called statue and then
go<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.619> object<00:01:04.769> ID<00:01:05.309> database<00:01:05.729> such<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.270> this

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
go to an object ID database such as this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.070 
go to an object ID database such as this
and<00:01:06.840> type<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.380> statu<00:01:08.510> one<00:01:09.510> problem<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and type in statu one problem with this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
and type in statu one problem with this
is<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> million<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.369> statues<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
is you get a million and one statues so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.560 
is you get a million and one statues so
it<00:01:12.930> could<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.260> any<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.619> these<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.880> any

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it could be in any of these and then any

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
it could be in any of these and then any
of<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:15.810> any<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.250> go

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
of these any of these you have to go

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
of these any of these you have to go
through<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:18.090> trying<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.659> by

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
through all of them trying them out by

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.490 
through all of them trying them out by
going<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.799> object<00:01:20.810> 745<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:21.840> whatever<00:01:22.350> one

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
going like object 745 or whatever one

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280 
going like object 745 or whatever one
was<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.820> hoping<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> spawns<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
was and then hoping that it spawns the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
was and then hoping that it spawns the
right<00:01:25.500> object<00:01:25.670> another<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.090> can

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
right object another thing that you can

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
right object another thing that you can
do<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.890> made<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> little

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
do and that I use is I made a little

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940 
do and that I use is I made a little
code<00:01:29.700> an<00:01:29.909> object<00:01:30.299> handler<00:01:30.659> after<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> click

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
code an object handler after the click

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.730 
code an object handler after the click
one<00:01:32.600> interface<00:01:33.600> where<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> says<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> debugger

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
one interface where it says the debugger

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.580 
one interface where it says the debugger
and<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> by<00:01:36.720> default<00:01:36.960> zenith

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then all this is by default zenith

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.969 
and then all this is by default zenith
and<00:01:37.770> Zenith<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.600> lot<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.930> log<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.770> this

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
and Zenith it's a lot of log so on this

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.859 
and Zenith it's a lot of log so on this
if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.299> click<00:01:42.600> an<00:01:42.720> object<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.829> say<00:01:44.869> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
if you click an object it will say it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.149 
if you click an object it will say it
will<00:01:46.049> give<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.520> clicked<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.759> object<00:01:48.270> ID<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
and if you don't know if she's across y

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.850 
and if you don't know if she's across y
to<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.780> sky<00:03:10.520> get<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.330> then<00:03:12.810> Z<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.470> just

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
to the sky get it and then Z it is just

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.100 
to the sky get it and then Z it is just
up<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.160> down<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.700> up<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.180> down<00:03:15.300> depending<00:03:15.810> on

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
up and down so up and down depending on

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.710 
up and down so up and down depending on
what<00:03:16.230> level<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.530> are<00:03:16.560> 0<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.580> ground<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.210> think

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
what level you are 0 is ground I think

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.900 
what level you are 0 is ground I think
three<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.020> Max<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:20.430> don't<00:03:20.580> even<00:03:20.670> know<00:03:20.820> what

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
three is Max and I don't even know what

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.660 
three is Max and I don't even know what
the<00:03:21.000> region's<00:03:21.390> do<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.830> ignore<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.190> crap

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
the region's do so just ignore that crap

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.120 
the region's do so just ignore that crap
so<00:03:24.210> what<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.020> need<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.410> need<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.680> X<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> Y

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
so what you need is you need the X the Y

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.940 
so what you need is you need the X the Y
and<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> Z<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.120> then<00:03:27.240> not<00:03:27.420> object<00:03:27.720> ID<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.770> once

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and the Z and then not object ID so once

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.500 
and the Z and then not object ID so once
you've<00:03:29.100> got<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.280> going<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.790> npc<00:03:30.180> spawning

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
you've got that going to npc spawning

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
you've got that going to npc spawning
and<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.950> bottom<00:03:32.160> copy<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.730> out

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
and then go to the bottom copy it out

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.850 
and then go to the bottom copy it out
I'll<00:03:33.210> copy<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.690> code<00:03:33.900> if<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.590> don't<00:03:34.740> have

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
I'll copy this code if you don't have

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.060 
I'll copy this code if you don't have
this<00:03:35.040> code<00:03:35.310> then<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:36.090> don't<00:03:36.900> know<00:03:36.960> just<00:03:37.380> copied

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
this code then I don't know just copied

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.250 
this code then I don't know just copied
off<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.310> screen<00:03:38.580> or<00:03:39.270> type<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:39.870> yourself

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
off the screen or type it out yourself

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.470 
off the screen or type it out yourself
like<00:03:41.040> I've<00:03:41.220> said<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.300> last

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
like I've said and I think the last

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.970 
like I've said and I think the last
video<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.350> copy<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.620> paste<00:03:43.709> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
video I like to just copy and paste the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.560 
video I like to just copy and paste the
code<00:03:44.100> as<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.610> easier<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.270> it's<00:03:45.420> not

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
code as it's easier but it's not

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.000 
code as it's easier but it's not
actually<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> best<00:03:45.930> way<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.170> learn<00:03:46.380> if<00:03:46.890> you

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
actually the best way to learn if you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.440 
actually the best way to learn if you
want<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.220> learn<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.700> stuff<00:03:47.970> without<00:03:48.150> just

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
want to learn the stuff without just

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.240 
want to learn the stuff without just
copying<00:03:48.690> pasting<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.830> need<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.100> actually

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
copying pasting it you need to actually

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.760 
copying pasting it you need to actually
learn<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:51.030> whole<00:03:51.180> world<00:03:51.510> with<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.900> capital<00:03:52.080> dot

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
learn the whole world with a capital dot

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.820 
learn the whole world with a capital dot
remove<00:03:53.100> capital<00:03:53.730> camelcase<00:03:54.270> remember<00:03:54.900> object

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
remove capital camelcase remember object

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.530 
remove capital camelcase remember object
and<00:03:56.130> then<00:03:56.280> world<00:03:56.580> opportunity<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.090> dat<00:03:57.330> yeah

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
and then world opportunity I dat yeah

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.020 
and then world opportunity I dat yeah
but<00:03:58.440> anyway<00:03:58.680> after<00:03:59.459> you've<00:03:59.550> done<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.730> go

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
but anyway after you've done that go

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.980 
but anyway after you've done that go
half<00:04:00.540> screen<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.080> half<00:04:01.230> screen<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:02.390> then<00:04:03.390> get

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
half screen and half screen and then get

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.800 
half screen and half screen and then get
the<00:04:04.140> object<00:04:04.440> ID<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.070> already<00:04:05.190> have<00:04:05.459> two

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
the object ID like we already have two

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.150 
the object ID like we already have two
2355<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.709> you're<00:04:07.910> objecting<00:04:09.860> in<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.980> two

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
2355 so you're objecting in the two

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.690 
2355 so you're objecting in the two
brackets<00:04:11.520> here<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.780> ID<00:04:12.990> so<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.550> good

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
brackets here is the ID so it's good

the ID to whatever idea is to
2<00:04:27.810> 3<00:04:28.320> 5<00:04:29.130> 5<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.880> then<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.870> don't<00:04:30.990> know<00:04:31.080> what<00:04:31.170> that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
2 3 5 5 and then I don't know what that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.040 
2 3 5 5 and then I don't know what that
is<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.560> I'll<00:04:32.070> get<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.310> cords<00:04:32.870> or<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
is and I'll get the cords or the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.130 
is and I'll get the cords or the
coordinates<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.800> should<00:04:34.980> see<00:04:35.160> which<00:04:35.850> are<00:04:36.140> 3795

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
coordinates I should see which are 3795

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.230 
coordinates I should see which are 3795
so<00:04:37.530> change<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:37.920> one<00:04:38.100> three<00:04:38.730> seven<00:04:38.880> nine<00:04:39.060> five

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
so change this one three seven nine five

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.150 
so change this one three seven nine five
two<00:04:39.900> eight<00:04:40.620> four<00:04:41.100> four<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.630> then<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.900> eid<00:04:43.890> is

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
two eight four four and then the eid is

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.700 
two eight four four and then the eid is
zero<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.700> that's<00:04:45.270> good<00:04:45.510> then<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.020> save<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.410> and

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
zero so that's good then you save it and

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.220 
zero so that's good then you save it and
also<00:04:46.950> say<00:04:47.190> remove<00:04:47.610> object<00:04:48.120> which<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:48.810> what<00:04:49.110> we

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
also say remove object which is what we

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.110 
also say remove object which is what we
want<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:50.070> then<00:04:50.220> after<00:04:50.490> you've<00:04:50.580> done<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:50.790> go

so we did something wrong I think maybe

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.960 
so we did something wrong I think maybe
the<00:05:45.030> era's<00:05:45.450> made<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.810> so<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.050> didn't<00:05:46.290> work

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
the era's made it so it didn't work

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
I mean I fixed my ear is except for that

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.270 
I mean I fixed my ear is except for that
one<00:05:58.200> which<00:05:58.470> I<00:05:58.530> don't<00:05:58.680> actually<00:05:58.830> know<00:05:59.070> what<00:05:59.190> it

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
one which I don't actually know what it

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.760 
one which I don't actually know what it
is<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.640> don't<00:05:59.790> know<00:05:59.910> what<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.120> API<00:06:00.840> or<00:06:00.960> duplicated

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
is I don't know what a API or duplicated

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.010 
is I don't know what a API or duplicated
API<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.280> because<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.640> don't<00:06:02.820> know<00:06:02.940> Java<00:06:03.180> but<00:06:03.960> I

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
API is because I don't know Java but I

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.080 
API is because I don't know Java but I
fixed<00:06:04.320> all<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.650> errors<00:06:04.919> and<00:06:05.280> now<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.700> statue

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
fixed all the errors and now the statue

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.210 
fixed all the errors and now the statue
disappeared<00:06:06.750> so<00:06:07.380> we<00:06:07.500> did<00:06:07.650> actually<00:06:07.770> do<00:06:08.100> it

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
disappeared so we did actually do it

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.980 
disappeared so we did actually do it
right<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:08.669> was<00:06:08.790> just<00:06:09.000> because<00:06:09.150> we<00:06:09.480> had<00:06:09.690> some

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
right it was just because we had some

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.490 
right it was just because we had some
errors<00:06:10.500> in<00:06:10.669> our<00:06:11.669> MPC<00:06:12.330> spawning<00:06:12.630> where<00:06:13.230> our<00:06:13.320> you

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
errors in our MPC spawning where our you

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.470 
errors in our MPC spawning where our you
chills<00:06:13.770> folder<00:06:14.190> and<00:06:14.370> since<00:06:14.640> this<00:06:14.880> compiler

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
chills folder and since this compiler

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.320 
chills folder and since this compiler
only<00:06:16.020> compiles<00:06:16.710> utils<00:06:17.070> folder<00:06:17.490> since<00:06:18.180> there

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
only compiles utils folder since there

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.820 
only compiles utils folder since there
was<00:06:18.419> an<00:06:18.510> error<00:06:18.780> at<00:06:19.020> like<00:06:19.230> don't<00:06:19.440> compile<00:06:19.800> that

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
was an error at like don't compile that

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.540 
was an error at like don't compile that
folder<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:21.480> it<00:06:22.050> did<00:06:22.110> not<00:06:22.530> fix<00:06:22.950> the<00:06:23.160> changes

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
folder and so it did not fix the changes

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.730 
folder and so it did not fix the changes
but<00:06:23.760> that's<00:06:23.970> how<00:06:24.120> we've<00:06:24.240> done<00:06:24.330> it<00:06:24.390> and<00:06:24.740> some

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
but that's how we've done it and some

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.159 
but that's how we've done it and some
for<00:06:26.430> some<00:06:26.610> reason<00:06:27.030> I'm<00:06:27.240> not<00:06:27.270> she<00:06:27.570> too<00:06:27.720> sure<00:06:27.930> why

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
for some reason I'm not she too sure why

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.440 
for some reason I'm not she too sure why
but<00:06:28.590> for<00:06:28.650> some<00:06:28.800> reason<00:06:29.250> if<00:06:29.460> you<00:06:29.790> remove<00:06:30.330> an
