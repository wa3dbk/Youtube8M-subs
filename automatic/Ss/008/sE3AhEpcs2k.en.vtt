00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
basically he didn't really say if it was

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.130 
basically he didn't really say if it was
good<00:01:23.750> or<00:01:23.960> bad

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
basically all he said was that it was a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.730 
basically all he said was that it was a
baseline<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.880> which<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.810> all<00:01:30.050> well<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.440> good

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
baseline so which is all well and good

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.060 
baseline so which is all well and good
and<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:31.340> know<00:01:31.670> what<00:01:31.910> they<00:01:32.030> need<00:01:32.179> that<00:01:32.450> but<00:01:32.780> just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.770

so I came out of it thinking you know
like<00:01:44.080> now<00:01:44.680> what<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.820> now<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.390> wait

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
like now what so now I have to wait

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.020 
like now what so now I have to wait
another<00:01:46.750> three<00:01:46.900> months<00:01:47.440> until<00:01:47.560> my<00:01:47.800> next<00:01:48.250> scan

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
another three months until my next scan

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.510 
another three months until my next scan
to<00:01:49.510> figure<00:01:49.840> out<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.770> compare<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.370> those

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
to figure out to compare it to those

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.670 
to figure out to compare it to those
results<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.600> lot<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.900> waiting

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
results so it's just a lot of waiting

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.730 
results so it's just a lot of waiting
around<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.340> not<00:01:55.090> knowing<00:01:55.420> if<00:01:56.020> you're<00:01:56.260> okay<00:01:56.590> or

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the oncologist said about their results

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.760 
the oncologist said about their results
and

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.100 

since<00:04:13.660> January<00:04:15.310> she<00:04:16.310> just<00:04:16.519> said<00:04:16.730> it's<00:04:17.360> I'm<00:04:17.930> in

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
since January she just said it's I'm in

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.039 
since January she just said it's I'm in
a<00:04:18.140> stable<00:04:18.560> state<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.400> was<00:04:19.519> okay<00:04:19.870> not<00:04:20.870> to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
a stable state so it was okay not to

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.050 
a stable state so it was okay not to
worry<00:04:21.260> but<00:04:21.920> they<00:04:22.100> obviously<00:04:22.220> want<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.790> keep<00:04:22.850> an

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
worry but they obviously want to keep an

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.450 
worry but they obviously want to keep an
eye<00:04:23.150> on<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.510> what<00:04:23.930> she<00:04:24.140> said<00:04:24.410> was<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.650> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
eye on it what she said was that the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.590 
eye on it what she said was that the
lymph<00:04:25.670> node<00:04:25.910> grew<00:04:27.640> grew<00:04:28.640> three<00:04:29.000> millimeters

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
lymph node grew grew three millimeters

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.990 
lymph node grew grew three millimeters
from<00:04:29.960> three<00:04:30.680> months<00:04:30.920> ago<00:04:31.010> or<00:04:31.340> two<00:04:31.610> months<00:04:31.820> ago

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
from three months ago or two months ago

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.440 
from three months ago or two months ago
yes

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
yes

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.860 
yes
so<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.380> went<00:04:33.560> from<00:04:34.120> seven<00:04:35.120> millimeters<00:04:35.720> by

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
so it went from seven millimeters by

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.350 
so it went from seven millimeters by
nine<00:04:36.110> millimeters<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:37.070> seven<00:04:37.490> millimeters<00:04:38.120> by

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
nine millimeters to seven millimeters by

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.530 
nine millimeters to seven millimeters by
12<00:04:38.690> millimeters<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:40.010> it's<00:04:40.640> not<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:41.030> much<00:04:41.360> of

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
12 millimeters so it's not that much of

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.930 
12 millimeters so it's not that much of
a<00:04:41.630> difference<00:04:41.750> but<00:04:42.650> obviously<00:04:43.460> they're<00:04:43.700> a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
a difference but obviously they're a

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.730 
a difference but obviously they're a
little<00:04:44.270> bit<00:04:44.510> concerned<00:04:44.720> they<00:04:45.290> just<00:04:45.470> want<00:04:45.650> to

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
little bit concerned they just want to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.280 
little bit concerned they just want to
make<00:04:46.340> sure<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:49.930> basically<00:04:50.930> because<00:04:51.260> of

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
make sure that basically because of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.340 
make sure that basically because of
those<00:04:51.560> results<00:04:52.130> they're<00:04:52.370> going<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:53.000> decide<00:04:53.690> in

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
those results they're going to decide in

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.190 
those results they're going to decide in
June<00:04:54.740> when<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:54.980> see<00:04:55.250> my<00:04:56.120> actual<00:04:56.330> oncologist

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
June when I see my actual oncologist

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.220 
June when I see my actual oncologist
he's<00:04:58.190> going<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.490> decide<00:04:58.850> whether<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.690> get

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
he's going to decide whether I get

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.640 
he's going to decide whether I get
another<00:05:00.470> cat<00:05:00.770> skin<00:05:01.160> or<00:05:02.020> wait<00:05:03.020> another<00:05:03.230> three

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
another cat skin or wait another three

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.620 
another cat skin or wait another three
months<00:05:03.800> after<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.400> because<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.150> just<00:05:05.180> got<00:05:05.570> a

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
months after that because I just got a

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.030 
months after that because I just got a
cat<00:05:05.900> scan<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:08.120> month<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:09.530> they<00:05:09.740> don't<00:05:09.919> want

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
cat scan this month so they don't want

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.550 
cat scan this month so they don't want
to<00:05:10.750> they<00:05:11.750> don't<00:05:11.930> want<00:05:12.080> to<00:05:12.140> give<00:05:12.290> me<00:05:12.410> more

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
to they don't want to give me more

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.090 
to they don't want to give me more
radiation<00:05:12.890> that

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
radiation that

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.250 
radiation that
Cerie<00:05:14.400> because<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:15.090> are<00:05:15.600> you<00:05:15.840> went<00:05:16.020> through<00:05:16.170> all

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
every time they do a cat scan and x-rays

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.560 
every time they do a cat scan and x-rays
don't<00:05:25.980> have<00:05:26.160> as<00:05:26.310> much<00:05:26.520> radiation<00:05:26.910> as<00:05:27.240> cats

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
don't have as much radiation as cats

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.780 
don't have as much radiation as cats
kids<00:05:27.840> do<00:05:28.080> so<00:05:28.380> we're<00:05:28.920> trying<00:05:29.160> to<00:05:29.220> minimize<00:05:29.370> the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
kids do so we're trying to minimize the

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.300 
kids do so we're trying to minimize the
amount<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.180> radiation<00:05:30.600> that<00:05:30.990> they<00:05:31.230> emit<00:05:31.980> onto
