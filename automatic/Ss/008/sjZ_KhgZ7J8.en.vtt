00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.169
 does not throw now it concerns and therefore 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.169
 one more this one only 5 times 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 however, this is not enough 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.570
 budget revenues should not determine 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.659
 weaker 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.659
 another two were broken glass 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.320
 not 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 after all 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.700
 l goal 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.130
 Litvinenko 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.810
 by team 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.810
 in year 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.110
 by the way to throw 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.190
 does not score a goal before 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.050
 duel 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.110
 flight but will not be in this business 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 yes do it 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.030
 for president 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.560
 probably need 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.899
 it is not clear where he lay down within which they are not 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.250
 reach 3 2 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 but what to do in such a situation 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 they see migrants 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.860
 who goes to Odessa for residents Pikalevo 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.690
 but here in fact of course just 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 shifts the single 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.050
 to answer 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.050
 in this match 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 before alexander 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.739
 the record will look like this 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.399
 if current trends 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.729
 I can say but everything should be a situation and 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.729
 its technical regulations 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.949
 and they all have long been accustomed 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.949
 anyway 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.969
 It is assumed that the purchase and sale 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.469
 food Russian troops nato
