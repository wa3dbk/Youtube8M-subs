00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 and being in the competition has been a 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.549
 I dream that they have sunk only because I did not have 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.529
 the support to my parents is a municipality 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.570
 when we told them peace I wanted 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.550
 participate in the program in fact do not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.230
 he really liked the idea because they had 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.490
 very afraid of which they take allows to take 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 the decision to dedicate myself fully to the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.029
 music and also mine the instability 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.560
 economic that could bring what thing 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.420
 I was going to be removed from my career 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.660
 right that I was on track and everything 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660
 that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
 and getting here is not just a dream 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.539
 that I have but it is also the way 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.700
 show my dad that they can be 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.199
 proud of me as an artist something in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 against what I 've fought all my life 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.800
 are my insecurities and fears in fact 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.949
 has always depended a lot on the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.269
 approval from my family of my parents 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.949
 specifically but now that finally 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.629
 I already made the decision to dedicate myself to 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.220
 music I will not live more like the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.690
 ghost of what would have happened if 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.949
 I would have tried now what am I 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.420

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.380
 commercial break I listened to your video that the 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.360
 Dad did not support you much with the subject 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.810
 of singing good yes but I am in return 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.270
 happily do not tell me seriously because I 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.800
 I say one more thing besides having 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.040
 changed the perception of dads 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.140
 they have something to tell you 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.140
 that the dads pass clear of course 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.180
 in this semifinal night 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.450
 believe me it is extremely important that 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.640

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.120

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.880

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.520

 baby and to tell you that now you have 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.570

 your happiness comes first for 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.190
 we 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.980
 I can not cry in the first block myself 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.340
 for dad to see please let me 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.249
 I want to read this you can read it you are going 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.999
 to sound prettier in his voice 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:29.999
 necessary 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:38.240
 my son always had his dreams 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:42.650
 and I 'm always very excited 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.340
 always had dreams and had a lot of 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.569
 the only value to meet them and 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.370
 now he is about to make it come true 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.370
 I was a great stone on the road 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.660
 but 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.129
 like many parents 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.580
 we do not know how to see the children's hearts 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:09.689
 we want to believe that there are times the best 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:15.110
 we create is a security 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:15.110
 but I see it so happy is comparable 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.240
 we do not understand we do not have jowls and cream 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.529
 that does not serve a stone on the way to 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.629
 parents are always going to look for the best 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:24.400
 for the children and on the road we give ourselves 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.169
 mind that we can also take other 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.659
 important decisions that are together 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.370
 believe in the one with him in this 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:33.039
 moment, good luck, we are going to 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.569
 the commercial break is missing a participant 

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:37.620
 more for his team we come back with this 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:37.620
 semifinal night
