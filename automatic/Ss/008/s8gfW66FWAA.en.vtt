00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 hi this is Chernakov motto and today I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.750
 here just arrived drove around the island 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.359
 for speedy enough stuff 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.779
 bugs very cool quickly mastered 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.920
 never went before but great and 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.439
 now wanted to talk to you about 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.180
 one important thing I note that in your 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.130
 life there are some needs which 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 you implement 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 if you realize them cool you can 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 implement them eco-friendly for you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.350
 way if you don't realize getting 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.660
 something is not very cool I will explain that this 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 maybe for example and someone constantly in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.800
 life changes partners can be on business 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 possible companions of life 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.250
 why because for example where is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.809
 value such as variety and everything and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 if the need is not realized yes she 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.100
 implemented the shortest either 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.780
 the closest ways but by truth 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.020
 partners there is nothing difficult you can even 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.479
 at work on their own business or there on 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 study anywhere and somebody constantly i'm not 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.869
 I know you need to 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.670
 feel like a man therefore 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.340
 make scandals at home and in them 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.689
 constantly goes out to the winner though for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.460
 to feel like men 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.900
 more environmentally friendly to go in for boxing 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.450
 for example, well, or something you understand and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.110
 so I beg you and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.790
 why am I talking about it at all 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.950
 because for example there is a need 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.939
 enough of such thrill I know 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.540
 that if you don't satisfy her, then I'll start 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.200
 it all the same he satisfy somehow and 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.000
 there may not be a way for me 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.829
 I like it so sometimes I feel better 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.790
 just drive like this and now 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.680
 answer the question for yourself 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.140
 what need are you in life 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.560
 Satisfied with the ways that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.210
 you do not fit actually creating 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 currently we are a problem today 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.229
 a group here on an island about it 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 talked creating yourself a problem in life 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.810
 for example and then heroically with them 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 struggling often this need for extreme 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.940
 sometimes we are late or repent what 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.070
 work because she apologized 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.650
 rude word but make mistakes on 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.390
 because I want to work 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 it turned out we have one of the participants 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.650
 I want to be treated 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.550
 roughly well good 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.080
 can you tell your husband that you 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.750
 I want to need a group of treatment 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.240
 tenderness and rudeness why not but it 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.060
 will be better than if you are bad 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.610
 working with you will be treated badly 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.440
 at work and you will implement your 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.140
 need but it's like a complicated way 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.230
 true again when the need is not 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.620
 recognized she is satisfied the most 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.360
 simple and close way to say 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.130
 sometimes itâ€™s not just a sorcerer 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.530
 shit think you something suddenly 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.260
 thought so you pervert washed-or 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.440
 he will like it but you never know 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.110
 all this will not happen true but we 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.049
 it is afraid to do i ask you to be about 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.760
 gram of this video write one sphere 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.610
 life in which you are not very happy 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.620
 so what happens answer the question 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.900
 what need and there you satisfy and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.340
 third find a way how or 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 satisfy differently and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.600
 satisfaction and see what happens 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.720
 background like this is about needs this 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.970
 how we create problems for ourselves 2 2 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.530
