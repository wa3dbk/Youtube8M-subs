00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
view starting with the outsole we have a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
view starting with the outsole we have a
all<00:00:43.440> white<00:00:43.649> outsole<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.760> well<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.149> hints<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
all white outsole as well as hints of

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.310 
all white outsole as well as hints of
black<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:46.079> well<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.590> true<00:00:46.920> red

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.560 

you<00:00:49.829> also<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.160> hints<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> gray<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.449> guys

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you also have hints of gray as you guys

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.590 
you also have hints of gray as you guys
can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.780> black<00:00:52.739> jungler<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> top<00:00:53.600> pretty

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
can see black jungler in the top pretty

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.470 
can see black jungler in the top pretty
similar<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.530> guess<00:00:56.309> holes<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> original

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
similar I guess holes to the original

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.069 
similar I guess holes to the original
retro<00:00:57.840> sevens<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> step<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.239> guess<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
retro sevens it is a step up I guess so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
retro sevens it is a step up I guess so
it's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.379> technically<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> better<00:01:02.430> basketball

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it's a technically a better basketball

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's a technically a better basketball
shoe<00:01:03.680> than<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> sevens<00:01:05.510> instead<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.600> moving

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
shoe than the sevens instead of moving

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.030 
shoe than the sevens instead of moving
on<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> uppers<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> same

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
on to the uppers we have the same

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.969 
on to the uppers we have the same
midsole<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> grey<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.299> touch<00:01:09.689> yourself

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
midsole with the grey and touch yourself

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.359 
midsole with the grey and touch yourself
red<00:01:11.060> it's<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> glassy<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.159> stay<00:01:14.159> more

red it's kind of glassy or stay more
classier<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> outsole<00:01:15.479> white<00:01:15.900> part<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
then we have this plastic tab with the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.840 
then we have this plastic tab with the
same<00:01:20.670> pattern<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.299> found<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> bottom

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850

and then we have a gray material that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.500 
and then we have a gray material that
feels<00:01:29.420> like<00:01:29.660> suede<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.820> does<00:01:32.060> feel<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.330> little
