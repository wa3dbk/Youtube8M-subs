kept on lumber for far too long because

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.450 
kept on lumber for far too long because
thursday<00:00:07.140> now<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.529> almost<00:00:07.740> 4,000<00:00:08.250> lumber

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.830 
thursday now is almost 4,000 lumber
that's<00:00:08.580> far<00:00:08.760> more<00:00:08.790> than<00:00:09.059> these<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.510> anime

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
that's far more than these and anime

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.660 
that's far more than these and anime
dead<00:00:10.110> being<00:00:10.349> used<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.710> that's<00:00:11.160> an<00:00:11.340> ultimate

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
dead being used and that's an ultimate

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.310 
dead being used and that's an ultimate
he<00:00:11.790> almost<00:00:12.059> never<00:00:12.210> see<00:00:12.509> Ben's<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.049> this

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
he almost never see Ben's in this

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.450 
he almost never see Ben's in this
situation<00:00:13.559> might<00:00:13.889> actually<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.219> quite<00:00:14.309> useful

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
situation might actually be quite useful

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.530 
situation might actually be quite useful
I<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:14.730> he<00:00:14.910> must<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.150> bought<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> mana

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I think he must have bought a mana

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.269 
I think he must have bought a mana
potion<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.109> he<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.289> use<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.619> obviously

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
potion so that he could use it obviously

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.710 
potion so that he could use it obviously

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
this and I'll just cause a lot of damage

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.979 
this and I'll just cause a lot of damage
to<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.430> opponent<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.390> lot<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> them

to your opponent and a lot of them

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.170 
to your opponent and a lot of them
really<00:00:34.559> low<00:00:34.710> breakers<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:36.000> goes

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
really low breakers here and one goes

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.540 
really low breakers here and one goes
down<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.570> goes<00:00:36.780> down<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.040> likely<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> go

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
down to goes down to more likely to go

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
down to goes down to more likely to go
down<00:00:38.700> any<00:00:38.820> second<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.239> although<00:00:39.510> actually<00:00:39.899> no

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
down any second now although actually no

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
down any second now although actually no
one<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.469> gets<00:00:40.649> taken<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one more gets taken down there and so a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
one more gets taken down there and so a
lot<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> experience<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.200> these<00:00:43.290> undead

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
lot of experience going for these undead

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
lot of experience going for these undead
heroes<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.910> something<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.149> 6<00:00:45.530> 55

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
heroes I think it's something like 6 55

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.799 
heroes I think it's something like 6 55
65<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.309> almost<00:00:47.789> five<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.239> Panthers<00:00:48.660> well

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
65 for almost five on that Panthers well

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.959 
65 for almost five on that Panthers well
and<00:00:48.989> disabuse<00:00:49.950> breakers<00:00:50.280> continuing<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> go

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and disabuse breakers continuing to go

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490 
and disabuse breakers continuing to go
down<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> some<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.750> nice<00:00:51.960> focus<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
down to some really nice focus for a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.760 
down to some really nice focus for a
combined<00:00:52.829> who<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.430> quo<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.910> off<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
combined who I'm quo going off on that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.869 
combined who I'm quo going off on that
blood<00:00:55.770> mage<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.160> blood<00:00:56.309> nation<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.820> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
blood mage in that blood nation lot of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
blood mage in that blood nation lot of
trouble<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.809> looks<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.230> might<00:00:58.410> go

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
trouble now it looks like you might go

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.740 
trouble now it looks like you might go
down<00:00:59.219> invisibility<00:00:59.850> being<00:01:00.210> used<00:01:00.359> again<00:01:00.629> on

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
down invisibility being used again on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.410 
down invisibility being used again on
him<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.350> um<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.280> absorbed<00:01:03.239> by<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
him but um I think that absorbed by the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
him but um I think that absorbed by the
destroy<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.320> tricky<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.650> do

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
destroy that's really tricky to do

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
destroy that's really tricky to do
because<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.280> where<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
because you don't know where that is and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.969 
because you don't know where that is and
another<00:01:06.930> absorption<00:01:07.439> being<00:01:07.590> used<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
another absorption being used there in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.880 
another absorption being used there in
that<00:01:08.510> very<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.630> nice<00:01:09.960> feather<00:01:10.140> by<00:01:10.380> hasu<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that very very nice feather by hasu and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
that very very nice feather by hasu and
it<00:01:11.280> looks<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.549> nasty<00:01:12.030> last<00:01:12.270> night<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.630> almost

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it looks like nasty last night of almost

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
it looks like nasty last night of almost
single-handedly<00:01:13.500> turn<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.830> around<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.280> mean

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
single-handedly turn this around I mean

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.499 
single-handedly turn this around I mean
certainly<00:01:14.670> rains<00:01:15.000> played<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> role<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
certainly rains played a role and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
certainly rains played a role and
there's<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> GG<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.170> throwing<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> really
