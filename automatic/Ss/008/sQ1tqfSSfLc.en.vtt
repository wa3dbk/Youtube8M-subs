00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
top so although we're pulling at an

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
top so although we're pulling at an
angle<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> outer<00:01:35.280> edge<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.450> taking

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
angle on the outer edge and also taking

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
angle on the outer edge and also taking
it<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> inner<00:01:37.290> corner<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> eye<00:01:37.799> we're

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it on the inner corner of the eye we're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640 
it on the inner corner of the eye we're
not<00:01:38.640> taking<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> any<00:01:39.390> higher<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> center

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
not taking it any higher on the center

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
not taking it any higher on the center
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> eyelid<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> makes<00:01:41.790> sense

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
of the eyelid if that makes sense

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
of the eyelid if that makes sense
so<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.409> I'm<00:01:43.560> blending<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.040> out
