and<00:01:26.430> he<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> he<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.390> without<00:01:27.540> much

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and he and he can do that without much

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
and he and he can do that without much
reserve<00:01:28.229> simply<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.369> right

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
reserve simply because that's right

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.270 
reserve simply because that's right
outside<00:01:29.700> movies<00:01:30.390> main<00:01:30.630> base<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.590> he<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.130> see

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
outside movies main base and he can see

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
outside movies main base and he can see
most<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> drops<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.210> oh<00:01:33.299> man<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.840> I

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
most the drops going and oh man just I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.190 
most the drops going and oh man just I
cannot<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.280> cannot<00:01:35.520> iterate<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.509> how<00:01:36.840> many

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
cannot I cannot iterate how how many

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.280 
cannot I cannot iterate how how many
bases<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:39.210> mine<00:01:39.420> has<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.990> point<00:01:40.200> he

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
bases that mine has at this point he

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
bases that mine has at this point he
controls<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.890> much<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> map<00:01:41.460> yeah<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
controls so much of the map yeah it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
controls so much of the map yeah it
looks<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.600> he's<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.780> gonna<00:01:42.930> plant<00:01:43.680> turrets

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
looks like he's just gonna plant turrets

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
looks like he's just gonna plant turrets
around<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> base<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.909> only<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.299> two

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
around the base really only two two

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.569 
around the base really only two two
locations<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.680> producing<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.430> much

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
locations really producing all that much

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.090 
locations really producing all that much
for<00:01:47.880> movie<00:01:48.299> anymore<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.409> pretty<00:01:49.740> soon<00:01:49.920> that's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
for movie anymore and pretty soon that's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.740 
for movie anymore and pretty soon that's
going<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
going to

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.180 
going to
just<00:01:50.870> gonna<00:01:50.960> see<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> huge<00:01:51.530> amount<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.830> forces

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
just gonna see a huge amount of forces

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.070 
just gonna see a huge amount of forces
out<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.490> Maya<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.510> teeny<00:01:53.750> amount<00:01:53.870> of

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
out for Maya and just a teeny amount of

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.530 
out for Maya and just a teeny amount of
forces<00:01:54.440> out<00:01:54.590> for<00:01:55.310> movie<00:01:55.730> and<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.180> just

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
forces out for movie and you just

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.090 
forces out for movie and you just
basically<00:01:56.720> use<00:01:57.050> this<00:01:57.230> dropship<00:01:57.740> force<00:01:57.980> that

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
basically use this dropship force that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.450 
basically use this dropship force that
he<00:01:58.190> has<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:59.060> drop<00:01:59.360> all<00:01:59.630> over<00:02:00.370> doesn't<00:02:01.370> matter

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
he has to drop all over doesn't matter

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.740 
he has to drop all over doesn't matter
how<00:02:01.670> many<00:02:01.700> turrets<00:02:02.030> he<00:02:02.180> has<00:02:02.270> up<00:02:02.479> he's<00:02:02.630> just

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
how many turrets he has up he's just

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.120 
how many turrets he has up he's just
gonna<00:02:02.840> be<00:02:02.990> able<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.200> use<00:02:03.290> an<00:02:03.440> oval<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.770> enforce

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
gonna be able to use an oval and enforce

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.070 
gonna be able to use an oval and enforce
of<00:02:04.250> Tanks<00:02:04.610> relies<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.120> these<00:02:05.479> drop<00:02:05.690> ships<00:02:05.930> to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
of Tanks relies on these drop ships to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.650 
of Tanks relies on these drop ships to
kind<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.290> go<00:02:06.410> an<00:02:06.590> impression<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:08.270> it'll<00:02:08.570> be

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
kind of go an impression and it'll be

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.410 
kind of go an impression and it'll be
interesting<00:02:08.840> if<00:02:09.140> he<00:02:09.170> looks<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.970> I'm

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
interesting if he looks like that I'm

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.490 
interesting if he looks like that I'm
not<00:02:11.510> sure<00:02:11.570> what<00:02:11.900> blew<00:02:12.080> up<00:02:12.140> there<00:02:12.320> might<00:02:12.470> have

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
not sure what blew up there might have

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.410 
not sure what blew up there might have
been<00:02:12.590> engine<00:02:12.920> right<00:02:13.070> there<00:02:13.280> right<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.610> but

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
been engine right there right there but

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.610 
been engine right there right there but
right<00:02:14.630> now<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.840> looks<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.110> what<00:02:15.410> mine's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
right now it looks like what mine's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.690 
right now it looks like what mine's
going<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.890> do<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.130> just<00:02:16.160> gonna<00:02:16.400> use<00:02:16.580> these

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
going to do is just gonna use these

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.310 
going to do is just gonna use these
dropships<00:02:17.150> trail<00:02:17.570> across<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.959> middle<00:02:18.200> make

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
dropships trail across the middle make

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.740 
dropships trail across the middle make
sure<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.680> can't<00:02:19.310> get<00:02:19.490> out<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.480> then

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
sure that we can't get out and then

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.990 
sure that we can't get out and then
basically<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.040> any<00:02:22.370> map<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.700> large

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
basically as you can see any map a large

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.310 
basically as you can see any map a large
amount<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.360> forces<00:02:23.720> in<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.870> background

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
amount of forces in the background

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.290 
amount of forces in the background
starting<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.160> push<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.580> he's<00:02:25.910> just<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
starting to push in he's just going to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.270 
starting to push in he's just going to
basically<00:02:26.540> start<00:02:26.930> streaming<00:02:27.320> forces<00:02:27.709> along

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
basically start streaming forces along

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.740 
basically start streaming forces along
as<00:02:28.459> he<00:02:28.580> feels<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.940> he<00:02:29.090> has<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.270> large<00:02:29.540> enough

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
as he feels like he has a large enough

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.140 
as he feels like he has a large enough
force<00:02:30.280> getting<00:02:31.280> another<00:02:31.520> expansion<00:02:31.850> down

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
force getting another expansion down

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.240 
force getting another expansion down
once<00:02:32.330> he<00:02:32.420> has<00:02:32.570> large<00:02:32.840> net<00:02:32.989> force<00:02:33.260> he's<00:02:34.070> just

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
once he has large net force he's just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.690 
once he has large net force he's just
gonna<00:02:34.340> press<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.120> finish<00:02:35.510> movie<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.700> wow

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
gonna press in and finish movie and wow

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.699 
gonna press in and finish movie and wow
yeah<00:02:38.120> as<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:38.510> see<00:02:38.660> producing<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.530> so

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
yeah as you can see producing out of so

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.130 
yeah as you can see producing out of so
many<00:02:39.860> bases<00:02:40.250> right<00:02:40.430> now<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:41.450> getting<00:02:41.720> another

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
many bases right now and getting another

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.770 
many bases right now and getting another
base<00:02:42.440> down<00:02:42.680> he<00:02:42.950> controls<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.459> entire<00:02:43.670> map<00:02:44.150> he

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
base down he controls the entire map he

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.660 
base down he controls the entire map he
has<00:02:44.989> all<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.470> resources<00:02:45.590> right<00:02:46.130> now<00:02:46.340> and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
has all the resources right now and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.220 
has all the resources right now and
we'll<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.209> if<00:02:47.239> he<00:02:47.390> decides<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.810> end<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.110> right

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
we'll see if he decides to end it right

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.720 
we'll see if he decides to end it right
here<00:02:48.290> because<00:02:48.709> he<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:48.980> again<00:02:49.459> he<00:02:49.580> already

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
here because he just again he already

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.910 
here because he just again he already
has<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:49.970> large<00:02:50.239> force<00:02:50.540> movie<00:02:50.989> completely<00:02:51.739> in

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
has a large force movie completely in

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.350 
has a large force movie completely in
defensive<00:02:52.310> mode<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.640> don't<00:02:52.820> see<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> movie

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
defensive mode and I don't see a movie

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.440 
defensive mode and I don't see a movie
winning<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> long<00:02:54.110> run<00:02:55.120> he's<00:02:56.120> gonna<00:02:56.269> have<00:02:56.420> to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
winning the long run he's gonna have to

attack that my presented him but really
mind<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:01.020> leisurely<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.740> be<00:04:01.830> able<00:04:01.920> to

kind<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.350> present<00:04:04.770> out<00:04:04.830> when<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.040> really<00:04:05.280> needed

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
kind of present out when I really needed

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.040 
kind of present out when I really needed
to<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.910> think<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.480> was<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> clever<00:04:06.810> strategy

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
to I think that was a clever strategy

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.550 
to I think that was a clever strategy
putting<00:04:07.590> down<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.770> natural<00:04:08.220> expansion<00:04:08.489> but

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
putting down a natural expansion but

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.870 
putting down a natural expansion but
just<00:04:10.560> not<00:04:10.739> pressing<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.340> when<00:04:11.489> he<00:04:11.580> needed<00:04:11.760> to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
just not pressing in when he needed to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.180 
just not pressing in when he needed to
and<00:04:12.360> not<00:04:13.050> taking<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> rest<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.860> map<00:04:14.040> when

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
and not taking the rest of the map when

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.900 
and not taking the rest of the map when
he<00:04:14.280> needed<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:16.130> very<00:04:17.130> creative<00:04:17.340> play<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:17.760> not

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
he needed to very creative play but not

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.849 
he needed to very creative play but not
paying<00:04:18.150> off<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.140> that's<00:04:19.650> really

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
paying off it and that's really

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.080 
paying off it and that's really
disappointing<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.370> really<00:04:20.580> wanted<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.940> see

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
disappointing I really wanted to see

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.240 
disappointing I really wanted to see
movie<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.780> witness<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.440> no<00:04:22.590> I'm<00:04:22.770> talking<00:04:23.160> as

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
movie a witness and no I'm talking as

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.440 
movie a witness and no I'm talking as
though<00:04:23.280> he's<00:04:23.520> already<00:04:23.760> defeated<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.360> that

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
though he's already defeated and that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.080 
though he's already defeated and that
it's<00:04:24.570> kind<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.750> inevitable<00:04:25.520> but<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.700> really<00:04:27.060> I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
it's kind of inevitable but I really I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.600 
it's kind of inevitable but I really I
honestly<00:04:27.780> feel<00:04:27.960> these<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.650> lot<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.220> tanks<00:04:29.490> were

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
honestly feel these a lot of tanks were

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.970 
honestly feel these a lot of tanks were
enforcing<00:04:29.940> anything<00:04:30.450> yeah<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.260> think<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.650> lot<00:04:31.950> of

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
enforcing anything yeah I think a lot of

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.890 
enforcing anything yeah I think a lot of
those<00:04:32.160> dropships<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.640> could<00:04:32.760> just<00:04:32.940> press<00:04:33.720> down

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
those dropships I could just press down

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.480 
those dropships I could just press down
on<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.290> man<00:04:34.500> basically<00:04:35.010> what<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.130> what

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
on that man basically what that what

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.580 
on that man basically what that what
that's<00:04:35.669> doing<00:04:35.880> for<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:37.169> mind<00:04:37.350> at<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.500> moment

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
that's doing for for mind at that moment

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.590 
that's doing for for mind at that moment
is<00:04:37.890> that's<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.280> force<00:04:38.520> those<00:04:38.700> those

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
is that's going to force those those

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.020 
is that's going to force those those
forces<00:04:39.900> out<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.320> dropship<00:04:40.910> he's<00:04:41.910> going

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
forces out of that dropship he's going

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.490 
forces out of that dropship he's going
to<00:04:42.120> be<00:04:42.180> able<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.419> basically<00:04:42.630> just<00:04:43.020> get<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> huge

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
to be able to basically just get a huge

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.560 
to be able to basically just get a huge
force<00:04:43.710> probably<00:04:44.280> plug<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.790> straight<00:04:45.540> up

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
force probably plug just straight up

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.620 
force probably plug just straight up
model<00:04:46.190> probably<00:04:47.190> what<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.120> would<00:04:48.180> do<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:48.540> I

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
model probably what I would do is I

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.240 
model probably what I would do is I
would<00:04:48.660> take<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:48.930> expand<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.590> expansion

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
would take that expand that expansion

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.310 
would take that expand that expansion
was<00:04:50.490> camped<00:04:50.790> outside<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:51.210> right<00:04:51.390> right<00:04:51.870> now<00:04:52.020> as

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
was camped outside of right right now as

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.780 
was camped outside of right right now as
soon<00:04:52.470> as<00:04:52.590> he<00:04:52.680> does<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.860> camp<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.460> bunch<00:04:53.730> of

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
these tanks out the outside hoping kind

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.280 
these tanks out the outside hoping kind
of<00:04:55.830> do<00:04:56.090> as<00:04:57.090> soon<00:04:57.270> as<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.450> siege<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.900> cross<00:04:58.110> that

spot that out but really what the line

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.710 
spot that out but really what the line
is<00:05:36.770> going<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.100> produce<00:05:37.220> out<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.670> his<00:05:37.880> his<00:05:38.480> base

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
is going to produce out of his his base

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.210 
is going to produce out of his his base
in<00:05:38.750> meantime<00:05:39.110> it's<00:05:39.710> gonna<00:05:39.830> be<00:05:39.980> able<00:05:40.070> to

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
in meantime it's gonna be able to

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.530 
in meantime it's gonna be able to
counter<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:40.700> it<00:05:40.940> looks<00:05:41.150> like<00:05:41.240> he's<00:05:41.360> just

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
counter this it looks like he's just

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.690 
counter this it looks like he's just
playing<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:42.080> bunch<00:05:42.200> of<00:05:42.320> SUVs<00:05:42.770> down<00:05:43.400> underneath

playing a bunch of SUVs down underneath
and<00:05:43.970> he's<00:05:44.090> gonna<00:05:44.180> be<00:05:44.330> able<00:05:44.390> to<00:05:44.540> take<00:05:44.690> this<00:05:44.870> out

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
and he's gonna be able to take this out

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.450 
and he's gonna be able to take this out
almost<00:05:45.230> with<00:05:45.410> SCPs<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.040> he's<00:05:46.130> producing

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
almost with SCPs that he's producing

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.730 
almost with SCPs that he's producing
alone<00:05:47.140> yeah<00:05:48.140> as<00:05:48.230> you<00:05:48.320> can<00:05:48.440> see<00:05:48.560> in<00:05:48.650> the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
meantime bringing a lot of units take

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.150 
meantime bringing a lot of units take
care<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:50.870> that<00:05:50.990> attack<00:05:51.260> force<00:05:51.500> we're<00:05:51.950> actually

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
care of that attack force we're actually

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.990 
care of that attack force we're actually
he's<00:05:53.060> wow<00:05:53.630> you<00:05:54.560> can<00:05:54.710> see<00:05:54.950> able<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.610> fill<00:05:55.760> up<00:05:55.850> all

he's wow you can see able to fill up all

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.160 
he's wow you can see able to fill up all
those<00:05:56.120> dropships<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:56.630> we<00:05:56.720> might<00:05:56.870> be<00:05:56.990> able<00:05:57.050> to

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
those dropships so we might be able to

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.110 
those dropships so we might be able to
save<00:05:57.410> that<00:05:57.650> in<00:05:58.310> the<00:05:58.400> meantime<00:05:58.520> like<00:05:58.850> that

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.430 
save that in the meantime like that
looks<00:05:59.360> like<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.630> natural<00:05:59.780> expansion<00:06:00.110> did

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
looks like the natural expansion did

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.780 
looks like the natural expansion did
have<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.620> lot<00:06:00.770> of<00:06:00.830> resided<00:06:01.340> still<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.670> that's

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
have a lot of resided still and that's

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.590 
have a lot of resided still and that's
been<00:06:01.970> taken<00:06:02.240> out<00:06:02.380> he's<00:06:03.380> just<00:06:03.860> probably<00:06:04.070> gonna

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
been taken out he's just probably gonna

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.700 
been taken out he's just probably gonna
looks<00:06:05.600> like<00:06:05.690> he's<00:06:05.870> gonna<00:06:05.990> try<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.260> save<00:06:06.470> this<00:06:06.590> I

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
looks like he's gonna try to save this I

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.990 
looks like he's gonna try to save this I
would<00:06:06.830> have<00:06:06.920> actually<00:06:07.010> take<00:06:07.310> him<00:06:07.430> out<00:06:07.550> right

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
would have actually take him out right

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.820 
would have actually take him out right
into<00:06:08.120> movies<00:06:08.480> main<00:06:08.780> instead<00:06:09.590> of<00:06:09.680> bothering

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
into movies main instead of bothering

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.380 
into movies main instead of bothering
otherwise<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.520> think<00:06:10.730> once<00:06:10.910> this<00:06:11.060> attack

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
otherwise and I think once this attack

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.030 
otherwise and I think once this attack
is<00:06:11.420> basically<00:06:12.230> stopped<00:06:12.530> that's<00:06:12.770> going<00:06:12.890> to<00:06:12.950> be
