00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.870 
the matches in the future are you gonna
change<00:02:07.259> anything<00:02:07.590> about<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:08.340> strategy<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
change anything about your strategy and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.370 
change anything about your strategy and
how<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> practice<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.990> just<00:02:10.170> gonna

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
how you practice or are you just gonna

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.370 
how you practice or are you just gonna
try<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.920> put<00:02:11.130> your<00:02:11.250> head<00:02:11.370> back<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.700> game<00:02:12.380> I

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
try to put your head back in the game I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.290 
try to put your head back in the game I
guess<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.100> depends<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.520> who<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:14.760> gonna<00:02:15.000> fight

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
guess it depends on who I'm gonna fight

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360 
guess it depends on who I'm gonna fight
next<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.990> guess<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.650> probably<00:02:16.860> doesn't<00:02:17.220> want<00:02:17.340> to
