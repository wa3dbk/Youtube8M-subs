00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Xbox skip alright that's how you do it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
Xbox skip alright that's how you do it
you'd<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.530> say<00:01:04.680> xbox<00:01:05.159> skip<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.150> we'll<00:01:06.330> do

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you'd have to say xbox skip so we'll do

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.370 
you'd have to say xbox skip so we'll do
that<00:01:07.100> one<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.850> think<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.260> not

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that one more time I think if I'm not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
that one more time I think if I'm not
mistaken<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:12.830> we've<00:01:13.830> got<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> stamina<00:01:14.460> bar

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
mistaken so we've got the stamina bar

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
mistaken so we've got the stamina bar
which<00:01:15.299> basically<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> lose<00:01:16.890> all

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
which basically you know if you lose all

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
which basically you know if you lose all
your<00:01:17.189> stamina<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.689> able

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
your stamina you're not going to be able

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.590 
your stamina you're not going to be able
to<00:01:18.960> swim<00:01:19.259> fast<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.580> you've<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> stroke

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
to swim fast then you've got the stroke

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.390 
to swim fast then you've got the stroke
meter<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.350> which<00:01:22.590> you've<00:01:22.799> got<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> really

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
meter in which you've got to really

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.890 
meter in which you've got to really
balance<00:01:23.640> how<00:01:24.090> fast<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:27.000> not

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
balance how fast you're going to not

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.319 
balance how fast you're going to not

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.530 
thing started alright so we don't have
to<00:01:58.799> bend<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.100> far<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.729> by<00:02:00.030> any<00:02:00.240> means

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
to bend that far down by any means

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.609 
to bend that far down by any means
because<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> could<00:02:02.479> go<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.509> real<00:02:04.020> fast<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
because it could go up real fast and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
because it could go up real fast and
reach<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.460> stutters<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.299> my<00:02:06.509> arm<00:02:06.750> angle

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
reach up with stutters and my arm angle

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
reach up with stutters and my arm angle
is<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> little<00:02:07.590> high

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
is a little high

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.540 
is a little high
not<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.940> optimal<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.160> do<00:02:11.340> now

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
not that optimal so all I have to do now

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.230 
not that optimal so all I have to do now
is<00:02:11.580> face

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
is face

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.820 
is face
you<00:02:12.480> say<00:02:12.690> puste<00:02:14.930> albright<00:02:15.930> got<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> little

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
you say puste albright got a little

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.600 
you say puste albright got a little
boost<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.140> am<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.680> first<00:02:20.010> place<00:02:20.250> at

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
boost there so I am in first place at

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.140 
boost there so I am in first place at
the<00:02:20.640> moment<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.860> waving<00:02:22.860> my<00:02:23.010> arms<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.850> going

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
too fast so I have no stem on a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.890 
too fast so I have no stem on a
twenty-percent<00:02:26.580> Stan<00:02:26.850> I'm<00:02:26.970> gonna<00:02:27.090> OH

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
twenty-percent Stan I'm gonna OH

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.140 
twenty-percent Stan I'm gonna OH
and<00:02:28.340> push<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.150> we're<00:02:30.270> going<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.450> push<00:02:30.600> out<00:02:30.810> by
