00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.649
 personal hello okay so I'm 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.830
 making a cornflour here 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.790
 victory bakery 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.400
 so the tip is if it comes with all the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 Here you have it here 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.730
 the sandwich options 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.449
 Only that there is one, but I'm going to do this. 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 and it was isolated and there in low 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 so what I see I noticed that the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.079
 growth time of these 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.480
 Bethany who is speaking in the manual 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.280
 Her time is very small so it is not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.379
 you are doing is wrong 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 What she is talking about is happening. 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.020
 because it is not the time of the manual is not the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 sufficient for the pasta to grow 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.590
 so when she before she begins to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 I'll do the following, I'll turn it off. 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:07.080
 was totally disconnected from power on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:09.710
 outlet I also say it and hope to grow 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 Then I put this chicane so here. 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 Batch lid 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.549
 Sometimes it grows even more 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.950
 even more than I should have then I saw a 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:29.009
 video here on youtube 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.799
 the eye of the young man who taught 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.040
 even to know it may be you give a 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.470
 look at his video and the super tip 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.630
 good because it grows as good tone 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.880
 child so he can not get 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.740
 really he did not catch it 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.250
 grow up and guy the top then and when he 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.950
 grow when he has grown enough 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.460
 that I want everything I want when 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460
 he grows 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.880
 I put on the cycle as I understood 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.229
 put her not get bored and instead of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.260
 make a program enter option 12 and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.390
 so I'll see I 'm going to try and maybe I 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.000
 Can you put it on after roasting ok? 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.670
 ok then 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.440
 So the folks I talked to you about here. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.100
 is the ready - made bread is he stayed in 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.400
 option 12 which is one hour was much higher 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.160
 she stays you want him what else 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.590
 clear take away so the 10 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.890
 minutes before it will be 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 alone my sister the same way here 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 Here's how I let you grow a lot. 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.709
 can see that with a hole and I already 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.709
 tasted with great gusto 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.500
 I'll show you how it got soft 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.650
 It's good to know very well. 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.750
 with this technique can not err as 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.840
 I told you where to put a 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.840
 cloth up here when you make the 1 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.180
 leave the cloth I 've heard someone say 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 who burned all in front of the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.050
 bakery voting with ours is to assemble 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.790
 a little school some dishcloths yes in 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:39.750
 so edge where to stay here higher and 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:45.500
 so I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.500
