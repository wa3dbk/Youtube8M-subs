00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
do a little square you don't need a lot

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.490 
do a little square you don't need a lot
of<00:03:16.939> glue<00:03:17.209> that's<00:03:17.900> plenty

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
of glue that's plenty

I take my magic pick and I just randomly

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.390 
I take my magic pick and I just randomly
pick<00:03:28.340> between<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.030> 16s<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> 12<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.920> these

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:43.260 

and<00:03:34.870> fly<00:03:35.870> them<00:03:38.829> whoo

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.850 

now<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.540> you've<00:03:44.720> seen<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.200> application

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
now that you've seen the application

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.300 
now that you've seen the application
techniques<00:03:46.340> I<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:47.090> few<00:03:47.360> tips<00:03:47.600> for<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.310> tip

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
techniques I have a few tips for you tip

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.960 
techniques I have a few tips for you tip
number<00:03:49.490> one<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:51.650> sure<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.100> do<00:03:52.310> sections<00:03:52.819> at

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
number one make sure you do sections at

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.090 
number one make sure you do sections at
a<00:03:53.000> time<00:03:53.090> if<00:03:53.690> you're<00:03:53.930> starting<00:03:54.410> for<00:03:54.770> your<00:03:54.860> first

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
a time if you're starting for your first

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.220 
a time if you're starting for your first
time<00:03:55.400> on<00:03:55.580> projects<00:03:56.090> like<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.690> would<00:03:56.930> start

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
time on projects like this I would start

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.740 
time on projects like this I would start
with<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.380> little<00:03:57.740> square<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.520> then<00:03:59.209> as<00:03:59.390> you<00:03:59.570> get

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
with a little square and then as you get

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.960 
with a little square and then as you get
braver<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.770> can<00:04:00.950> do<00:04:01.070> bigger<00:04:01.310> squares<00:04:01.730> I

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
braver you can do bigger squares I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.520 
braver you can do bigger squares I
started<00:04:02.330> out<00:04:02.420> really<00:04:02.600> little<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.080> then<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.320> got

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
started out really little and then I got

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.320 
started out really little and then I got
really<00:04:03.800> big<00:04:04.010> into<00:04:04.280> my<00:04:04.430> squares<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:05.209> have

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
really big into my squares you just have

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.130 
really big into my squares you just have
to<00:04:05.420> be<00:04:05.540> quick<00:04:05.750> with<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:06.610> number<00:04:07.610> two<00:04:08.030> on<00:04:08.360> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
to be quick with that number two on the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.590 
to be quick with that number two on the
magic<00:04:09.530> pick<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:10.400> will<00:04:10.580> lose<00:04:10.790> its<00:04:10.970> tackiness

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
magic pick it will lose its tackiness

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.690 
magic pick it will lose its tackiness
after<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.140> few<00:04:12.410> pick<00:04:12.650> ups<00:04:12.860> but<00:04:13.520> there's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
after a few pick ups but there's

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.370 
after a few pick ups but there's
directions<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.390> back<00:04:14.540> how<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:14.930> get<00:04:15.200> the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
directions on the back how to get the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.830 
directions on the back how to get the
tackiness<00:04:15.800> back<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:16.970> really<00:04:17.269> easy<00:04:17.480> so<00:04:17.630> you

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
tackiness back it's really easy so you

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.409 
tackiness back it's really easy so you
just<00:04:17.989> follow<00:04:18.140> those<00:04:18.380> directions<00:04:19.419> number

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
just follow those directions number

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.540 
just follow those directions number
three<00:04:20.750> with<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.799> syringe<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:24.500> e6000<00:04:25.400> does

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
three with this syringe the e6000 does

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.850 
three with this syringe the e6000 does
not<00:04:25.790> clean<00:04:26.150> out<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.600> very<00:04:26.840> well<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.560> would

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
not clean out of it very well so I would

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.350 
not clean out of it very well so I would
suggest<00:04:28.160> buying<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.700> couple<00:04:28.940> if<00:04:29.150> you're<00:04:29.270> going

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
suggest buying a couple if you're going

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.420 
suggest buying a couple if you're going
to<00:04:29.450> start<00:04:30.140> your<00:04:30.260> project<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.980> then<00:04:31.070> finish

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
to start your project and then finish

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.130 
to start your project and then finish
later<00:04:31.730> unless<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.300> do<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.510> all<00:04:32.780> in<00:04:32.960> one

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
later unless you do it all in one

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.870 
later unless you do it all in one
project<00:04:33.380> but<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:33.950> did<00:04:34.160> take<00:04:34.340> me<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.550> few<00:04:34.820> hours

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880

project but this did take me a few hours
to<00:04:35.150> do<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:37.669> then<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.750> last<00:04:38.930> tip<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.650> when<00:04:40.100> I

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
and I just picked up whatever rhinestone

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.909 
and I just picked up whatever rhinestone
there<00:04:50.720> was<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:52.040> put<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:52.400> there<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:53.210> make<00:04:53.390> it

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
there was to put it on there to make it

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:02.410 
there was to put it on there to make it
complete<00:04:54.919> like<00:04:55.190> that

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.550 

and<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:03.050> glue<00:05:03.350> dries<00:05:04.040> fairly<00:05:04.550> quick<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.560> would

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
and the glue dries fairly quick I would

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.890 
and the glue dries fairly quick I would
give<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:06.830> 24<00:05:07.100> hours<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:10.790> then<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.300> polish<00:05:11.690> this

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
give it 24 hours and then to polish this

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.470 
give it 24 hours and then to polish this
