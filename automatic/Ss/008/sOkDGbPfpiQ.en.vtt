ones would have and then you also have a
manual<00:00:55.550> aperture<00:00:56.030> ring<00:00:56.359> which<00:00:57.289> is<00:00:57.530> right

manual aperture ring which is right

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.220 
manual aperture ring which is right
along<00:00:58.249> here<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:58.850> goes<00:00:59.059> from<00:00:59.179> f-14<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
along here and this goes from f-14 to

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.479 
along here and this goes from f-14 to
f-22<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:02.289> there's<00:01:03.289> individual<00:01:04.010> click<00:01:04.250> stop

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
f-22 and there's individual click stop

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.800 
f-22 and there's individual click stop
so<00:01:04.760> I'm<00:01:04.879> gonna<00:01:04.970> get<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.300> closer<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
so I'm gonna get this closer to the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.450 
so I'm gonna get this closer to the
microphone<00:01:05.990> here<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.770> have<00:01:09.920> individual

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
microphone here so you have individual

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.820 
microphone here so you have individual
click<00:01:10.640> stops<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:11.150> let<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.450> basically<00:01:12.380> know<00:01:12.650> so

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
click stops to let you basically know so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.810 
click stops to let you basically know so
when<00:01:12.950> you're<00:01:13.100> shooting<00:01:13.430> with<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.640> lens<00:01:13.850> and

I'm at at f-14

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.940 
I'm at at f-14
aperture<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:20.510> know<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.080> get<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.320> close<00:01:21.530> down<00:01:21.740> just

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950

a<00:01:22.010> little<00:01:22.040> bit<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.430> maybe<00:01:22.550> f-18<00:01:23.180> or<00:01:23.210> f-22<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:24.080> can

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
a little bit to maybe f-18 or f-22 I can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.530 
a little bit to maybe f-18 or f-22 I can
just<00:01:24.710> go<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.430> click<00:01:25.670> stops<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.120> know<00:01:26.180> I'm<00:01:26.390> an

just go to click stops and I know I'm an
f-22<00:01:26.930> or<00:01:27.350> if<00:01:27.440> I<00:01:27.530> go<00:01:27.680> one<00:01:27.830> more<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.280> know<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.730> I'm

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
f-22 or if I go one more I know and I'm

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.030 
f-22 or if I go one more I know and I'm
at<00:01:28.940> f28<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.260> if<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.440> need<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.710> start<00:01:30.920> over

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
at f28 and if I need to start over

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.530 
at f28 and if I need to start over
without<00:01:31.400> having<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.850> look<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.180> can<00:01:32.300> just<00:01:32.330> go<00:01:32.510> to

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
without having to look I can just go to

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.930 
without having to look I can just go to
f-14<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.320> then<00:01:33.890> count<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.520> know<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.850> I'm

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
f-14 and then count and I know and I'm

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.740 
f-14 and then count and I know and I'm
at<00:01:35.090> f-22<00:01:35.690> or<00:01:35.810> f28<00:01:36.730> so<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:38.060> lens<00:01:38.240> basically

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
at f-22 or f28 so the lens basically

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.840 
at f-22 or f28 so the lens basically
they<00:01:39.230> have<00:01:39.350> mounts<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:40.010> different<00:01:40.520> cameras

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
which is for third system so it should

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.670 
which is for third system so it should
fit<00:01:45.500> Panasonic<00:01:46.070> as<00:01:46.190> well<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.440> fully

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
fit Panasonic as well it's a fully

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.140 
fit Panasonic as well it's a fully
manual<00:01:48.890> lens<00:01:49.190> that<00:01:49.370> doesn't<00:01:49.580> always<00:01:49.730> have<00:01:50.000> all

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
manual lens that doesn't always have all

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.760 
manual lens that doesn't always have all
the<00:01:50.180> intelligence<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.170> send<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.620> the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
the intelligence in it to send to the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.500 
the intelligence in it to send to the
camera<00:01:52.160> so<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:52.790> case<00:01:53.030> when<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.240> use<00:01:53.480> it

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
camera so in this case when I use it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.120 
camera so in this case when I use it
with<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> camera<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.320> either<00:01:54.470> keep<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.830> camera

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
with the camera I either keep the camera

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.280 
with the camera I either keep the camera
in<00:01:55.220> manual<00:01:55.370> mode<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> aperture

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.070 
able to see some in and out of focus
areas<00:03:07.819> that<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.180> were<00:03:08.299> hoping<00:03:08.480> where<00:03:08.780> we're

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
areas that you were hoping where we're

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.990 
areas that you were hoping where we're
super<00:03:09.349> sharp<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:10.310> when<00:03:10.430> you're<00:03:10.549> talking<00:03:10.730> with

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
super sharp but when you're talking with

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.690 
super sharp but when you're talking with
an<00:03:11.090> 85<00:03:11.390> millimeter<00:03:11.840> lens<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:13.340> depth<00:03:13.580> of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
an 85 millimeter lens your depth of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.309 
an 85 millimeter lens your depth of
field<00:03:13.879> is<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.209> shallow<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:14.930> because<00:03:15.170> you

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
field is so shallow just because you

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.740 
field is so shallow just because you
zoom<00:03:16.099> tends<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.610> compress<00:03:16.730> depth<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.269> field<00:03:17.450> as

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
zoom tends to compress depth of field as

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.490 
zoom tends to compress depth of field as
does<00:03:18.019> obviously<00:03:18.230> going<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.829> a<00:03:18.920> wider<00:03:19.579> aperture

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
does obviously going to a wider aperture

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.990 
does obviously going to a wider aperture
but<00:03:21.500> because<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> depth<00:03:22.069> of<00:03:22.610> field<00:03:22.879> is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
but because the depth of field is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.850 
but because the depth of field is
shallow<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.750> very<00:03:23.989> easy<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.440> tell<00:03:24.620> when

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
shallow it's very easy to tell when

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.170 
shallow it's very easy to tell when
you're<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.220> out<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.430> focus<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:25.910> manually

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you're in and out of focus so manually

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.970 
you're in and out of focus so manually
