00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.530
 be all very welcome to this new 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.780
 tutorial going back to the emt 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.320
 i am android also known as does 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.619
 about 10 teaching how to do jumps or 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.550
 maybe redirected jumps 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.490
 for a map an example of this would be 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.820
 this they see but here again I re 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:39.370
 directions but I only did the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.290
 good jump let's continue with the tutorial if 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.180
 well cut is because I'm recording 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.120
 only with Captain Kan you are already 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.269
 so please do not claim and you see 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.040
 slow and the first thing will be to download this 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.890
 real point file called jump 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.640
 they decompress it and it has a jump file 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.280
 point place 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 if we open up we see what it says here where 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 it says gravity jump comes out xyz that are the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.430
 coordinates where we're going to put our 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.550
 they see her 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.550
 they put it in their map folder 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.190
 first they make the map they keep that in 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.270
 my case is called action 23 z is the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.040
 true here where it goes with everything xml 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.740
 they do not edit it with a notepad or they do not know 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.740
 they put this script 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.759
 call it that of the two techniques that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:40.329
 they are next to the zeta 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:42.830
 script src is equal open quotes 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:48.549
 we put the name and a fifth place 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:52.939
 closing of type space is equal to quote 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:57.480
 click byword quotes is the dge 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:00.710
 and the other of these but the opposite 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.710
 and they will save 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 that when the script is already 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 inside the map 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.380
 once done that we edit the jump here 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.810
 putting the coordinates here that if 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.380
 in my case I already had it on but 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.599
 these are taken out here and put a crown 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.590
 it has to be a crown because if they put 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.950
 another one here should change it 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.710
 and there are the x coordinates 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.770
 y and the z that are set here 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:45.460
 these are the same and have a gravity 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.700
 yung-jan 2 in case you need two 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.730
 and there is a time having that already have the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.950
 jump script a de facto goal for 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.470
 redirect it or I know how to do the jump 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.470
 here is a little bit more complicated 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.470
 why 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:10.510
 here as they realize they are not the x 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.040
 but there is the yy the z only 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.480
 because the x I guess it's always 0 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 here if this does not change it 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.599
 here the and it's like inverted with the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.780
 here are not they are not naming with the 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.120
 and the X and the mushrooms I do not carry with me and 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.530
 the blue the zeta 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.530
 in the red or green 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.190
 to see and see 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.900
 it seems that the green already but I 'm not 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.019
 safe 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:53.239
 but the function of there is that the car 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:57.110
 double towards the horizon or if you 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.530
 I put 10 I think he's going to jump out 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.630
 and the zeta makes the car jump towards 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.340
 up because it's impossible to jump 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.580
 down if you zero the car 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.580
 it's going to crash 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.430
 here put vale is the and let's put some 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.920
 two and who the z is going to put a 1 no 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.140
 we're just going to save 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.829
 and we can calmly test our 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.319
 Map 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.319
 to the fucking mother f5 only 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.420
 here we are but do not see 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.970
 too slow to go through the sea that 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.420
 pull us to the side I came here 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.100
 should calculate more or less with the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.330
 baits with my other tutorials he taught 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.000
 how to calculate things 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.280
 we'd be doing if they want another 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.560
 the same only with the one below with 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.710
 this one and with this to modify s 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.400
 and this church like 2 subscribe if it is 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.400
 goodbye
