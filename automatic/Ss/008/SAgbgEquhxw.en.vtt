one<00:00:53.250> day<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.640> decided<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
one day and decided that I was going to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.130 
one day and decided that I was going to
rebuild<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.250> him<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
rebuild it for him so this is the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.290 
rebuild it for him so this is the
progress<00:00:58.410> thus<00:00:59.010> far<00:00:59.300> I<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.870> did<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> mock

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
progress thus far I just did a mock

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.200 
progress thus far I just did a mock
build<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.790> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> pieced<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
build up if you will I kind of pieced it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
build up if you will I kind of pieced it
back<00:01:06.390> together<00:01:06.540> real<00:01:06.900> rough<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
back together real rough to get a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.800 
back together real rough to get a
general<00:01:08.040> idea<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.150> look<00:01:09.299> like

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.899 

see<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.950> gas<00:01:14.310> tank<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.880> painted<00:01:16.400> mm<00:01:17.400> where's

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
see the gas tank is painted mm where's

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.100 
see the gas tank is painted mm where's
that<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:23.240> basically<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.390> rust<00:01:24.810> killer

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that at it's a basically a rust killer

rust oleum rust reformer the gas tank
and<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.049> fly<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.590> cover<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.340> severely

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and the fly will cover actually severely

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
and the fly will cover actually severely
rusted<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> flywheel<00:01:38.630> however<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
rusted as was the flywheel however this

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.240 
rusted as was the flywheel however this
stuff<00:01:40.400> literally<00:01:41.400> covered<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> rust<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
stuff literally covered up the rust and

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.899 
stuff literally covered up the rust and
has<00:01:44.250> given<00:01:44.579> me<00:01:44.670> zero<00:01:44.700> issues<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:47.520> sort<00:01:47.790> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
tape and painted over everything I got

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.760

in<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:02.909> nooks<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.210> crannies<00:02:03.770> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
in all the little nooks and crannies it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.170 
in all the little nooks and crannies it
was<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.189> bit<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.460> running<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:06.030> it's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
was a little bit of running but it's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.760 
was a little bit of running but it's
very<00:02:06.509> minimal<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.170> could<00:02:07.350> probably<00:02:07.530> just

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
very minimal and I could probably just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.820 
very minimal and I could probably just
sand<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
sand it out and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.380 
sand it out and
then<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:14.420> air<00:02:14.840> cleaner<00:02:15.220> cover<00:02:16.220> your<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.300> air

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
then the air cleaner cover your the air

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.110 
then the air cleaner cover your the air

rust<00:03:17.989> remover<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.870> everything<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:23.450> engine

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
rust remover and everything the engine

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.430 
rust remover and everything the engine
originally<00:03:24.680> when<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> got<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.030> had<00:03:26.750> powder

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
originally when I got to it had powder

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.960 
originally when I got to it had powder
coat<00:03:27.769> all<00:03:27.980> over<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:31.130> looks<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.550> bit<00:03:31.730> rough

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
coat all over it so it looks a bit rough

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.030 
coat all over it so it looks a bit rough
but<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:33.019> used<00:03:33.790> aircraft<00:03:34.790> remover<00:03:36.040> aircraft

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
but I used aircraft remover aircraft

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.640 
but I used aircraft remover aircraft
hanger<00:03:37.310> remover<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:39.110> bubbled

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
hanger remover on it and it bubbled

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.670 
hanger remover on it and it bubbled
right<00:03:39.830> off<00:03:40.870> at<00:03:41.870> least<00:03:41.989> all<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.320> nooks<00:03:42.470> and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
right off at least all the nooks and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.910 
right off at least all the nooks and
crannies<00:03:43.130> kind<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.090> leveled<00:03:44.390> off<00:03:44.709> most<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.860> the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
crannies kind of leveled off most of the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.490 
crannies kind of leveled off most of the
paint<00:03:46.160> was<00:03:46.280> removed<00:03:46.670> with<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.269> wire<00:03:47.750> brush

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.220 

actually<00:03:51.880> this<00:03:52.880> wire<00:03:53.150> brush<00:03:53.540> it's<00:03:53.930> kind<00:03:54.110> of

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
actually this wire brush it's kind of

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.080 
actually this wire brush it's kind of
mangled<00:03:54.590> now<00:03:54.739> not<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> lot<00:03:55.550> of<00:03:55.640> work<00:03:55.760> on<00:03:55.940> it

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
mangled now not a lot of work on it

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.199 
mangled now not a lot of work on it
probably<00:03:56.450> got<00:03:57.280> at<00:03:58.280> least<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.610> day's<00:03:58.790> worth<00:03:59.060> of

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
probably got at least a day's worth of

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.500 
probably got at least a day's worth of
work<00:03:59.269> in<00:03:59.570> this<00:03:59.750> just<00:04:00.500> detailing<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.700> peddling

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
work in this just detailing and peddling

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.370 
work in this just detailing and peddling
around<00:04:02.810> until<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.260> could<00:04:03.500> get<00:04:04.870> some<00:04:05.870> stuff

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
around until I could get some stuff

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.850 
around until I could get some stuff
ordered<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:09.019> only<00:04:09.260> problem<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.650> found

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
ordered for it the only problem I found

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.090 
ordered for it the only problem I found
with<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.100> engine<00:04:10.549> internally<00:04:11.230> was<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
with the engine internally was the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:21.030 
with the engine internally was the
exhaust<00:04:13.580> valve<00:04:16.209> see<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.359> intake<00:04:18.549> think

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
exhaust valve see this intake think

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.820 
exhaust valve see this intake think
yes<00:04:24.180> yes<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.450> exhaust<00:04:26.110> found<00:04:26.380> it's<00:04:26.530> hard<00:04:26.710> to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
yes yes the exhaust found it's hard to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.660 
yes yes the exhaust found it's hard to
see<00:04:27.240> but<00:04:28.560> that's<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.710> exhaust<00:04:30.040> bow<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
see but that's the exhaust bow this is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.800 
see but that's the exhaust bow this is
the<00:04:30.820> intake<00:04:31.210> valve<00:04:33.000> exhaust<00:04:34.000> valves<00:04:34.330> burnt<00:04:34.600> up

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
the intake valve exhaust valves burnt up

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.950 
the intake valve exhaust valves burnt up
a<00:04:34.930> little<00:04:35.140> bit<00:04:35.730> because<00:04:36.730> we<00:04:36.940> ran<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.510> around

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
a little bit because we ran it around

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.370 
a little bit because we ran it around
the<00:04:38.080> go-kart<00:04:38.470> without<00:04:38.920> a<00:04:39.810> muffler<00:04:40.810> for<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.170> bit

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
the go-kart without a muffler for a bit

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.290 
the go-kart without a muffler for a bit
that's<00:04:41.770> missing<00:04:42.460> right<00:04:42.490> now<00:04:42.670> because<00:04:43.150> I'm

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
that's missing right now because I'm

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.140 
that's missing right now because I'm
going<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.450> make<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.630> custom<00:04:44.140> one<00:04:44.200> soon<00:04:45.120> but<00:04:46.120> I

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
going to make a custom one soon but I

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.080 
going to make a custom one soon but I
actually<00:04:46.300> had<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.630> file<00:04:46.930> down<00:04:47.640> this<00:04:48.640> part<00:04:48.970> of

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
actually had to file down this part of

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.090 
actually had to file down this part of
the<00:04:49.180> valve<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.900> remove<00:04:50.470> it<00:04:50.620> from<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.890> ain't

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
the valve to remove it from the ain't

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.570 
the valve to remove it from the ain't
that<00:04:51.280> from<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.640> block<00:04:51.880> itself<00:04:53.190> because<00:04:54.190> it

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
that from the block itself because it

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.310 
that from the block itself because it
had<00:04:54.730> kind<00:04:55.030> of<00:04:55.890> gotten<00:04:56.890> damaged<00:04:57.430> due<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.480> cold

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
had kind of gotten damaged due to cold

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.500 
had kind of gotten damaged due to cold
air<00:04:59.530> hitting<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:01.230> inside<00:05:02.230> of<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:03.790> exhaust

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
air hitting the inside of the exhaust

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.550 
air hitting the inside of the exhaust
port<00:05:06.300> because<00:05:07.300> there<00:05:07.750> was<00:05:07.900> no<00:05:08.020> exhaust<00:05:08.320> on<00:05:08.530> it

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
port because there was no exhaust on it

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.710 
port because there was no exhaust on it
and<00:05:08.830> what<00:05:09.610> that<00:05:09.760> does<00:05:09.910> is<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.120> just<00:05:10.390> warps

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
and what that does is it just warps

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.750 
and what that does is it just warps
everything<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:11.980> causes<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:13.570> exhaust

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
everything and it causes the exhaust

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.420 
everything and it causes the exhaust
valve<00:05:15.760> to<00:05:16.030> kind<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.240> slam<00:05:16.540> ah<00:05:19.380> this<00:05:20.380> is<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.740> 521

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
valve to kind of slam ah this is it 521

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.610 
valve to kind of slam ah this is it 521
right<00:05:21.610> now<00:05:21.730> so<00:05:22.080> I'm<00:05:23.080> going<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.290> cut<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.530> video

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
right now so I'm going to cut the video

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.430 
right now so I'm going to cut the video
short<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.940> know<00:05:25.230> this<00:05:26.230> is<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:29.230> there's

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
short you know this is it and there's

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.980 
short you know this is it and there's
nothing<00:05:29.590> much<00:05:29.860> else<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.190> show<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.990> it's

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
nothing much else to show you it's

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.580 
nothing much else to show you it's
almost<00:05:32.890> complete<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.670> should<00:05:33.970> have<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.240> done
