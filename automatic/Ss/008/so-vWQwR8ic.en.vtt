cobblestone 5x5 sorry you know make 5x5

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100 
cobblestone 5x5 sorry you know make 5x5
block<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> cobblestone<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.750> you're<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
block of cobblestone and you're going to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
block of cobblestone and you're going to
milk<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:56.270> put<00:00:57.270> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
milk out this one here and then put in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
milk out this one here and then put in
four<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> corner<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
four there in the corner so you have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.330 
four there in the corner so you have
like<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.329> L<00:01:00.570> shape<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.260> V<00:01:02.010> shape

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
like a little like L shape a V shape

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.799 
like a little like L shape a V shape
kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.699> thing<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.149> V<00:01:03.329> shape<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
kind of thing actually a V shape and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.929 
kind of thing actually a V shape and
then<00:01:04.339> we're<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:05.880> going

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
then we're going to do is you're going

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.530 
then we're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:06.060> start<00:01:06.360> by<00:01:06.680> building<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.939> around

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
to start by building all the way around

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.190 
to start by building all the way around
there<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.570> kind<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> looks<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
there so that it kind of looks like that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
there so that it kind of looks like that
again<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.760> well

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
again if you can see that very well

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
again if you can see that very well
so<00:01:15.810> looks<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.990> you're<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so looks like that then you're going to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.749 
so looks like that then you're going to
put<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.490> there<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:22.189> one<00:01:23.189> one

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
put one there and one there then one one

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.090 
put one there and one there then one one
one<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:25.740> gonna<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.979> your

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
one there and now you're gonna get your

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
one there and now you're gonna get your
bucket<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> water<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:27.720> gonna<00:01:27.810> fill<00:01:28.020> em

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
bucket of water and you're gonna fill em

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.520 
bucket of water and you're gonna fill em
in<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.320> too<00:01:28.470> far<00:01:29.040> gaps<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> water

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
in it too far gaps there so the water

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
in it too far gaps there so the water
sort<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.829> pushes<00:01:32.189> downwards<00:01:32.670> Allah<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sort of pushes downwards Allah so you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.289 
sort of pushes downwards Allah so you
can<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> before<00:01:36.210> you

keep it cobblestone

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.360 
keep it cobblestone
you<00:02:13.020> need<00:02:13.200> definitely<00:02:13.830> need<00:02:13.920> these<00:02:14.130> two

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you need definitely need these two

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.040

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
blocks here to be cobblestone obviously

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.920 
blocks here to be cobblestone obviously
so<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.620> cobblestone<00:02:17.040> back<00:02:17.930> this

because<00:02:29.010> exactly<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> same<00:02:30.060> concept<00:02:30.540> but

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
because exactly the same concept but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.500 
because exactly the same concept but
yeah<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.710> bulky<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> does<00:02:33.210> do<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
yeah it's a bit bulky but it does do the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.840 
yeah it's a bit bulky but it does do the
job<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.470> saves<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.890> going<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.340> mining

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
