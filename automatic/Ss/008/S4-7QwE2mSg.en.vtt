the<00:00:17.890> human<00:00:18.220> element<00:00:18.640> is<00:00:18.790> a<00:00:18.850> critical<00:00:19.390> feature

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
the human element is a critical feature

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.350 
the human element is a critical feature
of<00:00:19.960> all<00:00:20.200> aspects<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:20.920> ship<00:00:21.220> or<00:00:21.490> system<00:00:22.000> design

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
of all aspects of ship or system design

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.590 
of all aspects of ship or system design
and<00:00:22.390> operation<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:24.279> any<00:00:24.460> ship<00:00:24.820> or<00:00:25.060> system<00:00:25.449> to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
and operation for any ship or system to

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.450 
and operation for any ship or system to
operate<00:00:25.750> safely<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.650> effectively

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
operate safely and effectively

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.250 
operate safely and effectively
it<00:00:27.699> must<00:00:28.060> be<00:00:28.180> designed<00:00:28.510> to<00:00:28.660> support<00:00:29.050> the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
it must be designed to support the

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.500 
it must be designed to support the
people<00:00:29.560> who<00:00:29.590> work<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:30.130> without<00:00:30.610> any<00:00:30.910> risk<00:00:31.270> to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
people who work it without any risk to

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.330 
people who work it without any risk to
their<00:00:31.630> health<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:32.050> safety<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.949> with<00:00:33.129> no

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
their health and safety and with no

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.890 
their health and safety and with no
negative<00:00:33.699> impact<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.510> their<00:00:34.720> overall

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
negative impact on their overall

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.860 
negative impact on their overall
performance<00:00:35.879> so<00:00:36.879> in<00:00:36.970> this<00:00:37.120> issue<00:00:37.330> of<00:00:37.480> alert

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
performance so in this issue of alert

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
performance so in this issue of alert
we're<00:00:38.440> going<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.650> be<00:00:38.710> looking<00:00:39.010> at<00:00:39.220> economics

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.569 

both<00:00:52.120> with<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.420> program<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.680> what<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:54.340> mean

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
both with the program so what do we mean

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.450 
both with the program so what do we mean
by<00:00:54.610> economics<00:00:55.450> well<00:00:56.260> it's<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.890> science<00:00:57.340> and

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
by economics well it's a science and

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.369 
by economics well it's a science and
designing<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.969> job<00:00:58.239> equipment<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.320> a

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
designing the job equipment in a

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.350 
designing the job equipment in a
workplace<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.219> fit<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.670> worker

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
workplace to fit the worker

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.330 
workplace to fit the worker
so<00:01:01.840> this<00:01:01.989> office<00:01:02.320> for<00:01:02.500> example<00:01:02.590> we<00:01:03.010> consider

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
so this office for example we consider

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.710 
so this office for example we consider
the<00:01:03.430> suitability<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.969> chair<00:01:04.330> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
the suitability of the chair the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.320 
the suitability of the chair the
position<00:01:05.020> of<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.170> desk<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.710> screen<00:01:06.330> but

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
position of the desk and screen but

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.670 
position of the desk and screen but
that's<00:01:07.479> so<00:01:07.570> very<00:01:07.750> well<00:01:08.020> if<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.259> work<00:01:08.440> in<00:01:08.590> an

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that's so very well if you work in an

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.490 
that's so very well if you work in an
office<00:01:08.800> every<00:01:09.190> day<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:10.570> board<00:01:10.810> ship<00:01:11.110> there

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
office every day one board ship there

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.990 
office every day one board ship there
are<00:01:11.590> many<00:01:11.800> more<00:01:11.979> things<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.369> consider

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
are many more things to consider

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.140 
are many more things to consider
a<00:01:14.410> ship<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.560> unique<00:01:15.860> because<00:01:16.220> not<00:01:16.520> only<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
a ship is unique because not only is the

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.000 
a ship is unique because not only is the
place<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.420> work<00:01:17.780> consisting<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.770> bridge
