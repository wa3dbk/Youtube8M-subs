00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
what the mod maker says now I believe

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.390 
what the mod maker says now I believe
you<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.819> do<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.000> some<00:02:29.450> sort<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.810> turning

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
you you do have some sort of turning

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.309 
you you do have some sort of turning
control<00:02:31.400> over<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.000> but<00:02:32.360> for<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.020> most<00:02:33.170> part

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
control over this but for the most part

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.800 
control over this but for the most part
it<00:02:34.280> will<00:02:34.489> tend<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.150> off<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.569> its<00:02:35.720> own

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it will tend to go off in its own

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.630 
it will tend to go off in its own
direction<00:02:36.319> but<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.500> doesn't<00:02:36.800> matter<00:02:36.890> as

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
direction but that doesn't matter as

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.070 
direction but that doesn't matter as
long<00:02:37.730> as<00:02:37.940> you're<00:02:38.060> able<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.330> jump<00:02:38.360> off<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
long as you're able to jump off of a

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.900
