 the hammer osten against westfalia rhynern 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.920
 Since then, both have joined forces in the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.960
 Oberliga Westphalia are active 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.020
 previously it had four draws and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.020
 a defeat since 2012/2013 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.089
 damir kurtovic had the golden goal ahead 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.979
 nearly 2000 spectators are watching in the evora arena 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.140
 already scored in the tenth minute 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.589

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.589
 start 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580
 With 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.440
 previously remember dangerous acted in place 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.960
 the third minute had thorben menne 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.790
 the 1 0 for the westfalia on the foot 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 the ahv age need one 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.400
 worth seeing action even earlier in 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.400
 leadership 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.219
 the frightful moment of the game takes place in 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.039
 the second half after the hsv actor 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.270
 miguel de toledo and tan tan tran with 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.119
 rattled their heads together 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.280
 both stayed for minutes while lying 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 the league is in the hospital 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.359
 the toledo could be driven against 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.780
 continue playing his ex-club and the 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.780
 celebrate victory 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.990
 happy has also again 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.210
 but see in such a derby is 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.689
 Of course, there are no friendships 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.689
 experience 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:21.500
 maybe not so good at the time 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.170
 celebration wildhouse 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.150
 I do not know when it needs very 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.150
 are aligned now well 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.950
 in the game in which there are also some derby 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.750
 Typical disputes gave them an appearance 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.730
 However, the final pressure was unsuccessful 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.030
 they lost one of them 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.030
 little happy 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.420
 I believe what the first half 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.150
 maybe only 95 of what 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.769
 we actually can 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.200
 they are back then 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.629
 at some point understood the fight extreme 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.269
 to take but unfortunately too late 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.709
 if you like a game that we have here where it is 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.599
 a little cute is what one 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.549
 bit disgusting of the player and you have 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.680
 really 34 big chances 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.180
 you just have to score that 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.790
 That's the way it is and then you do not lose 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.790
 are not you laughing at the making of the 10
