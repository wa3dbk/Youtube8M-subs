Paula meets just like that big feature
right<00:00:34.899> it<00:00:35.050> crosses<00:00:35.410> over<00:00:35.530> into<00:00:35.649> so<00:00:35.950> many<00:00:36.010> areas

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
right it crosses over into so many areas

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.090 
right it crosses over into so many areas
I'm<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.000> living<00:00:37.360> testimony<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.260> all<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.920> meat

I'm a living testimony to all the meat

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.430 
I'm a living testimony to all the meat
being<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.430> really<00:00:39.700> fun<00:00:40.120> mode<00:00:40.449> of<00:00:40.690> skateboarding

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
being a really fun mode of skateboarding

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.660 
being a really fun mode of skateboarding
we're<00:00:41.620> really<00:00:41.800> excited<00:00:42.040> about<00:00:42.250> it's<00:00:42.430> actually

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
we're really excited about it's actually

we're really excited about it's actually
one<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.850> more<00:00:42.910> fun<00:00:43.150> things<00:00:43.360> that<00:00:43.420> we're

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
one of the more fun things that we're

one of the more fun things that we're
doing<00:00:43.660> another<00:00:44.320> way<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.620> play

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.459 

our<00:00:49.460> guy<00:00:49.609> isn't<00:00:49.940> dead<00:00:50.269> when<00:00:50.539> he<00:00:50.690> wipes<00:00:50.870> up<00:00:51.109> it's

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
our guy isn't dead when he wipes up it's

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.049 
our guy isn't dead when he wipes up it's
not<00:00:51.620> like<00:00:51.769> a<00:00:51.829> loss<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.309> control<00:00:52.430> it's<00:00:52.820> still<00:00:53.030> a

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
not like a loss of control it's still a

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.169 
not like a loss of control it's still a
continuous<00:00:53.809> game<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:55.339> have<00:00:55.460> control<00:00:55.850> while

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
continuous game you have control while

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.719 
continuous game you have control while
he's<00:00:56.390> falling<00:00:56.839> to<00:00:57.079> let<00:00:57.350> spin<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.829> flip<00:00:58.550> own

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
he's falling to let spin a flip own

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.029 
he's falling to let spin a flip own
angle<00:00:59.479> him<00:00:59.600> back<00:00:59.839> you<00:01:00.530> can<00:01:00.649> use<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.859> left

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
angle him back you can use the left

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.229 
angle him back you can use the left
stick<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.280> actually<00:01:01.489> tweak<00:01:01.699> your<00:01:01.789> body<00:01:01.969> it's

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
stick to actually tweak your body it's

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.579 
stick to actually tweak your body it's
been<00:01:02.390> faster<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:02.839> faster<00:01:02.960> spin<00:01:03.409> any

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
been faster and faster spin any

in<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.110> same<00:01:06.140> direction<00:01:06.320> go<00:01:07.159> into<00:01:07.310> a

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
in the same direction go into a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.149 
in the same direction go into a
cannonball<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:09.259> counteract<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.799> spin

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
cannonball you can counteract that spin

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.399 
cannonball you can counteract that spin
by<00:01:10.340> pushing<00:01:10.549> one<00:01:10.850> way<00:01:11.000> open<00:01:11.750> up<00:01:11.840> your<00:01:11.960> body<00:01:12.170> to

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
by pushing one way open up your body to

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.880 
by pushing one way open up your body to
slow<00:01:12.619> down<00:01:12.770> your<00:01:13.009> spin

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.680 

we<00:01:18.340> always<00:01:18.520> had<00:01:18.760> great<00:01:18.940> physics<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.570> white

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
we always had great physics in the white

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.510 
we always had great physics in the white
boats<00:01:19.900> but<00:01:20.140> now<00:01:20.320> they've<00:01:20.560> really<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:21.040> come

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
boats but now they've really like come

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.110 
boats but now they've really like come
to<00:01:21.670> life

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.640 

just<00:01:24.270> having<00:01:24.870> control<00:01:25.170> while<00:01:25.410> you're<00:01:25.530> playing

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
just having control while you're playing

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.500 
just having control while you're playing
a<00:01:25.860> game<00:01:27.590> that's<00:01:28.590> awesome<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.390> once

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
a game that's awesome and then once

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.550 
a game that's awesome and then once
you're<00:01:30.630> actually<00:01:30.690> falling<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.260> was<00:01:31.380> cracking

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you're actually falling he was cracking

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.760 
you're actually falling he was cracking
up<00:01:32.480> when<00:01:33.480> you've<00:01:33.630> left<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.020> ground<00:01:34.260> too<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
up when you've left the ground too you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.960 
up when you've left the ground too you
hit<00:01:34.980> the<00:01:35.100> ground<00:01:35.190> how<00:01:35.430> far<00:01:35.730> did<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> actually

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
hit the ground how far did you actually

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.540 
hit the ground how far did you actually
fall<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.660> down<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.770> centimeter<00:01:38.370> for

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
fall like down to the one centimeter for

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.110 
fall like down to the one centimeter for
all<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.760> Canadians<00:01:39.300> up<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:41.430> speed<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:42.060> which

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
all you Canadians up the speed at which

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.410 
all you Canadians up the speed at which
you<00:01:42.660> bail

Ronnie dragged on the ground in the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
Ronnie dragged on the ground in the
intensity<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.840> impact<00:01:49.140> within<00:01:49.470> the

to wrist finger or did your wrist hit
first<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> rolled<00:01:54.630> over

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
first and then you kind of rolled over

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
first and then you kind of rolled over
onto<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.080> elbow<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.890> actually<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.189> the
