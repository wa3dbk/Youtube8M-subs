made an impression on me soon at the
middle<00:03:19.830> school<00:03:20.040> we<00:03:20.430> went<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.910> Roman

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
middle school we went on to Roman

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.130 
middle school we went on to Roman
Catholic<00:03:21.930> school<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.890> because<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:24.140> a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
Catholic school not because of a

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.080 
Catholic school not because of a
personal<00:03:25.830> belief<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.310> went<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:26.880> as

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
personal belief that went there as

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.240 
personal belief that went there as
Catholics<00:03:27.660> Christians<00:03:28.440> or<00:03:28.830> whatever<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.160> was

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
Catholics Christians or whatever it was

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.980 
Catholics Christians or whatever it was
just<00:03:29.310> because<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> went<00:03:30.060> there<00:03:30.240> my<00:03:30.630> parents

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
just because I went there my parents

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.500 
just because I went there my parents
sent<00:03:31.170> me<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:32.220> get<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.820> better<00:03:33.300> education

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
sent me there to get a better education

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.300 
sent me there to get a better education
I<00:03:34.020> would<00:03:34.200> than<00:03:34.470> other<00:03:34.890> stay<00:03:35.160> school<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
I would than other stay school and it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.480 
I would than other stay school and it
was<00:03:38.430> there<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.959> my<00:03:39.959> mind<00:03:40.230> really<00:03:40.950> started<00:03:41.400> to

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
was there that my mind really started to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.800 
was there that my mind really started to
question<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:44.190> Trinitarian<00:03:45.060> concepts<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.630> God

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
question the Trinitarian concepts of God

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.520 
question the Trinitarian concepts of God
again<00:03:47.870> how<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.500> man<00:03:50.070> could<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:51.530> God

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
again how is it that man could be God

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.830 
again how is it that man could be God
and<00:03:52.830> God<00:03:53.160> could<00:03:53.310> man<00:03:53.610> having<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.420> worn<00:03:54.660> in

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
and God could man having to be worn in

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.660 
and God could man having to be worn in
free<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.380> frame<00:03:55.620> 1<00:03:55.860> versus<00:03:56.190> ultimate

free and frame 1 versus ultimate

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.050 
free and frame 1 versus ultimate
confusion

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.370 

I<00:04:02.090> reject<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.500> point<00:04:03.830> where<00:04:05.110> when<00:04:06.110> we<00:04:06.200> had

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
I reject this to point where when we had

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.470 
I reject this to point where when we had

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
Christianity cannibalism so this was

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.909 
Christianity cannibalism so this was
kind<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.650> up<00:04:36.919> Horan<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:39.080> also<00:04:39.410> I<00:04:39.440> couldn't
