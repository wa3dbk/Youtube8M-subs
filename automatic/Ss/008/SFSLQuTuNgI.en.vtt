pattern and if you guys were wondering
it<00:02:11.990> does<00:02:12.170> work<00:02:12.380> on<00:02:12.560> both<00:02:12.710> retina<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.250> well<00:02:13.430> as

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
it does work on both retina as well as

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.850 
it does work on both retina as well as
non-retina<00:02:13.880> devices<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.600> my<00:02:15.080> 3gs<00:02:15.440> here<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.830> a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
non-retina devices as my 3gs here is a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.900 
non-retina devices as my 3gs here is a
non-retina<00:02:16.250> device<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.230> also<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.550> cool<00:02:19.700> thing

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
non-retina device so also the cool thing

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.520 
non-retina device so also the cool thing
is<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.090> only<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.600> icon<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.140> right<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
is that only the icon is right in the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.820 
is that only the icon is right in the
center<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:22.130> little<00:02:22.460> bit<00:02:22.550> zoomed<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.970> has

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
center and a little bit zoomed in has

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.550 
center and a little bit zoomed in has
the<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.700> icon<00:02:25.090> label<00:02:25.450> underneath<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.260> do

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
the little icon label underneath so I do

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.740 
the little icon label underneath so I do
think<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:26.950> looks<00:02:27.310> very<00:02:27.520> nice<00:02:27.760> now<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.450> guys

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
think that looks very nice now you guys

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.990

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
can get this from like the hack your

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.120 
can get this from like the hack your
iphone<00:02:31.030> repository<00:02:31.900> in<00:02:32.080> cydia<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.920> i'm<00:02:33.010> sure

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
iphone repository in cydia but i'm sure

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.980 
iphone repository in cydia but i'm sure
a<00:02:33.160> bunch<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.490> other<00:02:33.640> repositories<00:02:33.940> also<00:02:34.510> carry

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
a bunch of other repositories also carry

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.230 
a bunch of other repositories also carry
it<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.710> if<00:02:35.860> i<00:02:35.950> open<00:02:36.100> up<00:02:36.310> overflow<00:02:36.760> here<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.120> can

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
it so if i open up overflow here you can

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.910 
it so if i open up overflow here you can
basically<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.780> enable<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.290> disable<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
basically just enable and disable it and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.620 
basically just enable and disable it and
if<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.430> use<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> with<00:02:39.820> infinidock<00:02:40.210> i

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
if you use it with infinidock i

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.960 
if you use it with infinidock i
recommend<00:02:41.380> having<00:02:41.500> like<00:02:41.740> an<00:02:41.860> odd<00:02:42.040> number<00:02:42.250> like

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
recommend having like an odd number like

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.890 
recommend having like an odd number like
either<00:02:43.890> 357<00:02:45.060> or<00:02:46.060> something<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.540> so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
either 357 or something like that so

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.990 
either 357 or something like that so
that<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.320> either<00:02:48.010> two<00:02:48.370> or<00:02:48.400> three<00:02:48.670> icons

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
that you have either two or three icons

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.040 
that you have either two or three icons
on<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.240> side<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.570> one<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.870> middle

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
on the side and one in the middle

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.140 
on the side and one in the middle
