00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:11.200
 the area the fall is 49 5 promoted does not change in other rainy days is 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.689
 just to clean the windshield 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:18.669
 with this here I will confess to having the Brazilian area to take a look to see 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.610
 if she is no longer resected with the injury that impaired to have a vision 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.609
 the driver himself only a thin gun film 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.130
 concentrated driving at night reflects the light 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.800
 in the car that was going in the opposite direction the next step that I have that can 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.950
 happen and the trepidation or is on the way to higher 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.949
 with the same on the windshield 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.270
 put a new one of paiva the attempts have real eye drops 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.970
 for several available models the most important one is to consult the table that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.410
 the right sports car for your car 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.270
 you can also check the back of the packages to ensure the right pressure 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.660
 of the wall on the windshield 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.570
 if you like novelty this story that improves income 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.509
 this power makes the time pass 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.639
 over the vane to press against the race by the hard 30 to 40% more of the 

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.840
 than a conventional relative what she has 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.710
 this structure presided over 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.510
 which distributes arm force evenly over the windshield 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.740
 increase in psi performance 20 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.750
 and also preventive maintenance 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 the crops suffer with accumulation of dirt and very simple care I said 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 for anyone told me at the end of the palette 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.840
 excellent any kind of chemical product and that only it can enter 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.679
 the rubber on the pallet and shortening the life of the 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.990
 the last detail if the car has doubts or make changes to the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.670
 match 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.500
 at the same time of the substitution, 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
 always leaves you with 100% vision 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.000
 to nothing
