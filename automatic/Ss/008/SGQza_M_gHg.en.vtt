kind<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.399> leaves<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.880> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
kind of it kind of leaves like like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.620 
kind of it kind of leaves like like
clumpy<00:02:07.380> bits<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.459> brush<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> may

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
clumpy bits on the brush if that may

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.760 
clumpy bits on the brush if that may

the<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:15.030> gel<00:02:15.600> liner<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.290> my<00:02:16.470> eyelid<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> find<00:02:17.580> I

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
the the gel liner to my eyelid I find I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.010 
the the gel liner to my eyelid I find I
find<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.580> leaves<00:02:20.790> my<00:02:21.180> my<00:02:21.660> gel<00:02:21.990> liner

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
find that it leaves my my gel liner

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.970 
find that it leaves my my gel liner
looking<00:02:22.740> very<00:02:23.010> very<00:02:23.600> streaky<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.530> doesn't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
looking very very streaky and it doesn't

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.310 
looking very very streaky and it doesn't
give<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.550> smooth<00:02:27.180> line<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.080> get

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
give like a smooth line that you get

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.190 
give like a smooth line that you get
with<00:02:28.590> brushes<00:02:29.130> normally<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.900> you're

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
with brushes normally and if you're

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.160 
with brushes normally and if you're
doing<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> thicker<00:02:32.160> line<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.240> line<00:02:33.510> does

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
doing like a thicker line the line does

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.740 
doing like a thicker line the line does
smooth<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:35.100> bit<00:02:35.340> more<00:02:35.610> because<00:02:36.270> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
smooth out a little bit more because of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.900 
smooth out a little bit more because of
your<00:02:37.230> putting<00:02:37.440> pressure<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.610> if

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
your putting pressure on it but if

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.790 
your putting pressure on it but if
you're<00:02:39.390> trying<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:39.960> like<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> very<00:02:40.500> very

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
you're trying to do like a very very

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.250 
you're trying to do like a very very
fine<00:02:41.190> line<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.880> find<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.570> comes<00:02:42.810> out<00:02:42.960> very

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
fine line I find that it comes out very

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.360 
fine line I find that it comes out very
very<00:02:43.410> patchy<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:45.920> product<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.340> use

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
very patchy the product that you use

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
very patchy the product that you use
obviously<00:02:47.940> has<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> little<00:02:48.780> bit<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.990> do<00:02:49.140> with

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
obviously has a little bit to do with

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.370 
obviously has a little bit to do with
that<00:02:49.320> as<00:02:49.470> well<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.120> I'm<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.570> also<00:02:52.140> show

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
that as well so I'm going to also show

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
that as well so I'm going to also show
you<00:02:52.410> guys<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.340> happens<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.090> English

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
you guys what happens with the English

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.220 
you guys what happens with the English
gel<00:02:54.750> liner<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.050> 77<00:02:56.570> which<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> little<00:02:58.080> bit

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
gel liner in 77 which is a little bit

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.490 
gel liner in 77 which is a little bit
thinner<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.280> product<00:02:59.820> than<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.870> other<00:03:01.200> one

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
thinner of a product than the other one

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.200 
thinner of a product than the other one
I<00:03:03.170> say<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.950> little<00:03:05.460> bit<00:03:05.700> easier<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
I say that it's a little bit easier to

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.850 
I say that it's a little bit easier to
use<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.960> thinner<00:03:07.170> products<00:03:07.830> which<00:03:09.860> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
use with the thinner products which it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.250 
use with the thinner products which it
comes<00:03:11.490> out<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> little<00:03:12.000> bit<00:03:12.210> more<00:03:12.420> smooth<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
comes out a little bit more smooth and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.040 
comes out a little bit more smooth and
you<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> make<00:03:14.490> sure<00:03:14.520> you<00:03:14.850> roll<00:03:15.120> roll<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
you have to make sure you roll roll the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.190 
you have to make sure you roll roll the
silicone<00:03:16.500> brush<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.420> definitely<00:03:18.630> comes

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
silicone brush and it definitely comes

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.760 
silicone brush and it definitely comes
out<00:03:19.410> more<00:03:19.980> smooth<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.790> easier<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.600> use<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:22.260> you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
out more smooth and easier to use if you

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.710 
out more smooth and easier to use if you
use<00:03:22.950> more<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.400> thinner<00:03:23.670> consistency<00:03:23.940> gel

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
use more of a thinner consistency gel

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.050 
use more of a thinner consistency gel
liner<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:26.810> would<00:03:27.810> say<00:03:28.290> however<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.850> is

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
liner I would say however that this is

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.080 
liner I would say however that this is
not<00:03:30.300> my<00:03:30.330> favorite<00:03:31.080> application<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.910> gel

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
not my favorite application with the gel

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.030 
not my favorite application with the gel
liner<00:03:33.240> like<00:03:33.540> I've<00:03:33.780> much<00:03:34.260> rather<00:03:34.470> use<00:03:34.770> like<00:03:34.920> an

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
liner like I've much rather use like an

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.820 
liner like I've much rather use like an
angled<00:03:35.490> brush<00:03:35.640> or<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.080> Mac<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.710> like

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
angled brush or like a Mac you know like

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.630 
angled brush or like a Mac you know like
a<00:03:37.950> Mac<00:03:38.130> 266<00:03:38.520> or<00:03:39.860> like<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.890> fine<00:03:41.220> liner<00:03:41.520> brush

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
a Mac 266 or like a fine liner brush

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.050 
a Mac 266 or like a fine liner brush
then<00:03:42.300> using<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.020> silicone<00:03:43.560> brush<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.430> feel

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
then using this silicone brush I do feel

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.360 
then using this silicone brush I do feel
that<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.870> does<00:03:46.080> not<00:03:46.350> give<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.740> really<00:03:47.190> nice

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
that it does not give a really nice

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.390 
that it does not give a really nice
application<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.330> my<00:03:48.480> gel<00:03:48.720> liner<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:50.010> does

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
application of my gel liner like it does

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.730 
application of my gel liner like it does
leave<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.910> very<00:03:51.120> patchy<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.650> a

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
leave it very patchy I think it's a

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.890 
leave it very patchy I think it's a
great<00:03:53.070> idea<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.850> they<00:03:54.000> don't<00:03:54.240> want<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.690> to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
great idea that they don't want it to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.260 
great idea that they don't want it to
absorb<00:03:55.320> into<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.680> brush<00:03:56.040> however<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.030> think

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
absorb into the brush however I think

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.949 
absorb into the brush however I think
that<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.080> product<00:03:58.380> fell<00:03:58.800> flat<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.540> it<00:04:00.540> just

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
that this product fell flat and it just

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.480 
that this product fell flat and it just
winds<00:04:01.260> up<00:04:01.470> leaving<00:04:01.860> your<00:04:01.950> eyeline<00:04:02.340> are

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
winds up leaving your eyeline are

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.300 
winds up leaving your eyeline are
looking<00:04:02.820> really<00:04:03.030> patchy<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.500> would<00:04:05.190> go

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
looking really patchy so I would go

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.880 
looking really patchy so I would go
ahead<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.640> say<00:04:05.940> give<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.630> pass<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:07.410> not<00:04:07.650> go

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
ahead and say give this a pass do not go

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.040 
ahead and say give this a pass do not go
ahead<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.580> use<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.780> think

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
ahead and and use this I don't think

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.560 
ahead and and use this I don't think
this<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.230> really<00:04:10.740> worth<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.640> seven<00:04:12.270> dollars

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
this is really worth the seven dollars
