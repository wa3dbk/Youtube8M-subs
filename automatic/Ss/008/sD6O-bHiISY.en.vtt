00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
but kind of a slight bit of realism as

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.180 
but kind of a slight bit of realism as
well<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.690> being<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.230> wood<00:02:40.470> sign<00:02:40.830> beans

without a doubt so I think prison we got
quite<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.710> strong<00:02:44.130> side<00:02:44.520> compared<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.060> last

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
quite a strong side compared to last

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.750 
quite a strong side compared to last
year<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:46.560> got<00:02:46.680> young<00:02:46.980> players<00:02:47.340> as<00:02:47.580> well<00:02:47.610> a
