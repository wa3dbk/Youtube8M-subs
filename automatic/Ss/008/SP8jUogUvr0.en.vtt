the<00:00:49.399> first<00:00:49.609> thing<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.059> engineers<00:00:50.570> do<00:00:50.839> is<00:00:50.989> to

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
the first thing the engineers do is to

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.049 
the first thing the engineers do is to
glue<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.469> headset<00:00:51.949> inserts<00:00:52.460> into<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.730> top

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
glue the headset inserts into the top

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.670 
glue the headset inserts into the top
and<00:00:53.239> bottom<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.750> head<00:00:53.899> tube

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.100 

the<00:01:00.220> end<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.520> each<00:01:00.640> tube<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.510> lugs<00:01:01.750> are

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
the end of each tube and the lugs are

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.049 
the end of each tube and the lugs are
then<00:01:02.260> glued<00:01:02.440> into<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.100> put<00:01:03.250> into<00:01:03.430> place<00:01:03.640> one

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
then glued into and put into place one

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:18.190 
then glued into and put into place one
by<00:01:04.300> one

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
from triangle is assembled it is placed

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.179 
from triangle is assembled it is placed
onto<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.840> rig<00:01:21.170> where<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.470> technicians<00:01:22.040> can

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
onto the rig where the technicians can

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.800 
onto the rig where the technicians can
start<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.610> put<00:01:22.759> everything<00:01:23.060> into<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.479> correct

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
start to put everything into the correct

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.550 
start to put everything into the correct
position<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.850> glue<00:01:29.090> remains<00:01:29.479> pliable<00:01:30.080> so<00:01:30.439> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
position the glue remains pliable so the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.350 
position the glue remains pliable so the
