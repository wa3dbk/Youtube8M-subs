00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.190
 when I decided to leave the country if the santos board 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 but it was also clear that the experience is one 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.419
 the fact of working for a more prestigious company 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.249
 the price not only release 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.259
 inspiring 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.539
 although multinational team 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.019
 Nier must help others inspire others to have lives what they did but 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.100
 He said no 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 in the last years of age it would start at 0 to 2 the South Americans 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.320
 to make his revolutionary ideas come true 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.220
 immediately afterwards he would have confessed 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 so they can have reservists that will play in suspense 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 that was the way I had to support them from outside the country 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.280
 benitez 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.530
 today and returned to Peru because it is here where he wants to continue growing 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.250
 personally as a person and if applicable since April 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 counseling wit 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.770
 many times I have thought that it is elevated 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.970
 Jesus where some rubbing 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.250
 I think it has not been since then 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.990
 the fact that we are all different 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.620
 does diversity 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.910
 the vote of the motion 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.830
 and also team work 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 I think it's very important when you play and the consensus 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.330
 from the point of view of the best philosophy to make decisions is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.840
 do it by consensus 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.700
 not just reviewing without free use 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.100
 the probability of success is much higher 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.560
 when one listens 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.110
 with a final 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.719
 know how to listen at all levels of organization 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.880
 from the lowest 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 up to the highest 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 that reduces the possibility of plates 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.300
 our country is growing a lot 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 in that scenario 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 to enhance its development 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.990
 these ideas are what make us different 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.530
 depending on the 22 minutes that are registered from uruguay they arrived 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.310
 achieve a good national level
