00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome you are YouTube users I am 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.629
 there is a destination with another one of my videos 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I will make a comparison of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.980
 phones I was inspired by this kind of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 videos from the greg bone user who made a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.030
 video like the one I'm going to give but 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.400
 difference of him is that my video will put 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 as much as old telephones as 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.990
 modern phones good to start 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 we have the first phone that I had the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 sony ericsson z 310 a good phone 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.859
 musical and tapita with the little lights 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 that they kindled over like that of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.460
 messaging and so on was pretty 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 striking but what I did not like about 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.660
 this cell phone is that he was fucked 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 easily the flex because it was of cap 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.100
 the colors were of the least expected since 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 that the cell phone I chose my mother and not 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.450
 me because I was a boy in those times 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.489
 there was orange and pink I bought 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 the orange and it looked very ugly good in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.020
 end of this cell because it was damaged 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.910
 let's talk about the following Nokia 6300 a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 good phone and at that time was the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 phone with the best graphics for 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.480
 games and its design looked very attractive 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.280
 I loved this phone so much but 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 unfortunately I was robbed this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.790
 phone and they do not know how much it bothers me and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.630
 cried from the arrechera that he had 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.170
 after 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.360
 the Nokia 5220 a great music phone 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.219
 of the xpressmusic series with its keyboard 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.439
 multimedia that had it by the side 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.299
 left of the phone the bad thing is that 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.729
 when you have many games tucked in 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.799
 the phone when you listened to music 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 put the white screen on and the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.450
 phone after the phone is 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.490
 better I had the Nokia 63 a good 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.530
 phone apart my first phone with 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.390
 the qwerty keyboard and in its times was 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.090
 Fashionable having phones with keyboard 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.679
 qwerty but in my case with the Nokia 63 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 I also had a camera of 2 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.640
 megapixels with flash apart this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 phone was also my first 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.959
 smartphone because I could use the networks 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.209
 social etcetera etcetera the bad is 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.459
 that if you had many applications the 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.200
 phone reacted slowly from 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.000
 once in a while the screen worked 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 I had to remove the battery and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.189
 turn it on again good talking about 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.110
 smartphone I had the blackberry 8520 a 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.970
 good smartphone is simple and good since 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.890
 that I used to write with the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.630
 qwerty keyboard and had above a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 multimedia keyboard that to listen 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.220
 music was the indicated phone but what 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.870
 bad what is typical of blackberry always 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 it hurts him in something like him 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.340
 for the keyboard that if the software that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 If the screen does shine and 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.299
 I paid a lot of money on everything that 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.280
 it hurt the fucking fucking phone and the 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.560
 final I sold it to my dad because to him 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.450
 they also stole the good phone in 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.400
 if I buy it good when I wanted 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.319
 change my phone style 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.260
 I was interested in a tactile one and I bought the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.060
 blackberry 9530 simply one of the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.340
 worst choices I've had in 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.379
 first place the touch type of this 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.930
 cell trash was not the one that I 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.970
 wait I stepped on like a pretty button 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.799
 uncomfortable on the part of the blackberry by 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.079
 do this cellular shit was 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.060
 quite slow and tedious at the same time 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.640
 only thing that I rescue from this shit is the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.920
 3 2 megapixel camera with flash 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.049
 good quality and its quality of music that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.000
 It is regular quality but otherwise not 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.829
 please serve who was the imbecile that 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.810
 it occurred to him to create this garbage by 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.579
 please kill him and from there I did not want to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.829
 more than blackberry at that time when 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.690
 I sold that garbage I saved a little bit for 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.510
 buy me the sony ericsson xperia mini 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.760
 pro sk 17 a pretty good phone 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.819
 touch with a qwerty keyboard style 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 nokia n97 what I liked most about your system 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.870
 operative android 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.090
 and also its 5 megapixel camera that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.980
 record in hd and I do not forget its frontal 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 that for me it was innovative to use the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.610
 skype etcetera and their games that what 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.769
 downloaded by the google player to what 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.590
 maximum the bad is that of rom memory 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.510
 had 300 megabytes and when you had little 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.790
 memory prevented updates 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.769
 telling you low memory after what 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.599
 I sold by mercadolibre with the little 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.579
 money that I had I bought the samsung 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.519
 galaxy mini 2 a good phone with 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.439
 33-inch screen very good and the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.720
 sound quality was very good its 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.000
 internal memory of 4 gigs had 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.400
 enough space to install a lot 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.260
 of apps and games the bad of this 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.109
 cellular is your processor did not help it 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.940
 in nothing to be 800 megahertz do not you 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.040
 I ran all the games for example 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.959
 games that have a larger graphic already 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.760
 that those games like the lloyd pack 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.069
 wright and the need for speed undercover 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 for android run with processors 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.450
 double core onwards apart that this 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.699
 cell phone was stolen for bad luck and 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.500
 he also gave me so much arrechera then 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.019
 wait when my birthday was approaching 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.510
 my dad gave me a samsung galaxy s3 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.740
 I liked my phone but my dad 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.410
 they stole the phone 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.840
 to an iphone 5 when not that in Venezuela 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.240
 an offender does not steal a cell phone 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.190
 please deviate me from the good subject I gave him my 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.210
 phone and he thought so that I did not stay 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.190
 without a phone 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.490
 then I was struck by a 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.889
 phone it and optimus 3d max p720 that 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.479
 I was in the shop window 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.759
 then I bought it and then I thought because 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.770
 the son wrong pussy first of all the 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.199
 battery life was one of the worst 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.750
 I did not last anything the screen was 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.330
 low pixels what do you mean colors 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.729
 ugly the good was the camera the function 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.400
 3d and the processor after I sold it 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.919
 I bought the samsung galaxy s 1 and 9000 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.139
 pretty good super amoled what was 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.289
 more sensitive screen when sliding what 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.690
 bad gave you little user ram of 175 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.610
 megas therefore if I had facebook 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.949
 twitter and whatsapp was getting slow 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.020
 also the processor 1 gigahertz of a 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.449
 only nucleus did not help in the part 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.789
 of games your camera without little flash to me 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.210
 taste after I change it for a sony 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.250
 xperia 726 a striking phone and very 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.080
 good for its multimedia style since 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.400
 owns world man that by connecting the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.070
 headphones 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.259
 that puts the song another good point 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.509
 when we selected a theme I lit 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.130
 a little light on the bottom that 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.380
 matches the color of the theme that 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.630
 choose the pixel resolution is very 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.550
 good colors bad the processor 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.860
 a gigahertz because they are dyno put him 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.229
 another core that costs you for God 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.479
 Another bad point is that the touch keyboard 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.910
 of this phone is simply bad 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.729
 he reacted slowly when writing the 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.560
 camera with flash had no shit approach 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.080
 Then I changed it because it called me 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.630
 attention a phone against water is 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.550
 simply the samsung galaxy xcover a 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.710
 phone that is shockproof and 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.780
 Against the water weird and striking design 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.080
 the good thing is that it is against water and its 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.600
 3 2 megapixel camera now the bad 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.979
 This phone has little internal memory 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.199
 in case it prevented you from 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.970
 low RAM memory updates 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.160
 150 megs user 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.169
 I think the cover that covered 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.810
 to load it and also for the 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.389
 headphones quite uncomfortable also the 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.639
 resolution pixels few colors Ugly 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.110
 finally I change it for another phone that 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.580
 I wanted to try a new operating system 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.710
 windows phones 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.710
 to the attention so I change it for a 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.930
 nokia lumia 610 one of the most phones 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.000
 shit I 've had thinking it was 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.460
 good but I realized that it is a piece 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.800
 fucking because this phone has very 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.930
 few applications and games the most 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.849
 of them are to pay and I do not like that 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.490
 very much please another one in point against 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.650
 is the touch keyboard by god is one of 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.930
 the worst tactile keyboards that I've 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.090
 used because whenever you write you hit 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.250
 from one letter to the other when writing and 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.530
 erase reacted very slowly the 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.500
 keyboard the applications executed them 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.629
 very slowly since it has 256 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.460
 megabytes the applications some 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.740
 they had books for example the market 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.629
 free is in Portuguese and you change 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.969
 language to Spanish and did not react 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:26.370
 apart you put the option questions that 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.440
 I did not react another point 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.779
 terrible thing about this damn phone is that 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.669
 to put songs and videos images 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:35.279
 you have to have the application on your pc 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:37.050
 called zune by god is quite the 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:39.599
 goodbye or pass songs from a 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.669
 program I do not understand nokia with this and 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.319
 after joining with windows phones 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.660
 it was the worst since that system 

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.400
 operative in my opinion is the 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.100
 my heir because instead of updating 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.200
 the applications do not leave it that way 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.900
 shit and comments from users 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.210
 they do not care, good friends, those are the 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.250
 phones that I have currently I follow 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.650
 using that shit but my dad is going to 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:05.540
 buy another good phone we'll see you in 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.540
