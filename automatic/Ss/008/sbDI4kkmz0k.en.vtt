00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.490
 in Argentine soccer today 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.200
 so much prominence of the archer in some 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.950
 social moment book in team the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.090
 goalkeeper 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.090
 can be 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.280
 delta is like the axis always of this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.220
 game system I feel comfortable 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.890
 because I like it 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.140
 out there sometimes risking a little bit 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.419
 more or a little less I have defenders 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 that they also ask me to play 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.020
 down 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.270
 always try always 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.220
 have I do not know how to have the ball take care of it 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.530
 revoke it because we do not have 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.540
 we have people up there who can stand 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.450
 or that is 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.580
 this in the position for that we would have 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.900
 had I do not know maybe a player 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.820
 big guy that holds the ball with the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.650
 same pattern because the people that the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.230
 bust and the tata wants me to play 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:11.650
 I say it's difficult, yes, but I obey the 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.890
 interest the technician this after 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.210
 good people that is the framework that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.730
 there sometimes he gives 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.460
 the importance to a party 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.800
 adds or subtracts pressure against volvo and the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.680
 you felt yes 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.680
 and after that by the error of 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.390
 but the biggest mistake millions has 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.460
 played to be penal that the replays 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.409
 if I put you right to the arch because I had 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.729
 three players of yours I said like that 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.310
 better I'm wrong contains for 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.380
 correct me it has not been easier for me 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.450
 I would have stayed maybe faced hand to 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.909
 hand and he collided with the defender gives a 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.930
 step back and defining that is the other 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.520
 choice 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.890
 I think 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.829
 obviously they are issues of deciding on 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.159
 seconds but if maybe there 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.509
 preferred that and then watching the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.879
 Repeat accompany me good out there 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.090
 I think the play also took me to 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.160
 that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.530
 just as I have to for that felt 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.200
 after that play 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.030
 in an uncomfortable situation that that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.290
 discomfort suffered the technician what 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.470
 he said at a press conference martÃ­n 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.760
 the whistles went out to bank you 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 whistles even more bothered me 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.519
 previous outside it looks different me in 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.110
 I have the possibility to download between 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.580
 quotes if you want a way you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.860
 the ball comes again and he has to 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.769
 keep playing or after that 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.870
 I had to keep playing with the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.200
 feet that are cut out the center have the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.790
 feeling to say thank you thank you for 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.480
 trust me call me is for 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.409
 fulfill him 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.069
 there are many technicians and young people and it is not 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.019
 cute is a nice feeling sometimes my 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.690
 old woman who is the one who most marks me 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.549
 you realize and you realize in the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.900
 team that is playing and sometimes one 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:13.709
 within all the move and this this 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.019
 this does not take you sometimes I wish good 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.760
 maybe you do not fall for what they are going with you 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.590
 technicians with a career in the club 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.569
 and in national teams 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.909
 awesome you are surrounded by 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.540
 international players first 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:31.670
 quality and sometimes it makes me fall a bit 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.670
 make the chip fall a little more 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.200
 and sincerely the tata 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.720
 I get the feeling and it seems to me because 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.240
 we have had to share some one 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.510
 talk of a guy to talk a little 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.700
 beyond football is also 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.350
 very clear in football concepts is 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.970
 very clear when he talks when a talk 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:58.340
 then out there it 's better to try 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.010
 enter the group theme as it is 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.280
 each one of the guys as how do I 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.980
 go 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.850
 it seems to me a kind of one of a quality 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.790
 of person 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.799
 10 points I did not have the possibility of 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.729
 I do not know about sharing a barbecue and talking 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.109
 other things but it shows it shows with 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.389
 a 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.840
 after your football career and 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.259
 obviously make the click to be 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.819
 sitting almost 34 years in the bank and a 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.840
 moment for another to have the possibility of 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:38.020
 play on a team like that there is a click and 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.180
 obviously 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.300
 I do not want to waste it then 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.379
 We will do everything possible to bank the 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.969
 moment to defend the one who gave me the 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.329
 possibility and for 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:56.599
 to meet the expectations of 

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:57.709

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.469
