faith-based films you may be asking the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.630 
faith-based films you may be asking the
question<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> well<00:00:31.740> done<00:00:32.009> movie

well<00:00:32.960> kinda<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:34.559> talk<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
well kinda but let's talk about the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
well kinda but let's talk about the
message<00:00:35.280> first<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:35.940> liked<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.780> message

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
message first I really liked the message

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470 
message first I really liked the message
in<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.210> something

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
in this one I think that's something

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
in this one I think that's something
really<00:00:39.629> worth<00:00:40.079> exploring<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.710> idea<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
really worth exploring this idea of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
really worth exploring this idea of
faith<00:00:41.820> doesn't<00:00:42.120> make<00:00:42.600> something<00:00:43.110> happen<00:00:43.290> it's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
faith doesn't make something happen it's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.330 
faith doesn't make something happen it's
not<00:00:43.800> necessarily<00:00:44.550> true<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.410> does<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.920> faith

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
not necessarily true or does it is faith

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.880 
not necessarily true or does it is faith
like<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.850> magic<00:00:48.329> trick<00:00:48.360> where<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.350> because

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
like a magic trick where you can because

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.560 
like a magic trick where you can because
you<00:00:50.039> believe<00:00:50.399> something<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> make

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you believe something is going to make

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.139 
you believe something is going to make
it<00:00:51.719> happen<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.379> loved<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.699> movie

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it happen and I loved how this movie

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
it happen and I loved how this movie
took<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.079> explore<00:00:55.500> both<00:00:55.860> sides<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
took the time to explore both sides of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
took the time to explore both sides of
that<00:00:56.699> equation<00:00:56.840> from<00:00:57.840> somebody<00:00:58.289> who<00:00:58.500> has

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
that equation from somebody who has

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
that equation from somebody who has
faith<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.399> higher<00:00:59.430> power<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.059> make<00:01:00.510> things

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
faith in a higher power to make things

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
faith in a higher power to make things
happen<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.289> pray<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.190> want

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
happen as they pray for them and want

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.729 
happen as they pray for them and want
them<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> happen<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.840> people<00:01:04.350> who<00:01:04.710> don't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
them to happen and as people who don't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.219 
them to happen and as people who don't
believe<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> higher<00:01:05.549> power<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> as

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
believe in a higher power and see it as

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.590 
believe in a higher power and see it as
an<00:01:07.320> imaginary<00:01:07.590> friend<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> sky<00:01:08.670> who<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
an imaginary friend in the sky who you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240 
an imaginary friend in the sky who you
know<00:01:09.720> can't<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.260> things<00:01:10.470> happen<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> like

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
know can't make things happen and I like

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.440 
know can't make things happen and I like
that<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> movie<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.820> able<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that the movie was able to kind of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.289 
that the movie was able to kind of
explore<00:01:12.740> both<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.040> those<00:01:14.189> avenues<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
explore both of those avenues in this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.320 
explore both of those avenues in this
one<00:01:15.600> film<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:17.040> say<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.909> much<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
one film I will say that as much as I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
one film I will say that as much as I
loved<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.990> message<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.619> did<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
loved the message it did get a little

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
loved the message it did get a little
bit<00:01:20.430> muddled<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:22.049> there's<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> lot

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
bit muddled for me because there's a lot

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
bit muddled for me because there's a lot
of<00:01:22.770> messages<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> doesn't<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.210> stop<00:01:24.540> at

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
of messages here it doesn't just stop at

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.560 
of messages here it doesn't just stop at
this<00:01:24.930> message<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.500> faith<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.570> belief

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
this message about faith and and belief

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.590 
this message about faith and and belief
it<00:01:28.290> moves<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> messages<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.000> tolerance

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it moves on to messages about tolerance

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.480 
it moves on to messages about tolerance
a<00:01:30.780> lot<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.290> movie<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> fact

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
a lot of this movie is about the fact

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
a lot of this movie is about the fact
that<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.790> world<00:01:32.970> war<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> there's<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that it's world war two and there's a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
that it's world war two and there's a
Japanese<00:01:34.409> man<00:01:34.950> living<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> city<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Japanese man living in this city and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.990 
Japanese man living in this city and
that<00:01:37.020> itself<00:01:37.439> seems<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> worthy<00:01:38.340> thing<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that itself seems like a worthy thing to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
that itself seems like a worthy thing to
explore<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.259> necessarily<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
explore but it's not necessarily on the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
explore but it's not necessarily on the
same<00:01:41.640> page<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.899> deep<00:01:43.200> issue<00:01:43.409> were

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
same page as this other deep issue were

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560 
same page as this other deep issue were
exploring<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.700> there's<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.060> element<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
exploring then there's this element of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
exploring then there's this element of
bullying<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.590> kid<00:01:46.860> being<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
bullying about this kid being little and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
bullying about this kid being little and
being<00:01:47.850> picked<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.509> school<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> how

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
being picked on at school and and how

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.600 
being picked on at school and and how
his<00:01:50.399> friends<00:01:51.350> friends<00:01:52.350> treat<00:01:52.860> him<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.369> those

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
his friends friends treat him in those

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.910 
his friends friends treat him in those
kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.939> things<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.930> there's<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> element

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
kind of things so there's that element

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.889 
kind of things so there's that element
of<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> which<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.909> could<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.450> together<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
of it to which that could go together I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
of it to which that could go together I
guess<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> tolerance<00:01:58.710> issue<00:01:59.280> but<00:01:59.850> again

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
guess with the tolerance issue but again

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
guess with the tolerance issue but again
the<00:02:00.119> faith<00:02:00.360> issue<00:02:00.600> seems<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.350> other

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the faith issue seems like this other

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.709 
the faith issue seems like this other
bigger<00:02:01.829> issue<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.509> then

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
bigger issue that's out there and then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.170 
bigger issue that's out there and then

interweaving them it felt like a whole
bunch<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.670> different<00:02:24.819> sermons<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:26.109> weren't

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
really tied together well if that makes

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.720 
really tied together well if that makes
a<00:02:28.450> lot<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.659> sense<00:02:28.959> plus<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.859> fact<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.430> lot

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
a lot of sense plus the fact that a lot

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.459 
a lot of sense plus the fact that a lot
of<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.939> really<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.239> preachy<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.200> don't<00:02:32.349> like

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
of it really is preachy and I don't like

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.649 
of it really is preachy and I don't like
that<00:02:32.739> you've<00:02:33.219> got<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.459> trust<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.180> audience

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
that you've got to trust the audience

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.970 
that you've got to trust the audience
and<00:02:35.019> that's<00:02:35.079> probably<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.469> worst<00:02:35.590> thing<00:02:35.950> for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and that's probably the worst thing for

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.410 
and that's probably the worst thing for
me<00:02:36.189> is<00:02:36.430> they<00:02:36.579> don't<00:02:36.639> have<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.879> faith<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
me is they don't have that faith in the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.270

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
one those emotional moments are nice and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.749 
one those emotional moments are nice and
they're<00:03:25.900> powerful<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.979> they<00:03:27.159> don't<00:03:27.430> fit<00:03:27.729> the

for a Tim Burton heightened reality kind
of<00:03:33.759> thing<00:03:33.970> well<00:03:34.389> that's<00:03:34.509> fine<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.900> want<00:03:35.139> to

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229 
of thing well that's fine if you want to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.050 
of thing well that's fine if you want to
do<00:03:35.349> that<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.650> can<00:03:35.799> still<00:03:36.040> have<00:03:36.159> a<00:03:36.220> message<00:03:36.639> and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
do that you can still have a message and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.659 
do that you can still have a message and
still<00:03:37.269> have<00:03:37.419> emotion<00:03:37.989> but<00:03:38.979> the<00:03:39.129> way<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.310> paint

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
still have emotion but the way you paint

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.640 
still have emotion but the way you paint
that<00:03:39.759> emotion<00:03:40.269> has<00:03:40.449> to<00:03:40.659> live<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.079> quirky

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
that emotion has to live in that quirky

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.740 
that emotion has to live in that quirky
world<00:03:41.919> in<00:03:42.310> here<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.150> way<00:03:43.239> they<00:03:43.389> paint<00:03:43.629> that

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
world in here the way they paint that

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.330 
world in here the way they paint that
emotion<00:03:44.109> almost<00:03:44.379> goes<00:03:44.560> into<00:03:44.889> a<00:03:44.919> different

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
emotion almost goes into a different

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.270 
emotion almost goes into a different
type<00:03:45.579> of<00:03:45.870> melodrama<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.739> doesn't<00:03:48.069> fit

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
type of melodrama and so it doesn't fit

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.110 
type of melodrama and so it doesn't fit
together<00:03:48.639> very<00:03:48.909> well

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
together very well

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.149 
together very well
feels<00:03:49.359> unbalanced<00:03:50.109> in<00:03:50.259> that<00:03:50.470> way<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:51.009> I

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
feels unbalanced in that way and that I

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.640 
feels unbalanced in that way and that I
think<00:03:51.370> diminishes<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.000> end<00:03:52.120> product<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:52.720> well

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
think diminishes the end product as well

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.439 
think diminishes the end product as well
overall<00:03:54.189> little<00:03:54.489> boy<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.609> think<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> fine

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
overall little boy I think is a fine

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.300 
overall little boy I think is a fine
enough<00:03:55.689> movie<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.319> will<00:03:56.409> certainly<00:03:56.889> appeal

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
enough movie and will certainly appeal

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.949 
enough movie and will certainly appeal
to<00:03:57.579> people<00:03:57.969> of<00:03:58.060> faith<00:03:58.120> because<00:03:58.629> of<00:03:58.659> what<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
to people of faith because of what it

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.740 
to people of faith because of what it
says<00:03:59.229> about<00:03:59.259> faith<00:04:00.129> but<00:04:00.819> because<00:04:01.389> of<00:04:01.419> some<00:04:01.719> of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
says about faith but because of some of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.809 
says about faith but because of some of
the<00:04:01.870> sermonizing<00:04:02.379> and<00:04:02.919> all<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.669> different

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the sermonizing and all the different

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.849 
the sermonizing and all the different
messages<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.719> inconsistency<00:04:05.469> in<00:04:05.590> tone

it's<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.609> too<00:04:06.759> inconsistent<00:04:07.030> for<00:04:07.479> me<00:04:07.569> to

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:07.719 
it's just too inconsistent for me to

it's just too inconsistent for me to
really<00:04:07.870> give<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.409> anything<00:04:08.799> more<00:04:08.979> than<00:04:09.129> like<00:04:09.280> a
