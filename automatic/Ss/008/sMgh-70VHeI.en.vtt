00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.869
 the termini station is frequented by one 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.000
 series of subjects who take advantage 

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:13.180
 of the naivety of some travelers who 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.800
 mostly tourists also offer 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.429
 a series of services in the manner of 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.859
 all unauthorized and abusive is spoken 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:25.319
 of abusive porters 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.880
 drinks and other subjects instead 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.499
 worry about helping travelers in the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.950
 make the ticket to the machines 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.350
 automatic asking insistently 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.960
 an economic remuneration we must 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.150
 imagine that the termini station is one 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.110
 city ​​within a city ​​point e 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.930
 From Rome 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.940
 on average they travel every day 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.400
 within the sanction about 500,000 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.830
 people over a year ago started 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.870
 a campaign in collaboration with the 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.670
 railway police a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.650
 raise awareness of the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.480
 travelers towards these 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.460
 unlawful conduct 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.130
 we have therefore prepared a series of 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.809
 notice boards that 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.270
 they try to attract attention 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.770
 of the traveler and therefore to put it in 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.650
 guard against these 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.560
 illicit behavior and we therefore 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.540
 realized a project that foresees the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.030
 delimitation of the station in two 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.550
 large areas therefore the station will come 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.920
 conceptually separate there will be one 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.630
 purely commercial part where 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.150
 will be present all the services of 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.270
 station and a part purely 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.630
 railway dedicated to users where 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 it will be possible to access only equipped 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.070
 of ticket the project will see the light 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.259
 by the summer of this year 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.330
 at the moment we are experimenting with 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.009
 of mobile barriers the management of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.650
 flows foreseen precisely by this 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.690
 project that does not consist of a 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.610
 turnstile system but with gates that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.869
 precisely they will be attended by staff 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 railway 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.380
 we have created islands inside 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.240
 of the self-service machines of the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.490
 station terms that are precisely 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.440
 attended by railway personnel 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.530
 just to prevent these subjects 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.690
 unauthorized to approach the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.090
 travelers and help make tickets 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.860
 all obviously with the help of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.110
 railway police which is ours 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.540
 first ally in countering these 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.920
 illicit phenomena to which we ourselves 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.819
 we rely on the moment we take over 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.819
 of the critical points
