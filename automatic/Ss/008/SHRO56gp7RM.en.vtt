00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 tomorrow opens the week of bread in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.500
 France ensured his daily bread 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.269
 the expression shows that bread 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 was the basis of food 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.630
 French 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.670
 since the middle ages and perhaps before 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.330
 the first breads made 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.650
 in antiquity 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.359
 several thousand years before 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 jesus christ in the sixties 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.080
 ten after the shortage of the second 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.000
 world war diets and the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 mediocre quality of some breads had 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 rather favored the arrival of the rusk 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 today the good bread has again the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.830
 side and tradition comes back at a gallop 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.830
 claudine gilbert michel levasseur 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.530
 find the true taste of bread it would be 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 more than a fashion 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.649
 a return to the roots France counts 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 more than 80 regional with its pretty 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.940
 golden loaf tasty and they get 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.780
 keep a long time the French reconnect 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.340
 with their story 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.629
 it's an American who reads you I'm 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 never stopped for our purposes and disgusting 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.050
 I showed me not first because the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 bridge was at the heart of the concerns 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.510
 from France 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.210
 we talk a lot about security 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.490
 today the step was security 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.200
 in time when we were in a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.780
 permanent deprivation environment 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.189
 whose boyfriend was the key to power the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.350
 king effect the baker of the last 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.360
 resort the whole French system 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 political and social was based on the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320
 belly and we learn by the withdrawal 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.500
 the god because we think 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.210
 sacred clary man coincides the story of the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.170
 bread are made in the history of 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.360
 civilizations 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.450
 it begins in the Neolithic there is more 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.910
 from 8000 years from the 15th to the xth century before 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.190
 our era the Egyptians invents more 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.759
 of 40 kinds on dates with figs and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.200
 honey for the pleasure of the pharaohs 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.940
 the worsened Roman treats him the crowds 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 with bread and games 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.490
 in the eighteenth century mechanization allowed 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 to improve the quality of bread the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.920
 peasants consume up to 2 pounds 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.680
 per day 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.289
 it will remain the basis of food 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.380
 until 1950 the complexion then becomes 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.720
 whiter the less good in the heart of the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.530
 planning is the mastery of the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.020
 fermentation 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.619
 gold from the end of the nineteenth war 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.630
 World 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.810
 we almost eliminated the first 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.790
 fermenting public pointing to do 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.200
 a step that was hyper white a little 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.790
 Laundry detergent 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 finally leave 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.659
 it was done in the ease of 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.780
 mechanization the return to the first 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.230
 change to the score during the turn to 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.590
 Olfactory and taste paradise and that's it 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.040
 if you want the tradition for 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.930
 knowingly it's the taste today the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.180
 French still walk on the baton 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.189
 we buy more than 10 billion a year 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.799
 but special breads multiply 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:47.750
 be careful only the traditional bread 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.879
 French is guaranteed without additives then 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.920
 bread makes you fat that's the 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.450
 question and then also what are the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.200
 virtues response from a doctor 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.200
 nutritionist 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.210
 absolutely no bread does 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.250
 absolutely not exaggerated on the contrary it is 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.110
 shame we hear that said so it holds 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.510
 certainly uncertain the doctor me 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.240
 to grasp in quotation marks or who 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.130
 bloom everywhere that make diets 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.060
 said those who have removed the step of 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.800
 many diets 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.330
 so it's absolutely wrong 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.270
 to consume the painter how much 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.710
 good a subject a male subject can 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.170
 consume about 2000 of 1200 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.370
 calories a day and a woman with breasts 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.680
 autonomy of 600 thousand seven hundred which 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.390
 gives you the right to consume a half 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.890
 baguette three quarters or a 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.790
 baguette depending on if you are a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.250
 force worker 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.390
 so there is something to eat sandwiches 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.680
 have their place then someone who has 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.150
 no time to eat lunch so 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.100
 balanced more quite eat a 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.330
 sandwich by doing it maybe doing 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.860
 because you have to control and maybe 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.210
 in some sandwich shops they are 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.320
 about are already ready and 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.800
 unfortunately they are filled with 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.990
 fat 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.790
 so avoid the Greek sandwich by 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.080
 example that is enough that enriches with 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.010
 fries things like that it's not 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.630
 a good composition 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.180
 we should rather take the sandwich 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.040
 classic ham with a little butter 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.930
 control and butter because there one 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.100
 done is the limit in a cafe 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.700
 you enter a brewery where the 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.700
 doing at the counter
