isn't<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.620> active<00:02:52.980> today<00:02:53.150> well<00:02:54.150> let<00:02:54.270> me<00:02:54.390> try<00:02:54.510> to

isn't it active today well let me try to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.890 
isn't it active today well let me try to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
it were to occur in her today it would

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.760 
it were to occur in her today it would
