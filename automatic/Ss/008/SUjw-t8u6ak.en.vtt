is<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.590> real<00:02:03.770> under<00:02:04.100> sensor<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> next<00:02:05.330> job

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
is the real under sensor so the next job

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.430 
is the real under sensor so the next job
is<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.690> whip<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.259> out<00:02:06.350> I'm<00:02:06.649> putting<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.039> on<00:02:07.070> it

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440

she'll just shoes and on this card is

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.050 
she'll just shoes and on this card is
only<00:02:11.959> one<00:02:12.200> bunk<00:02:12.500> because<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.890> only<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.250> single

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
only one bunk because it's only a single

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.270 
only one bunk because it's only a single
side<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.720> it's<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.050> lambda<00:02:15.560> sentences<00:02:16.130> the

again<00:02:24.170> new<00:02:24.320> era<00:02:24.590> cords<00:02:25.070> on<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:26.090> when<00:02:26.570> I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
again new era cords on that one when I

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.880 
again new era cords on that one when I
open<00:02:26.930> comes<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:28.239> its<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.510> downstream<00:02:30.080> which

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
open comes with its the downstream which

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:41.259 
open comes with its the downstream which
is<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.810> car<00:02:39.110> jacked<00:02:39.470> up<00:02:39.620> enormous<00:02:39.860> stuns<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
is the car jacked up enormous stuns and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.190 
is the car jacked up enormous stuns and
I've<00:02:41.480> got<00:02:41.660> them

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
I've got them

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.330 
I've got them
clear<00:02:42.470> off<00:02:42.680> underneath<00:02:43.360> let's<00:02:44.360> see<00:02:44.600> where

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.210 

okay<00:02:51.110> see<00:02:52.110> that's<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:53.240> old<00:02:54.240> valve<00:02:54.950> old<00:02:55.950> ass

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
okay see that's the old valve old ass

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.250 
okay see that's the old valve old ass
and<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.850> since<00:02:57.060> I'm<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> trace

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and so since I'm going to trace

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.070 
and so since I'm going to trace
that<00:02:58.500> wire<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:59.040> long<00:03:01.310> way<00:03:02.310> there<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.970> I'm<00:03:03.900> going

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
that wire a long way there and I'm going

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.210 
that wire a long way there and I'm going
to<00:03:04.110> disconnect<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:09.470> it's<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.590> just<00:03:10.650> unclip

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
to disconnect it it's not just unclip

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.510 
to disconnect it it's not just unclip
them<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.720> end<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.020> way<00:03:13.140> up<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:14.400> this

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
them the end of the way up and this

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.390 
them the end of the way up and this
looks<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.940> fairly<00:03:15.270> straightforward<00:03:15.450> job

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
looks like a fairly straightforward job

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.220 
looks like a fairly straightforward job
unscrew<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.430> screwing<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> want<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.510> jobs

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
unscrew that screwing you want in jobs

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.140 
unscrew that screwing you want in jobs
are<00:03:19.350> good<00:03:19.470> however<00:03:20.040> I'm<00:03:20.400> expecting<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.000> to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
are good however I'm expecting this to

let's go get it off pantry would give it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.670 
let's go get it off pantry would give it
a<00:03:42.720> second<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.319> enough<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.830> get<00:03:43.980> me<00:03:44.069> spotless
