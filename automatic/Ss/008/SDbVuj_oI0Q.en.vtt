down<00:00:15.420> I'll<00:00:16.230> tell<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.580> thing<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
down I'll tell you the first thing to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.300 
down I'll tell you the first thing to
know<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.560> put<00:00:19.710> down<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:20.189> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
know is what not to put down because it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790 
know is what not to put down because it
will<00:00:20.369> jam<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.270> well<00:00:21.960> eggshells<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
will jam it up and it's well eggshells I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
will jam it up and it's well eggshells I
grew<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.189> thinking<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.730> eggshells<00:00:24.390> helped

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
grew up thinking that eggshells helped

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
grew up thinking that eggshells helped
sharpen<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> blades<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.949> should<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.490> put

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
sharpen the blades and should be put

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.759 
sharpen the blades and should be put
down<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.050> true<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
down this is so not true because the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.519 
down this is so not true because the
membrane<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.789> gum<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> cause<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> lot

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
membrane can gum it up and cause a lot

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
membrane can gum it up and cause a lot
of<00:00:31.619> problems<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.189> blades<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> then

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of problems with your blades and then

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.150 
of problems with your blades and then
the<00:00:33.239> shell<00:00:33.540> itself<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.260> turn<00:00:34.440> into<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.710> sand

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the shell itself can turn into a sand

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060 
the shell itself can turn into a sand
that<00:00:35.520> gets<00:00:35.579> trapped<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.840> trap<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that gets trapped in the trap so you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.410 
that gets trapped in the trap so you
don't<00:00:38.340> want<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.579> put<00:00:38.730> eggs<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:39.180> their

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420

eggshells anyway you don't also want to
put<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.170> any<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.950> fibrous<00:00:44.550> vegetables
