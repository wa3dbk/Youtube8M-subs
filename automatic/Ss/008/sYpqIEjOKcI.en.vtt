00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.870
 is she the one I show details there 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 how to adjust is the control current of the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.929
 suzuki intruder 125 is first 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.779
 This front cover 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:28.590
 access to the main axis of the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:32.449
 black then go to that screw and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.449
 which is actually a cover that gives access 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.570
 grandmother 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 the disk view that the markup 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:49.309
 the top dead center ms-135 there with 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.670
 aid of a flashlight that goes round 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.820
 rotating when aligned with the pointer 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.840
 which is in the upper housing and then this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.720
 That's where it must be to stop for 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.439
 release the adjusting nut and bolt 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.450
 the adjustment automatically does if what 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.450
 Do you think they did not have the flu? 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.539
 I 'm already arriving on the point it 's on the point. 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:35.100
 Okay, I got it but now I'm going to release it. 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:43.369
 in the adjusting screw of the door is 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.369
 art or having difficulty having 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:02:00.479
 I managed to get through difficulties 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.189
 camera is positioned 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.130
 Now I'll show you a simulation there. 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.599
 showing clockwise 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.190
 it is closing the door according to the screw 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:16.170
 It's just a simulation that I could not 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.930
 now counterclockwise 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.799
 tightening and tightening is the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.639
 adjustment to the previously tight is not 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:31.709
 is that of the positive result with the 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:35.160
 noise reduction of auto symptoms 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.740
 adjustment is you note soon the difference 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.380
 I'll show you the noise now. 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:48.820
 the motorcycle after adjustment and in the 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.210
 sequence is to see how the noise was 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.690
 very large again in the sequence 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.460
 Show 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.460
 I hope it will be useful for other people 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.820
 there adjust your clash sum too much 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.820
 thank you
