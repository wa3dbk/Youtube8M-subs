00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 round 15 player rating projections yes 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.639
 today again a few players in 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.929
 called the last episode quite often 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.330
 were in comments at least on 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 most often have repeated and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.949
 that's why it does not live today 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 small mix from bundesliga league bbva and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.689
 So the premier league is out this time 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 no real schematic again goes here 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.539
 not only for change but also in the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.250
 players who remained there but a few 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 That's why yes, yes 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.230
 nice colorful mixed round this time 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.320
 I think we'll start first 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 valentine stocker of listening so far 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.829
 would like to lie about that for relative 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.170
 big money i have 45 million like that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 that andrÃ© so relatively big for 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.879
 Relationships of a straight riser 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.610
 the penultimate season is definitely 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.829
 already neat and that should not 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.469
 very likely a new candidate 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.820
 these three teams will be the bundesliga 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.579
 definitely has a very great deal for that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.430
 strong map for the left midfield 380 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.140
 pace 50 78 dribbling about as 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.449
 said this time the stats are back on 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 from head to head about than how the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.130
 currently headset would be the next 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 alexandrow maxime also a good one 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.750
 played together really strong 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 rhine starts at the end a bit declined 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.259
 not used that often anymore 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 and unfortunately we will be with it or me 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.890
 at least my favorite scene in the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.920
 lose silver range from this year 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 but the other other positive is it 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 could be that alexander 19 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.790
 next five stars gets ski moves 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.329
 according to the current update had on 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.860
 every case 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.200
 and then of course a pretty small one 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.540
 option for the bundesliga as 10 of the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 next lhasa markovic where i unfortunately 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 even by hearsay can say that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.060
 he rather called a self- fair yes 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.729
 is not called messi over david days 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.850
 As a young player I like a yes 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.979
 Serbian fair for relatively much money too 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.110
 liverpool changed exit home 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.490
 In any case, a card is drawn 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.320
 we are probably different 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.820
 times in the premier league teams next 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.479
 shall find song on the right 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.149
 side alone because of the pace of the next 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.289
 is a bit more controversial at least 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.110
 view of the fans of hamburger sv is yes 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.959
 no charlan euro 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.459
 you want that is also for 14 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.380
 millions or something to leverkusen 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.200
 changed long back and forth on each 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000
 case has powerful updates in doing it plus 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.100
 17 chf +9 fit 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.660
 In addition , the card has grown 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.230
 probably five places advised four 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.570
 stars 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.459
 that could be pretty cool you can 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.290
 of course , hope that ecm is but 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 probably rather left midfield 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.730
 the last card is gareth bale and the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.050
 Everybody should see each other in the next summer 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.940
 fall on the right wing again 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.250
 because he is there, so to speak, yes the complete 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 season has played 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.950
 that's why it's not the beautiful one anymore 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.330
 possibility in storm or defensive 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.519
 to let midfield play out there 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.680
 nothing so season that features that 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.510
 You can see them by changing 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.070
 stats are likely to remain quite similar 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.600
 I have speed and finish again 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.190
 set high for the fanning bit 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.170
 So down quite similar may be 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.570
 and so again a very expensive card 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.489
 Next year will be even then 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.830
 Got what you think about what 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.540
 i have fabricated here at the sets ob 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.340
 who agree or not 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.870
 and otherwise, of course, call again 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.510
 few players that you see it again 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.519
 I wanted to again my opinion too 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.989
 want to hear and otherwise proven 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.519
 who do not forget now have 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.709
 I watch the next video and then 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.709
 until then , schulz wanted
