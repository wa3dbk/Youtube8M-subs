the<00:06:02.080> tactics<00:06:02.530> like<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.520> did<00:06:03.759> a<00:06:03.789> few<00:06:04.060> times<00:06:04.979> is<00:06:05.979> a

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
the tactics like I did a few times is a

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.930 
the tactics like I did a few times is a
sped<00:06:06.400> up<00:06:06.580> by<00:06:06.729> the<00:06:06.789> way<00:06:06.970> so<00:06:08.370> that's<00:06:09.370> why<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:09.849> so

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
sped up by the way so that's why it's so

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.080 
sped up by the way so that's why it's so
fast<00:06:10.479> I<00:06:10.830> don't<00:06:11.830> think<00:06:12.039> any<00:06:12.159> one<00:06:12.280> want<00:06:12.580> one<00:06:12.849> want

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
fast I don't think any one want one want

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.399 
fast I don't think any one want one want
to<00:06:13.810> see<00:06:14.050> a<00:06:14.080> normal<00:06:14.680> video<00:06:19.020> from<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.139> office

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
to see a normal video from the office

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:27.210 
to see a normal video from the office
without<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.550> being<00:06:21.699> sped<00:06:22.090> up<00:06:22.240> so<00:06:24.330> I<00:06:26.099> recorded<00:06:27.099> a

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
without it being sped up so I recorded a

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.219 
without it being sped up so I recorded a
system<00:06:27.610> audio<00:06:27.789> like<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.509> game<00:06:28.719> audio<00:06:29.080> and
