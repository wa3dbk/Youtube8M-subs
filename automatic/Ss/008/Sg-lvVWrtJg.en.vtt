pressure cooker risotto and since there

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
pressure cooker risotto and since there
is<00:00:22.410> no<00:00:22.619> evaporation<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> pressure<00:00:23.880> cooker

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
is no evaporation in the pressure cooker

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.230 
is no evaporation in the pressure cooker
the<00:00:24.570> ratios<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.859> grain<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.490> liquid<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the ratios of the grain to liquid the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.019 
the ratios of the grain to liquid the
rice<00:00:27.599> bring<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.619> stop<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.580> really

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
rice bring to a stop are really

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.389 
rice bring to a stop are really
important<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:31.880> unveil<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.059> eyes<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:34.399> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
important for unveil your eyes the the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.260 
important for unveil your eyes the the
ratio<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.559> one<00:00:37.559> cup<00:00:37.920> rise<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.489> two<00:00:38.670> cups<00:00:38.910> stock

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
ratio is one cup rise to two cups stock

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
ratio is one cup rise to two cups stock
and<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.899> will<00:00:40.020> always<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.590> perfect<00:00:41.129> result

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and you will always get perfect result

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.529 
and you will always get perfect result
and<00:00:42.980> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> measuring<00:00:44.969> cup<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and if you don't have a measuring cup it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.529 
and if you don't have a measuring cup it
could<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.840> -<00:00:46.260> uh<00:00:46.530> -<00:00:47.280> anything<00:00:47.760> -<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.120> anything

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
could be - uh - anything - want anything

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.779 
could be - uh - anything - want anything
so<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.800> month<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.160> rice<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:51.149> months<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> stock

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
so one month of rice two months of stock

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
so one month of rice two months of stock
one<00:00:53.789> glass<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.239> rice<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:55.140> glass<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.410> stock<00:00:55.829> as

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
one glass of rice one glass of stock as

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
one glass of rice one glass of stock as
long<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> stick<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.329> ratio<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.960> will

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
long as you stick to this ratio it will

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.880 
long as you stick to this ratio it will
come<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.440> perfect<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:01.410> actually<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
come out perfect so I'm actually a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
come out perfect so I'm actually a
measuring<00:01:02.520> cup<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.120> over<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> fuse

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
measuring cup so that's over the fuse

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.300 
measuring cup so that's over the fuse
and<00:01:05.450> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> also<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:06.960> trick<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.040> very

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
not it at all that's going to happen is

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
not it at all that's going to happen is
the<00:03:38.910> rice<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.480> going<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.750> turn<00:03:39.960> white<00:03:40.200> again

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the rice is going to turn white again

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.980 
the rice is going to turn white again
it's<00:03:41.100> going<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.370> dry<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.750> going<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
it's going to dry up and it's going to

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.570 
it's going to dry up and it's going to
turn<00:03:43.140> white<00:03:43.410> again<00:03:43.710> so<00:03:43.920> when<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.160> turns<00:03:44.190> white

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
turn white again so when it turns white

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.310 
turn white again so when it turns white
again<00:03:44.880> it's<00:03:45.090> been<00:03:45.270> it's<00:03:45.510> toasted<00:03:45.960> it's<00:03:46.170> not

again it's been it's toasted it's not
going<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.530> turn<00:03:46.680> brown<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.190> then<00:03:47.910> we<00:03:48.030> can

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
going to turn brown and then we can

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.040 
going to turn brown and then we can
continue<00:03:48.360> with<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.930> recipe<00:03:50.930> Colonels<00:03:51.930> have

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
continue with the recipe Colonels have

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.900 
continue with the recipe Colonels have
turned<00:03:52.350> white<00:03:52.590> again<00:03:52.620> hopefully<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.550> can<00:03:53.700> see

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
turned white again hopefully you can see

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.740 
turned white again hopefully you can see
this<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.850> means<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:57.150> can<00:03:57.300> continue<00:03:57.660> with

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
this and that means we can continue with

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:11.380 
this and that means we can continue with
the<00:03:57.900> recipe<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.710> next<00:03:58.980> step<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.490> add<00:03:59.640> one

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.960 

once<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.540> vibrate<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.080> wine<00:04:13.260> completely<00:04:13.970> you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
once we vibrate the wine completely you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.699 
once we vibrate the wine completely you
put<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.330> raw<00:04:15.690> wine<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.260> start<00:04:16.440> pressure

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
put in raw wine and start pressure

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.740 
put in raw wine and start pressure
cooking<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.340> get<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.760> line<00:04:17.970> at<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> end<00:04:18.420> so

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
cooking you get on line at the end so

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.319
