00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.259
 Analyzing the foreplay to the fountain-party code chord with the code before the first chord 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.660
 I'll see. 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.059
 All configuration is negative, for example itjyo are, in this order, give the market its code 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:19.400
 This is how art works. 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:24.470
 No. What Saul doing so when records are there gotta constituent tone control those negative 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.490
 It is not possible to use this stone, 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.800
 I will upload 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:35.840
 I put it up and down the next, 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 It 's used as the base for the code . 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.020
 I 'll take a look at the first one . 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:50.470
 Tendeyo listen 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.470
 There is one undergraduate and one look at the way this music Japanese music usually c 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.809
 Chief a minor 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:07.409
 2 - It will be like this. 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:10.740
 Well, there's something about Shulammy that's a little off-season. 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.060
 A little change of code 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.299
 The second time I'm here and the second time I see / b. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.299
 The constituent notes of the autonomous code are shot . 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:28.020
 Loss of inde poetry when raising and lowering the top of the Soul during that down 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.830
 We use that as the base of the code below. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.520
 Let's see what happens . 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.520
 d / p 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.200
 Ah eimhayi 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.320
 2 - ea 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 In the right word when 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:53.700
 Then make the right yarn in preparation for going to a minor at the time 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:59.100
 In order to make the city LA , 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 I put the g code into the losing g code without playing the low tide 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:09.899
 We play the second chord, Sang Doomin, on the bass first . 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.510
 That's exactly why I hate the bass that I catch up with immediately after playing g 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.030
 / b 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.030
 Let 's take a look at Abdul once more. 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.690
 U 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 When I insert this point normal play / code just like this one undergraduate 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.709
 It will be played like this 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.400
 It's natural that it's the market . 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.020
 In this paper, 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.020
 How to use the fraction code
