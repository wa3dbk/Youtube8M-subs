00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
and ponder said this is the game that
will<00:01:57.750> define<00:01:58.110> my<00:01:58.320> career<00:01:58.680> talking<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
to the postseason there was a couple of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.190 
to the postseason there was a couple of
other<00:02:06.149> scenarios<00:02:06.719> where<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:06.990> could<00:02:07.110> have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
other scenarios where they could have

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.770 
other scenarios where they could have
lost<00:02:07.350> made<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> young<00:02:09.450> quarterback

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
lost made it but for a young quarterback

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.680 
lost made it but for a young quarterback
who's<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> great<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:12.450> be

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
who's not that great as it is to be

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.480 
who's not that great as it is to be
looking<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.140> game<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.710> almost<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.310> his

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
looking at that game as almost like his

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.430 
looking at that game as almost like his
Super<00:02:14.880> Bowl<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.270> don't<00:02:15.690> know<00:02:15.750> Brian<00:02:15.930> Meeks<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
Super Bowl I don't know Brian Meeks it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
Super Bowl I don't know Brian Meeks it
makes<00:02:16.590> me<00:02:16.710> think<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.100> tough<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.370> him

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
makes me think that it's tough for him

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.650 
makes me think that it's tough for him
to<00:02:17.550> come<00:02:17.700> back<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.180> again

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
to come back and do it again

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.730 
to come back and do it again

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the road when they haven't played in a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.180 
the road when they haven't played in a
dome<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.630> hasn't<00:02:51.900> been<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.110> impressive<00:02:52.470> so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
dome it hasn't been that impressive so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.440 
dome it hasn't been that impressive so
it's<00:02:53.340> gonna<00:02:53.460> be<00:02:53.640> interesting<00:02:53.850> how<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.240> works

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
it's gonna be interesting how this works

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.610 
it's gonna be interesting how this works
out<00:02:54.600> I'm<00:02:54.990> gonna<00:02:55.110> play<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> little<00:02:55.530> bit

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
out I'm gonna play a little bit

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.380 
out I'm gonna play a little bit
differently<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.160> think<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.210> take<00:02:57.330> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
differently I think you know you take a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.120

back to his defining his career I think

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.910 
back to his defining his career I think
his<00:04:14.510> career<00:04:14.930> was<00:04:15.110> defined<00:04:15.500> when<00:04:15.710> he<00:04:15.770> got

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
his career was defined when he got

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.890 
his career was defined when he got
married<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.310> Samantha<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:17.299> know<00:04:17.660> probably

there<00:04:18.500> okay<00:04:18.980> so<00:04:19.040> there<00:04:19.370> was<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> good<00:04:19.700> move

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
there okay so there was a good move

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.009 
there okay so there was a good move
there<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.180> think<00:04:20.330> that<00:04:20.510> was<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> big

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
there I think that was the big

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.170 
there I think that was the big

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.730 
he did it at home and he did it kind of
playing<00:04:28.360> downhill<00:04:29.360> because<00:04:29.780> they<00:04:30.410> never

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
playing downhill because they never

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.410 
playing downhill because they never
trailed<00:04:31.130> in<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.520> game<00:04:31.760> last<00:04:31.970> week<00:04:32.270> they

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
trailed in that game last week they

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.570 
trailed in that game last week they
jumped<00:04:32.780> out<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.110> 13<00:04:33.530> nothing<00:04:33.740> lead<00:04:34.130> it's

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
jumped out to a 13 nothing lead it's

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.780 
jumped out to a 13 nothing lead it's
much<00:04:34.970> easier<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:36.020> play<00:04:36.320> at<00:04:36.500> home<00:04:36.680> with<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.400> crowd

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
much easier to play at home with a crowd

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.620 
much easier to play at home with a crowd
a<00:04:38.150> lead<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.470> guy<00:04:39.680> behind<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.880> named<00:04:41.120> Adrian

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
a lead and a guy behind you named Adrian

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.780 
a lead and a guy behind you named Adrian
Peterson<00:04:42.230> he's<00:04:42.980> not<00:04:43.160> going<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.640> the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
Peterson he's not going to have the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.060 
Peterson he's not going to have the
crowd<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.780> think<00:04:45.050> Green<00:04:45.230> Bay<00:04:45.410> jumps<00:04:45.740> out<00:04:45.890> in

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
crowd and I think Green Bay jumps out in

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.120 
crowd and I think Green Bay jumps out in
front<00:04:46.370> in<00:04:47.150> this<00:04:47.330> game<00:04:47.570> with<00:04:48.050> Rogers<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.710> then

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
front in this game with Rogers and then

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.770 
front in this game with Rogers and then
you're<00:04:49.280> playing<00:04:49.550> uphill<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.360> don't<00:04:50.420> think

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
you're playing uphill and I don't think

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.020 
you're playing uphill and I don't think
he<00:04:50.930> makes<00:04:51.170> those<00:04:51.440> pressure<00:04:51.740> throws<00:04:52.190> and<00:04:52.550> he

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
he makes those pressure throws and he

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.730 
he makes those pressure throws and he
caught<00:04:53.270> this<00:04:53.480> Green<00:04:53.960> Bay<00:04:54.140> secondary

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
caught this Green Bay secondary

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.350 
caught this Green Bay secondary
off-guard<00:04:55.640> and<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:55.880> thought<00:04:56.030> he<00:04:56.180> would<00:04:56.330> have

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
off-guard and I thought he would have

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.330 
off-guard and I thought he would have
that<00:04:56.630> opportunity<00:04:57.020> because<00:04:57.770> they<00:04:58.070> would<00:04:58.250> be

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
that opportunity because they would be

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.340 
that opportunity because they would be
keying<00:04:58.610> in<00:04:58.880> on<00:04:59.000> Adrian<00:04:59.420> Peterson<00:04:59.870> going<00:05:00.170> for

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
keying in on Adrian Peterson going for

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.470 
keying in on Adrian Peterson going for
the<00:05:00.440> record<00:05:00.620> sure<00:05:01.040> not<00:05:01.670> gonna<00:05:01.790> have<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.300> this

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
the record sure not gonna have that this

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.150 
the record sure not gonna have that this
week<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:02.900> think<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.470> great<00:05:03.800> spot<00:05:04.100> for

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
week I think this is a great spot for

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.230 
week I think this is a great spot for
the<00:05:04.370> Green<00:05:04.550> Bay<00:05:04.580> Packers

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240
