we'll start by dropping a little bit of

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.820 
we'll start by dropping a little bit of
baby<00:02:47.090> powder<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.570> there<00:02:47.750> cupboards<00:02:48.710> down<00:02:48.800> a

so<00:03:05.640> there<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:05.879> purpose<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.540> does<00:03:06.629> help

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
so there is a purpose and it does help

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.880 
so there is a purpose and it does help
perhaps<00:03:06.989> make<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> little<00:03:07.440> easier<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.860> work

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890

so<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.640> put<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.910> valve<00:03:36.060> stem<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.590> rim<00:03:37.770> first

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
so I put the valve stem in the rim first

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.150 
so I put the valve stem in the rim first
I'll<00:03:39.420> put<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.690> nut<00:03:40.190> pretty<00:03:41.190> far<00:03:41.370> down<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:43.160> can

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
I'll put the nut pretty far down I can

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.640 
I'll put the nut pretty far down I can
get<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.340> tire<00:03:44.660> I'm<00:03:45.660> about<00:03:45.780> 3/4<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.410> way<00:03:46.500> on

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
get the tire I'm about 3/4 the way on

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.559 
get the tire I'm about 3/4 the way on
right<00:03:46.860> now<00:03:47.209> pretty<00:03:48.209> easy

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.740

rim<00:04:01.910> lock<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.240> still<00:04:02.450> expose<00:04:03.230> what<00:04:03.500> we<00:04:03.590> do<00:04:03.710> here

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
rim lock is still expose what we do here

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.590 
rim lock is still expose what we do here
is<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.650> walk<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.130> on<00:04:07.300> as<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.360> hold<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:09.520> push

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
is just walk it on as I hold it I push

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.430 
is just walk it on as I hold it I push
the<00:04:11.600> rim<00:04:11.810> rim<00:04:12.320> walk<00:04:12.530> off

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
the rim rim walk off

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.590 
the rim rim walk off
I'll<00:04:15.130> put<00:04:15.280> some<00:04:15.460> more<00:04:15.640> tire<00:04:16.540> paste<00:04:16.840> on<00:04:17.080> here

finish up the tire
I<00:04:44.169> hold<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.289> rim<00:04:45.439> lock<00:04:45.650> down<00:04:46.189> let<00:04:46.610> me<00:04:46.669> get<00:04:46.789> to

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
I hold the rim lock down let me get to

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.999 
I hold the rim lock down let me get to
there<00:04:47.030> as<00:04:47.569> I'm<00:04:47.900> working<00:04:48.199> on<00:04:48.229> it<00:04:48.469> and<00:04:48.680> then<00:04:48.770> tire

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
there as I'm working on it and then tire

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.659 
there as I'm working on it and then tire
down<00:04:49.849> off<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.419> beat<00:04:51.099> as<00:04:52.099> I<00:04:52.310> work<00:04:52.490> my<00:04:52.520> way

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
down off the beat as I work my way

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.270 
down off the beat as I work my way
around<00:04:52.939> the<00:04:53.150> tire

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
around the tire

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.649 
around the tire
I'm<00:04:55.280> taking<00:04:55.610> my<00:04:55.699> inch<00:04:55.969> and<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.150> half<00:04:56.180> two<00:04:56.509> inch

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
I'm taking my inch and a half two inch

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.490 
I'm taking my inch and a half two inch
bites

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.200 

now<00:04:59.950> it<00:05:00.100> gets<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.490> end<00:05:00.520> here<00:05:00.760> it's<00:05:00.940> easier

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
now it gets to the end here it's easier

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.510 
now it gets to the end here it's easier
just<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.480> ride<00:05:02.290> them<00:05:02.470> take<00:05:02.590> another<00:05:02.800> bite<00:05:02.980> just

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
just to ride them take another bite just

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.720 
just to ride them take another bite just
push<00:05:03.760> it<00:05:03.910> on<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.800> come<00:05:05.950> over<00:05:06.100> here<00:05:06.220> pull<00:05:06.670> my

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
push it on then I come over here pull my

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.839 
push it on then I come over here pull my
feet<00:05:06.940> but<00:05:07.060> now

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:17.800 

here<00:05:10.179> enough

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.809 

and<00:05:18.740> then<00:05:18.889> right<00:05:19.129> away<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.430> first<00:05:19.460> thing<00:05:19.729> you

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
and then right away the first thing you

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.010 
and then right away the first thing you
do<00:05:19.939> is<00:05:20.060> flip<00:05:20.180> it<00:05:20.360> over<00:05:20.509> and<00:05:20.689> show<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:20.900> the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
do is flip it over and show you the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.990 
do is flip it over and show you the
other<00:05:21.080> side<00:05:21.169> because<00:05:21.650> inevitably<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.879> other

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
other side because inevitably the other

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.179 
other side because inevitably the other
side<00:05:23.240> has<00:05:23.509> a<00:05:23.539> problem<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.319> now<00:05:24.590> we're<00:05:24.770> good<00:05:24.949> but

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
side has a problem so now we're good but

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:29.050 
side has a problem so now we're good but
both<00:05:26.150> sides<00:05:26.360> are<00:05:26.629> on<00:05:27.490> first<00:05:28.490> thing<00:05:28.699> you<00:05:28.789> do<00:05:28.909> is

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
both sides are on first thing you do is

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.749 
both sides are on first thing you do is
tighten<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.389> rim<00:05:29.539> lock<00:05:29.689> to<00:05:30.620> make<00:05:30.680> sure<00:05:30.979> that

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
tighten the rim lock to make sure that

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.740 
tighten the rim lock to make sure that
there's<00:05:33.759> nothing<00:05:34.030> caught<00:05:34.210> in<00:05:34.419> there<00:05:34.630> and

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
there's nothing caught in there and

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.170 
there's nothing caught in there and
reports<00:05:35.229> you<00:05:35.289> check<00:05:35.500> tire<00:05:35.710> fits<00:05:35.919> in

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
reports you check tire fits in

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.270 
reports you check tire fits in
check<00:05:37.660> tire<00:05:37.840> pressure<00:05:37.870> we<00:05:38.710> usually<00:05:39.009> run<00:05:39.130> about

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
check tire pressure we usually run about

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.159 
check tire pressure we usually run about
13<00:05:39.789> a<00:05:39.820> good<00:05:40.030> rule<00:05:40.180> of<00:05:40.210> thumb<00:05:40.300> is<00:05:40.479> 13<00:05:40.990> in<00:05:41.110> the
