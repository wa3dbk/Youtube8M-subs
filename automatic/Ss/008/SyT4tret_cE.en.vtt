00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
little problem with that study because

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630 
little problem with that study because
I'm<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.600> sure<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.050> those<00:01:01.260> dogs<00:01:01.590> were<00:01:01.829> jealous

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I'm not sure if those dogs were jealous

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.679 
I'm not sure if those dogs were jealous
or<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:03.809> were<00:01:03.870> confused<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.129> fearful<00:01:05.850> or

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
or if they were confused or fearful or

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.609 
or if they were confused or fearful or
protective<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.250> inanimate<00:01:08.580> objects<00:01:09.619> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
protective of the inanimate objects so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
protective of the inanimate objects so
but<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.250> believe<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.820> animals<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.630> get

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
but I do believe that animals can get

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.190 
but I do believe that animals can get
jealous<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.560> dogs<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.729> jealous<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
jealous and dogs do can get jealous and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.120 
jealous and dogs do can get jealous and
why<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.330> believe<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.920> get

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
why is that so I believe that they get

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.080 
why is that so I believe that they get
jealous<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.880> low

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
jealous because they have low

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.010 
jealous because they have low
self-esteem<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.830> low<00:01:23.009> confidence

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
self-esteem and they have low confidence

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
self-esteem and they have low confidence
and<00:01:25.020> also<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.909> they're<00:01:30.090> maybe

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and also that they that they're maybe

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.499 
and also that they that they're maybe
even<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> their<00:01:31.200> people<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:32.030> teaching<00:01:33.030> them

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
even that their people are teaching them

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.340

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
another animal into the mix then it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
another animal into the mix then it
breaks<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.610> bond<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
breaks that bond and it can make the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
breaks that bond and it can make the
animals<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.350> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.649> nervous

animals a little bit nervous

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.050 
realize that I was any different than
other<00:03:59.349> people<00:03:59.919> I<00:04:00.129> thought<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.549> everybody

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
other people I thought that everybody

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.699 
other people I thought that everybody
just<00:04:01.150> could<00:04:01.629> look<00:04:01.780> at<00:04:01.930> animals<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.500> knew<00:04:02.590> what

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
just could look at animals and knew what

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.559 
just could look at animals and knew what
they<00:04:02.829> were<00:04:02.949> thinking<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.430> feeling<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:04.299> wasn't

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
they were thinking and feeling it wasn't

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.449 
they were thinking and feeling it wasn't
until<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.989> was<00:04:05.079> in<00:04:05.230> my<00:04:05.349> early<00:04:05.530> 20s<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.340> I

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
until I was in my early 20s and I

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.420 
until I was in my early 20s and I
started<00:04:06.849> to<00:04:07.449> study<00:04:07.690> animal<00:04:08.290> training<00:04:08.590> where

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
started to study animal training where

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.460 
started to study animal training where
my<00:04:09.760> instructor<00:04:10.060> started<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.900> tell<00:04:11.079> me<00:04:11.230> oh<00:04:11.260> you

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
my instructor started to tell me oh you

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.509 
my instructor started to tell me oh you
have<00:04:11.680> something<00:04:11.859> different<00:04:12.310> with<00:04:12.400> the

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
have something different with the

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.939 
have something different with the
animals<00:04:13.030> they<00:04:13.299> they<00:04:13.780> come<00:04:14.139> along<00:04:14.349> faster<00:04:14.799> with

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
animals they they come along faster with

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.979 
animals they they come along faster with
you<00:04:15.160> they<00:04:15.519> react<00:04:15.819> differently<00:04:16.209> with<00:04:16.539> you<00:04:16.720> what

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you they react differently with you what

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.650 
you they react differently with you what
are<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.109> doing<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.639> then<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.299> started

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
are you doing and so then then I started

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.390 
are you doing and so then then I started
to<00:04:19.750> study<00:04:19.989> it<00:04:20.229> but<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.650> believe<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.130> anyone

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
to study it but I believe that anyone

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.629 
to study it but I believe that anyone
who's<00:04:21.579> close<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:21.909> their<00:04:22.180> animal

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
who's close to their animal

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.969 
who's close to their animal
is<00:04:22.759> talking<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:23.509> their<00:04:23.629> animal<00:04:24.050> all<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.439> time

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
is talking to their animal all the time

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.950 
is talking to their animal all the time
I<00:04:25.009> mean<00:04:25.460> oftentimes<00:04:25.939> our<00:04:26.270> animals<00:04:26.629> can<00:04:26.780> come

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
I mean oftentimes our animals can come

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.629 
I mean oftentimes our animals can come
up<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.409> us<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.830> then<00:04:27.949> all<00:04:28.099> of<00:04:28.129> a<00:04:28.249> sudden<00:04:28.280> you'll

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
up to us and then all of a sudden you'll

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.850
