00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.819 

we<00:00:00.390> just<00:00:00.599> got<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.840> cold-pressed<00:00:01.110> juicer<00:00:01.650> just

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
we just got the cold-pressed juicer just

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.390 
we just got the cold-pressed juicer just
in<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.939> was<00:00:03.090> really<00:00:03.360> curious<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:04.350> see<00:00:04.770> what

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
in and I was really curious to see what

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.880 
in and I was really curious to see what
the<00:00:05.609> comparison<00:00:06.569> would<00:00:06.660> be<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:07.109> how<00:00:07.710> much

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
the comparison would be on how much

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.799 
the comparison would be on how much
juice<00:00:08.400> each<00:00:08.730> one<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.030> these<00:00:09.090> producers<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.660> wish

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
juice each one of these producers I wish

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.669 
juice each one of these producers I wish
somebody<00:00:10.080> would<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.260> done<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.559> online

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
somebody would have done it online

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
somebody would have done it online
nobody<00:00:11.219> did<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.450> put<00:00:12.570> one

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
nobody did so I'm going to put one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.150 
nobody did so I'm going to put one
together<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.200> real<00:00:13.410> quick<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> quick

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
together for you real quick a quick

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.220 
together for you real quick a quick
video<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.580> show<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.139> comparison<00:00:16.139> between

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
video to show you the comparison between

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380 
video to show you the comparison between
the<00:00:16.500> output<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:17.100> these<00:00:17.220> two<00:00:17.400> machines<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.119> if

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the output of these two machines so if

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
the output of these two machines so if
you<00:00:18.990> don't<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> centrifugal<00:00:20.490> juicer

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you don't know what a centrifugal juicer

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
you don't know what a centrifugal juicer
is<00:00:21.090> that's<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:22.109> ours<00:00:22.859> looks<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.220> right

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
is that's what ours looks like right

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
is that's what ours looks like right
there<00:00:23.609> anyway<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> way<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> centrifugal

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
there anyway but the way the centrifugal

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740 
there anyway but the way the centrifugal
juicer<00:00:25.710> works<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.760> chops<00:00:27.090> everything<00:00:27.630> up

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
juicer works is it chops everything up

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
juicer works is it chops everything up
into<00:00:28.019> real<00:00:28.199> fine<00:00:28.470> little<00:00:28.710> pieces<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.220> then

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
into real fine little pieces and then

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
into real fine little pieces and then
spits<00:00:29.820> those<00:00:29.970> pieces<00:00:30.240> onto<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> screen<00:00:31.140> that's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
spits those pieces onto a screen that's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.740 
spits those pieces onto a screen that's
spinning<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:31.949> fast<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:33.420> through

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
spinning really fast and then through

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.770 
spinning really fast and then through
centrifugal<00:00:34.290> force<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.489> juice<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> extracted

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
centrifugal force the juice is extracted

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.090 
centrifugal force the juice is extracted
and<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.020> catches<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> juice<00:00:37.800> from<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and it catches all the juice from that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.869 
and it catches all the juice from that
screen<00:00:38.460> spits<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.510> discards<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.879> solid

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
screen spits out or discards the solid

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.360 
screen spits out or discards the solid
stuff<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.610> cold-pressed<00:00:44.610> juicer<00:00:45.320> basically

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
stuff the cold-pressed juicer basically

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
stuff the cold-pressed juicer basically
pushes<00:00:47.370> everything<00:00:47.700> through<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.390> auger<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
pushes everything through an auger and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
pushes everything through an auger and
then<00:00:49.620> spits<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> solid<00:00:50.700> stuff<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
then spits out the solid stuff and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
then spits out the solid stuff and
basically<00:00:51.480> squeezes<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> juice<00:00:53.850> out

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
basically squeezes all of the juice out

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
basically squeezes all of the juice out
of<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.949> reason<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.850> cold

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of it and the reason we got the cold

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.840 
of it and the reason we got the cold
press<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.890> because<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.219> couple<00:00:59.460> different

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
press is because a couple different

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.200 
press is because a couple different
things

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
things

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.500 
things
supposedly<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.350> produce<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:01.920> juice<00:01:02.510> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
supposedly they produce more juice so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.530 
supposedly they produce more juice so
you're<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.989> through<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> lot<00:01:04.350> less<00:01:04.530> produce

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
you're going through a lot less produce

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.260 
you're going through a lot less produce
it's<00:01:06.650> colder<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> process<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.369> colder<00:01:08.820> or

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's colder the process is colder or

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
it's colder the process is colder or
it's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.659> hot<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.049> other<00:01:10.170> words<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:10.650> say

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's not hot in other words and they say

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
it's not hot in other words and they say
that<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.460> centripetal<00:01:12.180> juicer<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
that the centripetal juicer because the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
that the centripetal juicer because the
heat<00:01:13.920> kills<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> nutrients<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.390> not

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
heat kills a lot of nutrients so not

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
heat kills a lot of nutrients so not
only<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> getting<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.310> juice<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.880> of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
only are you getting more juice out of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
only are you getting more juice out of
what<00:01:18.270> you're<00:01:18.479> grinding<00:01:19.290> through<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> thing

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
what you're grinding through this thing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
what you're grinding through this thing
but<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.520> getting<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.750> nutrients

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
but you're also getting more nutrients

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.420 
but you're also getting more nutrients
out<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.650> too<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.990> also<00:01:25.259> quiet<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
out of it too and it's also quiet so the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310 
out of it too and it's also quiet so the
centripetal<00:01:27.180> juicer<00:01:27.360> you'll<00:01:27.750> hear<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
centripetal juicer you'll hear here in a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
centripetal juicer you'll hear here in a
second<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.100> makes<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.700> noise<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
second it makes a lot more noise so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.550 
second it makes a lot more noise so
we're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> test<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> difference

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we're going to test the difference

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140 
we're going to test the difference
between<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.979> output<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.430> both<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.700> these<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
between the output of both of these and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.080 
between the output of both of these and
it's<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.409> scientific<00:01:34.619> test<00:01:35.310> because

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it's not a very scientific test because

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
it's not a very scientific test because
I<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.840> haven't<00:01:37.170> waved<00:01:37.560> these<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
I actually haven't waved these but I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.859 
I actually haven't waved these but I
just<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.880> eyeballed<00:01:39.240> everything<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
just kind of eyeballed everything and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.880 
just kind of eyeballed everything and
here's<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.170> we're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> put<00:01:40.560> into<00:01:40.740> each

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
here's what we're going to put into each

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
here's what we're going to put into each
machine<00:01:41.360> we've<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.509> celery<00:01:43.909> carrots<00:01:44.909> apples

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
machine we've got celery carrots apples

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.740 
machine we've got celery carrots apples
a<00:01:46.140> roma<00:01:46.799> tomato<00:01:47.100> radish<00:01:47.399> part<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> beet

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
a roma tomato radish part of the beet

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
a roma tomato radish part of the beet
and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.229> some<00:01:49.439> parsley<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.700> really

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and then some parsley and I'm really

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.399 
and then some parsley and I'm really
curious<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> coldpressed<00:01:52.049> does

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
curious to see what the coldpressed does

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.039 
curious to see what the coldpressed does
with<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> parsley<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.220> our<00:01:53.549> centrifugal

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
with the parsley because our centrifugal

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.569 
with the parsley because our centrifugal
doesn't<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.170> very<00:01:55.200> well<00:01:55.530> with<00:01:55.920> real<00:01:56.159> leafy

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
doesn't do very well with real leafy

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.870 
doesn't do very well with real leafy
type<00:01:57.320> vegetables<00:01:58.320> or<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.729> does

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
type vegetables or because what it does

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.719 
type vegetables or because what it does
is<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.119> spits<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.689> out<00:02:00.869> instead<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:02.189> chopping

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
is it spits them out instead of chopping

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
is it spits them out instead of chopping
it<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.140> don't<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.469> very<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:04.799> juice<00:02:05.070> out

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it up so I don't get very much juice out

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.920 
it up so I don't get very much juice out
of<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.610> machine<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
of it in the machine so we're going to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.650 
of it in the machine so we're going to
test<00:02:07.140> both<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.530> them<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.860> tell<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> already

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
test both of them I can tell you already

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.089 
test both of them I can tell you already
what<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:10.160> don't<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.340> about<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.090> cold<00:02:12.480> press

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
what I don't like about the cold press

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.750 
what I don't like about the cold press
is<00:02:13.159> that<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:14.900> mouth<00:02:15.109> on<00:02:15.469> it<00:02:15.680> where<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.370> feed

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
is that the mouth on it where you feed

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.509 
is that the mouth on it where you feed
everything<00:02:17.060> into<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.659> pretty<00:02:17.870> small<00:02:18.519> compared

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
everything into is pretty small compared

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.420 
everything into is pretty small compared
to<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.939> mouth<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.659> this<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.439> triple<00:02:21.829> where<00:02:22.400> I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
to the mouth on this and triple where I

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.610 
to the mouth on this and triple where I
can<00:02:22.609> throw<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:23.090> whole<00:02:23.420> Apple<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:25.389> but

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
can throw a whole Apple in there but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.220 
can throw a whole Apple in there but
I'll<00:02:27.620> chop<00:02:28.249> these<00:02:28.430> things<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:28.999> for<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.959> cold

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
I'll chop these things up for the cold

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.959 
I'll chop these things up for the cold
press<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.739> then<00:02:30.950> we're<00:02:31.069> going<00:02:31.189> to<00:02:31.250> see<00:02:31.819> what

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
press and then we're going to see what

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.780 
press and then we're going to see what
the<00:02:32.060> difference<00:02:32.359> is<00:02:32.480> between<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.870> two

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the difference is between the two

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.520 
the difference is between the two
okay<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:34.849> let's<00:02:35.120> turn<00:02:35.569> on<00:02:35.689> this<00:02:35.810> intrical<00:02:36.319> and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
okay so let's turn on this intrical and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.039 
okay so let's turn on this intrical and
gets<00:02:37.189> thing<00:02:37.400> going<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.090> plastic<00:02:38.450> bag<00:02:38.629> is<00:02:38.659> over

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
gets thing going the plastic bag is over

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.780 
gets thing going the plastic bag is over
here<00:02:39.169> just<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.469> catch<00:02:39.650> everything<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.430> have

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
here just to catch everything so I have

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.879 
here just to catch everything so I have
a<00:02:40.819> little<00:02:41.030> bit<00:02:41.120> less<00:02:41.239> cleanup<00:02:41.629> work<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.530> we'll

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
a little bit less cleanup work but we'll

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.349 
a little bit less cleanup work but we'll
get<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.099> thing<00:02:43.280> cranked<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.939> here's

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
get this thing cranked in and here's

00:02:44.359 --> 00:03:12.260 
get this thing cranked in and here's
what<00:02:44.480> we're<00:02:44.569> going<00:02:44.659> to<00:02:44.749> put<00:02:44.900> into<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.169> again

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.820 

okay<00:03:13.270> so<00:03:13.330> I'm<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.690> let<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.810> go<00:03:14.800> for

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
okay so I'm going to let that go for

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.500 
okay so I'm going to let that go for
just<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.430> bit<00:03:15.550> longer<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.060> squeeze<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
just a little bit longer to squeeze the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.850 
just a little bit longer to squeeze the
rest<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.840> juice<00:03:17.080> out<00:03:19.500> or<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> should<00:03:20.710> say

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
rest of that juice out or I should say

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.510 
rest of that juice out or I should say
push<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.340> rest<00:03:21.520> of<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.670> juice<00:03:21.940> out<00:03:26.520> one

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
push the rest of that juice out one

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.890 
push the rest of that juice out one
thing<00:03:27.670> you'll<00:03:27.790> notice<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.210> I<00:03:28.360> put<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.720> in

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
thing you'll notice is I put this in

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.340 
thing you'll notice is I put this in
Tripucka<00:03:29.200> by<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.680> sink<00:03:30.100> because<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.630> air<00:03:31.930> in

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
Tripucka by the sink because the air in

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.030 
Tripucka by the sink because the air in
this<00:03:33.130> thing<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.330> kind<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.900> forces<00:03:35.290> air<00:03:35.650> out

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
this thing it it kind of forces air out

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.060 
this thing it it kind of forces air out
this<00:03:36.370> spout<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.990> sprays<00:03:38.440> sometimes

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
this spout here and it sprays sometimes

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.070 
this spout here and it sprays sometimes
so<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.700> if<00:03:40.270> I'm<00:03:40.480> doing<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:40.870> by<00:03:41.020> the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
so I like to if I'm doing this by the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.360 
so I like to if I'm doing this by the
sink<00:03:41.350> you'll<00:03:41.500> see<00:03:41.650> some<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> carrots

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
sink you'll see some of the carrots

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.160 
sink you'll see some of the carrots
sprayed<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:42.940> there<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> little<00:03:45.490> bit<00:03:45.580> messy

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
sprayed in there it's a little bit messy

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.210 
sprayed in there it's a little bit messy
just<00:03:47.170> by<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.380> way<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.680> have<00:03:47.860> these<00:03:48.010> things

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
just by the way they have these things

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.570 
just by the way they have these things
sometimes<00:03:49.890> okay<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:50.980> looks<00:03:51.130> like<00:03:51.280> that's<00:03:51.400> it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
sometimes okay it looks like that's it

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.470 
sometimes okay it looks like that's it
for<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.850> centrifugal<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.170> made<00:03:54.150> out<00:03:55.150> of

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
for the centrifugal so it made out of

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.680 
for the centrifugal so it made out of
what<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:56.080> put<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.380> there<00:03:57.300> just<00:03:58.300> over

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
what we just put in there just over

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.420 
what we just put in there just over
probably<00:03:58.960> a<00:03:59.140> full<00:03:59.620> glass<00:03:59.800> if<00:04:00.070> you<00:04:00.130> go<00:04:00.250> right<00:04:00.400> up

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
probably a full glass if you go right up

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.850 
probably a full glass if you go right up
to<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.670> lip<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.030> glass<00:04:01.350> okay<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.380> forgot<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
to the lip of the glass okay I forgot to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.070 
to the lip of the glass okay I forgot to
put<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.390> parsley<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.420> just<00:04:04.660> caught<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.840> so

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
put the parsley I just caught that so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.150 
put the parsley I just caught that so
let<00:04:05.170> me<00:04:05.260> throw<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.440> parsley<00:04:05.740> in<00:04:05.920> here<00:04:06.040> real

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
let me throw the parsley in here real

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:19.069 
let me throw the parsley in here real
quick

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.170 

it's<00:04:19.470> like<00:04:19.590> almost<00:04:19.769> heard<00:04:20.099> nothing<00:04:20.579> grind<00:04:20.940> up

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
it's like almost heard nothing grind up

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.120 
it's like almost heard nothing grind up
because<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.780> just<00:04:21.959> spit<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.500> parsley<00:04:22.860> back

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
because it just spit the parsley back

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.309 
because it just spit the parsley back
out<00:04:23.400> some<00:04:24.300> juicers<00:04:24.660> are<00:04:24.810> better<00:04:24.990> than<00:04:25.229> others

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
out some juicers are better than others

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.219 
out some juicers are better than others
but<00:04:28.039> don't<00:04:29.039> even<00:04:29.370> see<00:04:29.490> any<00:04:29.639> green<00:04:29.849> in<00:04:30.060> there

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
but don't even see any green in there

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.730 
but don't even see any green in there
you<00:04:31.229> see

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
you see

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.710 
you see
the<00:04:32.250> parsley<00:04:32.610> got<00:04:32.819> spit<00:04:33.180> out<00:04:33.210> back<00:04:33.509> here

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
the parsley got spit out back here

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.360 
the parsley got spit out back here
almost<00:04:34.020> whole<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.650> don't<00:04:34.949> like<00:04:35.039> that<00:04:35.220> about

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
almost whole so I don't like that about

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.890 
almost whole so I don't like that about
that's<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.300> thing<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:36.509> really<00:04:36.539> don't<00:04:36.750> like

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
that's one thing I really don't like

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.650 
that's one thing I really don't like
about<00:04:37.199> that<00:04:37.319> machine<00:04:38.449> now<00:04:39.449> we're<00:04:39.599> doing

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
about that machine now we're doing

00:04:39.660 --> 00:05:29.470 
about that machine now we're doing
everything<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.530> coal<00:04:40.830> press

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.520 

all<00:05:30.480> right<00:05:30.660> so<00:05:30.900> we're<00:05:31.200> going<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.350> continue

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
all right so we're going to continue

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.260 
all right so we're going to continue
this<00:05:31.890> now<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.190> swapped<00:05:32.580> out<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.850> glass<00:05:33.060> I

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
this now I swapped out the glass I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.730 
this now I swapped out the glass I
stopped<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.690> other<00:05:33.720> glass<00:05:34.140> around<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.560> same

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
stopped the other glass around the same

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.070 
stopped the other glass around the same
level<00:05:34.850> that<00:05:35.850> our<00:05:35.970> first<00:05:36.180> glass<00:05:36.510> stop<00:05:36.900> we're

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
level that our first glass stop we're

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.270 
level that our first glass stop we're
going<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.260> put<00:05:37.350> them<00:05:37.410> side-by-side<00:05:37.680> in<00:05:38.220> a

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
going to put them side-by-side in a

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.640 
going to put them side-by-side in a
second<00:05:38.700> but<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:39.090> wanted<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.720> show<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.410> Leafs

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
second but I wanted to show the Leafs

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:54.500 
second but I wanted to show the Leafs
the<00:05:40.950> leafy<00:05:41.760> greens<00:05:42.060> in<00:05:42.300> here

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.840 

so<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.140> can<00:05:55.290> see<00:05:55.530> that<00:05:55.770> it's<00:05:56.220> getting<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.670> lot

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
so you can see that it's getting a lot

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:25.220 
so you can see that it's getting a lot
more<00:05:56.880> juice<00:05:57.390> out<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.630> leafy<00:05:58.050> greens

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.220 

okay<00:06:26.230> so<00:06:26.290> here's<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.370> the<00:06:28.210> actual<00:06:28.480> result<00:06:28.960> you

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
okay so here's the the actual result you

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.670 
okay so here's the the actual result you
have<00:06:29.410> the<00:06:29.650> tall<00:06:29.860> glasses<00:06:30.190> we<00:06:30.670> have<00:06:31.680> full

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
have the tall glasses we have full

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.980 
have the tall glasses we have full
almost<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:33.160> the<00:06:33.250> very<00:06:33.430> top<00:06:33.730> there<00:06:34.030> and<00:06:35.280> then

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
almost to the very top there and then

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.980 
almost to the very top there and then
it's<00:06:37.990> actually<00:06:38.170> based<00:06:39.040> on<00:06:39.430> this<00:06:39.990> the

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
it's actually based on this the

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.930 
it's actually based on this the
centrifugal<00:06:41.650> made<00:06:42.070> a<00:06:42.480> little<00:06:43.480> bit<00:06:43.630> more<00:06:43.840> juice

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
centrifugal made a little bit more juice

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.460 
centrifugal made a little bit more juice
when<00:06:45.940> you<00:06:46.060> bring<00:06:46.390> it<00:06:46.510> down<00:06:46.540> to<00:06:46.840> those<00:06:46.990> two<00:06:47.260> last

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
when you bring it down to those two last

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.520 
when you bring it down to those two last
glasses<00:06:48.070> so<00:06:48.480> the<00:06:49.480> centrifugal<00:06:49.960> actually

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
glasses so the centrifugal actually

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:59.610 
glasses so the centrifugal actually
produces<00:06:51.040> more<00:06:51.280> juice

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.680 

you
