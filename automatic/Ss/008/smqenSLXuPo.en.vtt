00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.550
 from this election we are 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:11.549
 finding one with chords with another 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.309
 level of difficulty is important before 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.520
 to throw us head to try to touch 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.590
 repertoire try to secure first 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.130
 the fingerings of the chords try 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.370
 strengthening of the bonds between the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.710
 chords because one of the big 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.710
 enemies of learning at this point 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.260
 is the frustration then it happens that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 we have a chord of a song includes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.890
 a minor chord 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 then we are playing very well 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 our chords open and in the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 moment we want to talk about 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.199
 chords and minor our song is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.149
 stops is locked and we started 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.860
 frustrate and that's the reason why 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.140
 instead of practicing three hours 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.150
 we practiced 20 minutes because we 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.290
 we feel very bad with ourselves for 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.430
 the fact of not being able to advance in the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.900
 song for the fact that the song 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.560
 do not sound musical then if we 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.409
 we have secured that 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.020
 the previous step of which the agreed sounds to me 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.600
 well that removing the difficulty of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.320
 play the full song including the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.390
 rhythm in right hand and so on the chord 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.729
 it comes out to me in a certain natural way 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.480
 the repertoire learning is done to me 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.510
 much more fluid 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.870
 another very important thing and that is very 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.580
 common is to stop us stop our 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.860
 our song stop the rhythm the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.390
 application the moment we get to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.890
 a chord that is complicated 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.580
 so for example if I have the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.580
 sequence to make 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 only the minor 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.850
 fa 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.850
 it is very common to do this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.799
 so what happens if we 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 we forgive the fact of not knowing the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.220
 chord 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.030
 let's perpetuate that patient behavior 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.700
 it means that we will not care 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 letters in the chord then 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.200
 some strategies point 1 lower the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.610
 speed drastically lower the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.390
 rhythm speed is not pace speed is 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.390
 consistency very well then 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.130
 do not 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.370
 and 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.769
 all right 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.099
 my song will be much more the song that 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.099
 it has become 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.440
 and the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.440
 the crossing speed to change the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.280
 newborn alpha 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.750
 in the same one that you use to change alpha in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.100
 the slowest version the most 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.680
 slow sounds more musical 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.510
 another important thing is 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.790
 force our right hand that does not 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.060
 never stop only in strokes towards 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.060
 down 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.420
 at a steady pace 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 yes the thing 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.280
 It takes fantastic time if it does not take 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.590
 time tried to accommodate it is the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.960
 simulation of a real musical situation 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.130
 we will not always fall to all 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.550
 chords 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.440
 with the same delegation but we can not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.690
 allow us the subject of the people 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.690
 then we download the version 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.750
 and simulated the error 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.750
 all right 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.220
 I have the chord well placed that gives 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.080
 the sequence to my music 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.590
 if I'm accompanying someone is 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.000
 singing is not going to be so annoying the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.390
 fact that a note two notes do not 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.180
 they usually do everything in that I 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.019
 stop to create a chord for 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.019
 force him to type the right thing
