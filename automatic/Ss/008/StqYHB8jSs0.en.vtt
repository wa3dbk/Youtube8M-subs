00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.480
 fountain 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.320
 minecraft in general yes yes I am generally stitched 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.970
 show make video cost beautiful 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.429
 the fountain it can be the decoration of your 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 full on your server or it can 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.140
 just be like cards even if you 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.300
 make a map on the passage all either 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 making maps on the passage is not so well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.660
 well let's start so we will 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 build a fountain in fact there are two 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.510
 option fountain dilapidated fountain 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.600
 and usually the foundation it will be so unusual 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 let's generally mean we bet 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.020
 will need stone glass every brick 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.789
 and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 and a bucket of water but it is natural it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.329
 fountain on is it possible from fountains of glory but i 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.570
 I think that the water bouquets more interesting well 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.460
 In general, to whom, as it means, we are building here 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 such a simple design and it means yes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.259
 here and so we build four blocks and here we are 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.070
 we also build you so that you can 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.710
 and so means we need to generally arrange 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.650
 repeat everything consistently and then u 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.299
 you get a beautiful fountain so in 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.170
 in general, this is how we further customize 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:38.590
 kind of like that but still well 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 Well, I 'm talking to the server so well. 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.609
 it seems we have got this 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.229
 neatly I am such a construction and 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.549
 now here we are looking here here is the center and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.170
 we build how many block resad you have 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.119
 will be with a lamp in fact a fountain can 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.469
 to be very tall I think I understand well 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.459
 I will make a small fountain 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.799
 and let me show you how it is 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:22.959
 It is meant here and so on 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:28.799
 set up here as well, let us 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:36.660
 let's do it let's make it an iron block 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.660
 interestingly it was clearly 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:44.950
 well and also such fountains 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.180
 well, this is just an option you suggest 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.870
 can of course your fountain 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.239
 build and in general then yes it will 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.370
 I think it will be a beautiful design for 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.130
 spawn recommend this fountain here 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.569
 here these blocks and we do not put there 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:06.730
 there will be something after another show here 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.739
 let's not just like this 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.739
 we finish building a cube all this body 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400
 So 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.030
 by the way I have to tell you what you see 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.989
 I throw a new one on the go dude out 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.989
 MythBusters 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.600
 this 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.600
 like this 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.800
 and you probably ask why I left 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.769
 places here well in general then in order to 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.629
 then that's all, but I'll tell you 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.280
 We built up the glass and then later to 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.250
 shoot a cyclone dunin painted 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:02.260
 sidewalls and as I said and such 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.959
 Fountains can be made very high 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:14.319
 can not very high so in general and 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:17.320
 here he is building everything now 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.400
 useful glass in the warm then weak here 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.400
 we build a spring 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.710
 so here 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.949
 and here we are 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:47.249
 we can still and so take and close 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.249
 all close 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:02.760
 and our whole mandate is ready to be extended 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.800
 more about a couple of pop and here it is 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.650
 such a fountain can be obtained of course 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.530
 here is the same here make glass here 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.960
 to do well, where it was the same glass 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.790
 Further you can think how I looking 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.250
 why is it amazing to lose then 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.380
 I just have a server you create a card 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.310
 In general, here is this fountain you can 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:27.250
 turn out pretty think interesting and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.020
 unusually well, well on the light of all 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.490
