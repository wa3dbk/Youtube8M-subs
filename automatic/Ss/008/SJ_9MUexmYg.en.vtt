00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Today we make ravioli from honey and roquefort cheese. 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.380
 One of my favorite desserts. 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.000
 With honey you can of course make many different dishes, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.429
 but one of my favorite desserts is the open ravioli with roquefort cheese. 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.470
 How do you start? Fairly simple, don't flip. 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.419
 We have 300 grams of honey here that we are going to caramelize in our pan 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.649
 and we will then extinguish it with 200 grams of warm water. 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.859
 It is really important that it is hot water, 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.420
 otherwise the shock is too great. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.379
 Your caramel is too hot and your cold water actually cools it off immediately 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.420
 And then you have those chunks, so that's not the intention. 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.890
 While our honey is melting nicely, 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.019
 we will soak 5 gelatin leaves in cold water. 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.809
 To caramelize our honey, we need a temperature of 135 degrees. 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.350

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.609
 Of course, be super careful when making caramel. 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.449
 I can assure you: one such a spatter and you have a tattoo for the rest of your life. 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.880
 134.5 ... Exciting. 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.720
 Okay, 135. And now we're going to put out our hot water. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.970
 Perfecto. 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.619
 Voila, we are now going to do a little bond with that. 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.439
 I use two binders. 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.750
 Of course our gelatin leaves but also a little bit of agar agar. 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.850
 I think if you use pure gelatin, 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.329
 then that is too firm and you really have those chunks. 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.740
 And agar agar actually provides a nice balance between the two bonds. 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.039
 Add 1.5 grams of that agar agar. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
 We will mix that out a little bit. 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.899
 Voila. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.320
 And we naturally use our gelatin sheets as a second binder. 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.799
 We will wring them out well. 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.430
 And you can also add it to our warm mass. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.979
 We melt our gelatin leaves nicely away 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.880
 and now we are going to pour that out nicely on a little bit of plastic that we oil. 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520
 Neither exaggerate nor too much oil. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.410
 And now we are going to pour out our mass on that picture. 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.200
 I try to form as few air bubbles as possible. 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.460
 Woepsa. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.660
 And now we are going to let it stiffen and then in the fridge. Okay? 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.020
 Biebedie Babedie Tree. 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.140
 The next step is of course the filling of our ravioli. 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.900
 I now use roquefort cheese, but I always provide a little bit of crunch in it. 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.520
 Voila, my preference goes to walnuts. We are not going to exaggerate. 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.970
 We are going to cut it into pieces. 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.570
 Not too small, we are not supposed to get some kind of powder or flour from walnuts. 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.660
 The ratio is always 50 - 50 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.010
 So I have 100 grams of cream and 100 grams of roquefort cheese here 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 I'm going to put it in small pieces and they can all go with the cream. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.020
 And now we're going to beat that half. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.500
 Now I only have to add those walnuts there. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.760
 We leave that aside for a while and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.340
 in the meantime, our gelatin of honey has risen nicely. 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.620
 Our bottom is already on it. 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.300
 Look what a fantastic beautiful cream this has become. 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.680
 Voila and now we will close our ravioli again very nicely. 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.920
 In terms of color, we have to pimp that a little. 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.270
 I have those edible pansies here 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.340
 and that way we of course also make the link 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.200
 with the delicious nectar from the flowers and honey. 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.220
 Fantastic combination: honey, sweetness, and yet spicy cheese. 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.080
