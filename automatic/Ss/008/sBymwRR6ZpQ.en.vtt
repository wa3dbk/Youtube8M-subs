00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello, I decided to show how 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.340
 does the ventilator for this do 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.980
 booth which connected the standard 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.789
 ventilator itself 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.710
 all mounts are standard 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.669
 so for more severe conditions 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.399
 exploitation still on the chest I loaded 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:31.630
 window pane with two bricks outside the box 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.960
 we just have the sun as the sun 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.220
 we use a gas burner 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.220
 starting to warm air 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.190
 does not immediately start earning 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.470
 the ventilator and immediately starts 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.060
 push stock velas 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.060
 despite these 2 bricks 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:06.310
 prohibitive weight actually 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.860
 we use it only to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.860
 show what effort keeps 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 ventilator 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.940
 standard conditions never such 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 no effort arises 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.680
 you see something started to move forward 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.740
 bricks 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.740
 in place no one cleaned them anywhere 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 I'll tell you one thing 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.180
 given the lever these bricks create 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.180
 force on stock 40 kilograms 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.100
 which in turn leads to an increase 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.290
 pressure to air up to 100 atmospheres 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.810
 I was surprised when I counted 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.350
 no structural element airs 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.860
 not designed for such operation 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.370
 so I ask you on your greenhouse so 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.370
 not to do 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.909
 if you remove the bricks then the window leaf 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.409
 already fully open because it is 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:28.599
 pressure creates elastic deformation like 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:33.129
 in the pipe itself and on the gaskets and 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.129
 rubber sealing ventilator 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.910
 we will now remove the bricks 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.569
 here is one removed see with one brick 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:56.780
 how do you look airing under 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.780
 this way taking into account winter conditions 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:07.190
 creating an artificial sun we 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.190
 ventilators aired oh 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.190
 aired 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:19.700
 our workshop under the table thank you 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.700
 thank you for attention
