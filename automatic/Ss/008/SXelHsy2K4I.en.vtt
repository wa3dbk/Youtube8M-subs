deck about ten asymmetrical cards by
that<00:00:41.899> I<00:00:41.930> mean<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:42.470> cards<00:00:43.250> which<00:00:43.430> look

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
that I mean in cards which look

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.380 
that I mean in cards which look
different<00:00:45.370> when<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.610> turn<00:00:46.910> them<00:00:47.090> upside<00:00:47.210> down

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
different when you turn them upside down

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.490 
different when you turn them upside down
so<00:00:47.899> they<00:00:48.110> there's<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:49.010> diamond<00:00:49.910> at<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.149> top

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500

turn upside down it's at the bottom okay

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.740 
turn upside down it's at the bottom okay
whereas<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.730> symmetrical<00:00:56.510> card

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
whereas that is a symmetrical card

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.869 
whereas that is a symmetrical card
because<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:57.290> turn<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.680> around<00:00:57.710> it's<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.790> same

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
because we turn it around it's the same

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.369 
because we turn it around it's the same
whichever<00:01:01.879> way<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:02.120> look<00:01:02.300> at<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.290> you're

whichever way you look at it so you're

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.649

do<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:24.240> get<00:02:25.240> all<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.260> cards<00:02:27.030> facing<00:02:28.030> down

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
do now is get all the cards facing down

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.270 
do now is get all the cards facing down
so<00:02:29.680> if<00:02:30.490> there's<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:31.330> more<00:02:31.570> spot<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
so if there's one more spot on on the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.830 
so if there's one more spot on on the
bottom<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.570> want<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:36.190> closest<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.000> so

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
bottom you want it closest to you so

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.390 
bottom you want it closest to you so
would<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.020> turn<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.710> was<00:02:38.860> like<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.220> we

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
would it turn that that was like that we

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.950 
would it turn that that was like that we
need<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> turn<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.820> around<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.360> pointing

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
need to turn it around so it's pointing

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.980 
need to turn it around so it's pointing
towards<00:02:41.320> me<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.820> one<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.630> need<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> turn

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
towards me and this one we need to turn

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.410 
towards me and this one we need to turn
it<00:02:44.050> around<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.710> say<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.460> Club<00:02:46.210> in<00:02:46.330> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
it around because say that Club in the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.850 
it around because say that Club in the
middle<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.780> pointing<00:02:47.170> towards<00:02:47.530> me

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
middle is pointing towards me

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.450 
middle is pointing towards me
I'll<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.670> for<00:02:48.850> each<00:02:49.270> of<00:02:49.660> them<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.250> that's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
I'll do that for each of them so that's

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.330 
I'll do that for each of them so that's
fine<00:02:51.700> because<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.210> pointing<00:02:52.750> down<00:02:53.340> turn

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
fine because it's pointing down turn

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.600 
fine because it's pointing down turn
that<00:02:54.370> round<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.380> because<00:02:56.380> it's<00:02:56.620> pointing

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
that round and because it's pointing

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.280 
that round and because it's pointing
down<00:02:57.640> turn<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.480> right<00:02:58.660> there<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:59.020> keep<00:02:59.200> that

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
down turn it right there to keep that

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.010 
down turn it right there to keep that
the<00:02:59.410> same<00:02:59.440> because<00:02:59.950> it's<00:03:00.070> closest<00:03:00.520> today<00:03:01.020> turn

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
the same because it's closest today turn

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.840 
the same because it's closest today turn

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
it so and if he hasn't turned it we need

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.500 
it so and if he hasn't turned it we need
to<00:04:19.120> turn<00:04:19.419> our<00:04:19.720> cut<00:04:20.109> our<00:04:20.320> deck<00:04:20.760> if<00:04:21.760> he<00:04:22.000> does<00:04:22.240> turn

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
to turn our cut our deck if he does turn

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.430 
to turn our cut our deck if he does turn
it<00:04:22.889> we<00:04:23.889> keep<00:04:24.160> our<00:04:24.610> deck<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.300> same<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.110> in

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
it we keep our deck the same so this in

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.110 
it we keep our deck the same so this in
this<00:04:26.620> example<00:04:27.100> he's<00:04:27.310> turned<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.700> card<00:04:27.910> around

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
this example he's turned the card around

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.110 
this example he's turned the card around
and<00:04:28.590> he's<00:04:29.590> looked<00:04:30.070> at<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.700> he<00:04:30.790> sees<00:04:31.090> that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
and he's looked at it and he sees that

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.510 
and he's looked at it and he sees that
it's<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.450> nine<00:04:31.630> of<00:04:31.660> clubs<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.190> need<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.400> be

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
it's the nine of clubs so you need to be

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.550 
it's the nine of clubs so you need to be
watching<00:04:33.760> whether<00:04:34.120> he<00:04:34.330> turns<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:34.750> or<00:04:34.840> not<00:04:35.080> to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
watching whether he turns it or not to

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.260 
watching whether he turns it or not to
deduce<00:04:36.010> whether<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.700> need<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.910> turn<00:04:37.090> your

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.090 
deduce whether you need to turn your
deck<00:04:37.540> torn<00:04:37.840> up<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:39.550> then<00:04:40.200> he<00:04:41.200> turned<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.950> we

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
deck torn up so then he turned it so we

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.100 
deck torn up so then he turned it so we
kept<00:04:42.370> our<00:04:42.550> debt<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.820> same<00:04:43.120> we<00:04:43.750> asked<00:04:43.930> him<00:04:44.020> to

kept our debt the same we asked him to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.400 
kept our debt the same we asked him to
put<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.470> back<00:04:44.560> in<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.660> within<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.900> cards

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
put it back in the within the cards

cards facing down a lot point him down

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.920 
cards facing down a lot point him down
like<00:05:30.729> that<00:05:30.910> but<00:05:31.120> his<00:05:31.270> is<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.450> only<00:05:31.570> car<00:05:31.750> that's

okay<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.349> it's<00:06:17.530> out<00:06:17.740> of

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
okay so it's out of

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.290 
okay so it's out of
these<00:06:19.640> cards<00:06:20.030> now<00:06:20.330> that<00:06:20.930> could<00:06:21.110> be<00:06:21.170> your<00:06:21.440> card

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
these cards now that could be your card

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.580 
these cards now that could be your card
you<00:06:23.300> show<00:06:23.750> him<00:06:25.030> could<00:06:26.030> be<00:06:26.180> that<00:06:26.330> one<00:06:26.590> and

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
you show him could be that one and

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.880 
you show him could be that one and
they're<00:06:27.800> definitely<00:06:28.070> not<00:06:28.310> that<00:06:29.200> yes<00:06:30.230> so<00:06:30.710> it's

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
they're definitely not that yes so it's

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.030 
they're definitely not that yes so it's
either<00:06:31.100> between<00:06:31.430> these<00:06:31.880> two<00:06:32.090> cards<00:06:33.040> showing

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
either between these two cards showing

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.640 
either between these two cards showing
the<00:06:34.190> seven<00:06:34.640> and<00:06:34.880> say<00:06:35.210> no<00:06:36.110> I<00:06:36.140> don't<00:06:36.320> think<00:06:36.440> it's

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
the seven and say no I don't think it's

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.040 
the seven and say no I don't think it's
that<00:06:36.680> was<00:06:37.430> your<00:06:37.580> card<00:06:37.820> the<00:06:37.970> nine<00:06:38.180> of<00:06:38.210> clubs<00:06:38.480> and

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
that was your card the nine of clubs and

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.810 
that was your card the nine of clubs and
