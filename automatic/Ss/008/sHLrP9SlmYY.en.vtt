00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 take out of the family 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.980

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.170
 is hollow this completely we are going to 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.750
 boil the pulp then of our 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.750
 fruit with 50 grams of sugar 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.640
 and we will put water to cover it 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.350
 a little 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.740
 We bring them to a boil, serving with the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.429
 water and the chocolate of 'rating' of 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.429
 lie 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.299
 to bain marie 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.940
 there is boiling the pulp 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.770
 and the chocolate is already completely 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.630
 melted so let's start to 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.680
 to assemble 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.140
 the chocolate 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.200
 here we have the hot chocolate 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.590
 with the hot chocolate we will fill 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.180
 the toy 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.599
 quickly because chocolate is 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.599
 cool 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.569
 very well we make the chocolate pass 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.440
 for all 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.980
 the toy 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.980
 look bastian 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.099
 we emptied the rocket 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.450
 and we are going to take the rocketeer to the fridge 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 until it hardens well once it has 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.340
 served 10-15 minutes 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.320
 for pulp will be very soft and what 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.940
 we are going to process a minipimer so that 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.940
 we look good with a smooth mash 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.510
 let's cook two more minutes to 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.209
 Remove excess water once 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.560
 boiled again I'm going to let it cool 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.360
 when done grace this cold know that 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.690
 With a knife you can remove the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.690
 borders 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.950
 the stuffing was cold enough 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.170
 so that he would not shout chocolate when 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.830
 we put him inside the chocolate then 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.310
 let's proceed to fill our 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.310
 huevones 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.120
 Now we're going to put this in 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.670
 the refrigerator or in the freezer by 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.590
 a while until it cools well 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.049
 Once this is cold it was already in 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.180
 the fridge for a good time are going to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.890
 freeze about 20 minutes we have 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.780
 chocolate that we never let it cool 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.260
 because we still always having 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.520
 bain marie and we will cover 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.520
 the top part 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.270
 well once the discomfort 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.800
 have cooled completely we are going to 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.169
 overflow 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.060
 but to dismantle them the best 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.860
 we can do is submerge the nine 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.789
 mind in a little hot water 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.020
 to take off from below we use the 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.259
 same water that we had for the bathroom 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.259
 Mary 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.530
 without touching 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.980
 of course the chocolate for about 510 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.980
 seconds 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.530
