the<00:00:26.220> biggest<00:00:26.519> challenge<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> write<00:00:27.330> about

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the biggest challenge is to write about

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.179 
the biggest challenge is to write about
two<00:00:27.840> different<00:00:27.990> viewpoints<00:00:28.380> without

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
two different viewpoints without

two different viewpoints without
contradicting<00:00:29.730> yourself<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.480> basic<00:00:31.470> rule<00:00:31.650> in

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
contradicting yourself a basic rule in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
contradicting yourself a basic rule in
logic<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.879> something<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.360> true<00:00:33.540> its

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
logic is that if something is true its

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.380 
logic is that if something is true its
exact<00:00:34.500> opposite<00:00:34.980> can't<00:00:35.250> also<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.579> true<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
exact opposite can't also be true at the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.960 
exact opposite can't also be true at the
same<00:00:36.420> time<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> called<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> law<00:00:38.699> of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
same time this is called the law of

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.810 
same time this is called the law of
non-contradiction<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:40.260> other<00:00:41.190> words<00:00:41.399> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
non-contradiction in other words you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.700 
non-contradiction in other words you
can't<00:00:42.089> argue<00:00:42.269> that<00:00:42.540> watching<00:00:43.110> TV<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> better

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
can't argue that watching TV is better

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
can't argue that watching TV is better
than<00:00:44.010> reading<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.269> say<00:00:45.540> immediately

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
than reading and then say immediately

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
than reading and then say immediately
afterwards<00:00:46.589> that<00:00:46.800> reading<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> better<00:00:47.610> than

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
afterwards that reading is better than

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.869 
afterwards that reading is better than
watching<00:00:48.059> TV<00:00:48.890> when<00:00:49.890> students<00:00:50.339> make<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> sort

watching TV when students make this sort

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.880 
watching TV when students make this sort
of<00:00:50.970> argument<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.780> usually<00:00:52.050> mean<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.680> say

that<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.579> parts<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.360> proposition<00:00:54.750> are

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that some parts of a proposition are

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
that some parts of a proposition are
true<00:00:55.290> while<00:00:55.769> other<00:00:56.040> parts<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> its<00:00:56.879> opposite

are also true parts of watching TV are

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.329 
are also true parts of watching TV are
good<00:01:00.839> but<00:01:01.409> there<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.619> different<00:01:02.010> kinds<00:01:02.280> of

good but there are different kinds of

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.910 
good but there are different kinds of
benefits<00:01:02.790> from<00:01:02.939> reading<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> trick<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> be

benefits from reading the trick is to be

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
benefits from reading the trick is to be
precise<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.670> arguments<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> your

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
transitions if you're careful you can

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.499 
transitions if you're careful you can
write<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.310> contradictory<00:01:11.909> viewpoints

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509
