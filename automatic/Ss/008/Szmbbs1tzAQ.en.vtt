pool here is actually our plug and we

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.410 
pool here is actually our plug and we
manufacture<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.829> timber<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:33.149> all

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
manufacture this out of timber it's all

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.610 
manufacture this out of timber it's all
handcrafted<00:00:34.050> by<00:00:34.800> very<00:00:35.309> experienced

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
handcrafted by very experienced

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
handcrafted by very experienced
craftsmen<00:00:37.699> we<00:00:38.699> built<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.449> structure<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:39.960> of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
craftsmen we built the structure out of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.280 
craftsmen we built the structure out of
timber<00:00:40.650> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.699> then<00:00:41.940> spray<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.720> material

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
timber and then we then spray a material

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040 
timber and then we then spray a material
over<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:44.100> sand<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.879> buff<00:00:45.150> it<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.900> get

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
over it we sand it we buff it and we get

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
over it we sand it we buff it and we get
it<00:00:46.199> back<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.620> beautiful<00:00:47.220> shiny<00:00:47.519> finish

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it back to this beautiful shiny finish

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.660 
it back to this beautiful shiny finish
our<00:00:48.500> next<00:00:49.500> step<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.949> we'll<00:00:50.129> actually<00:00:50.339> then

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
our next step is we'll actually then

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.179 
our next step is we'll actually then
build<00:00:50.970> inside<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.659> mold<00:00:52.049> so<00:00:53.010> we'll

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:53.189 
build inside of this a mold so we'll

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:55.820 
build inside of this a mold so we'll
spray<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.939> our<00:00:54.269> mold<00:00:54.900> making<00:00:55.140> material

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
spray down out our mold making material

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.640 
spray down out our mold making material
will<00:00:56.460> build<00:00:56.670> our<00:00:56.850> steel<00:00:57.299> superstructure<00:00:58.290> and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
will build our steel superstructure and

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.460 
will build our steel superstructure and
we'll<00:00:59.250> take<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.670> mold<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.299> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.869> plug<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
we'll take that mold out of the plug and

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.299 
we'll take that mold out of the plug and
we<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> reverse<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.799> next<00:01:05.070> step

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
we get the reverse of this the next step

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
we get the reverse of this the next step
is<00:01:05.489> obviously<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.630> our

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is obviously we put that into our

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
is obviously we put that into our
manufacturing<00:01:07.500> process<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.009> we<00:01:08.340> build<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
manufacturing process and we build a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
manufacturing process and we build a
product<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> mold<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.619> take

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
product on the mold and when we take

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.550 
product on the mold and when we take
that<00:01:11.040> product<00:01:11.460> off<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.240> mold<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that product off the mold we get this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
that product off the mold we get this
back<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> completed<00:01:15.119> fiberglass

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
back but as a completed fiberglass

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
back but as a completed fiberglass
removal<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.420> our<00:01:18.659> process

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
removal so that's how that's our process

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
removal so that's how that's our process

a second as we walk our way down this
pool<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.650> can<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.489> have<00:02:24.940> built<00:02:25.299> into

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
pool you can see that we have built into

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.460 
pool you can see that we have built into
the<00:02:25.750> side<00:02:26.019> wall<00:02:26.049> a<00:02:27.000> safety<00:02:28.000> legend<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.319> this

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the side wall a safety legend we do this

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.789 
the side wall a safety legend we do this
for<00:02:29.680> two<00:02:29.830> reasons<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.489> first<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:32.470> great

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
for two reasons the first is it's great

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.430 
for two reasons the first is it's great
for<00:02:33.010> kids<00:02:33.580> kids<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.480> swim<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.230> they

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
for kids kids can swim up to that they

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.470 
for kids kids can swim up to that they
can<00:02:35.620> grab<00:02:35.799> onto<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.100> side<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.549> pool<00:02:36.730> they

can grab onto the side of the pool they

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.170 
can grab onto the side of the pool they
put<00:02:37.720> their<00:02:37.950> feet<00:02:38.950> there<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.489> they<00:02:39.819> can<00:02:40.000> use

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
put their feet there and they can use

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.820 
put their feet there and they can use
that<00:02:40.360> as<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> step<00:02:40.930> out<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.350> get<00:02:41.500> out<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.769> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
that as a step out to get out of the

pool
the<00:02:43.060> second<00:02:43.480> major<00:02:43.630> advantage<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.380> every<00:02:44.920> time

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
the second major advantage is every time

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.819 
the second major advantage is every time
we've<00:02:45.400> been<00:02:45.610> fiberglass<00:02:46.329> we<00:02:46.989> create<00:02:47.320> enormous

to the exit step and hop out of the pool
we've<00:03:19.909> done<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.209> same<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.140> other<00:03:21.170> side<00:03:21.530> of

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
we've done the same on the other side of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.130 
we've done the same on the other side of
the<00:03:21.739> pool<00:03:21.890> again<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.640> bench<00:03:22.879> and<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.870> step

the pool again the bench and the step
out<00:03:24.519> we've<00:03:25.519> kept<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.120> uniform<00:03:26.629> like<00:03:26.870> that

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
out we've kept it uniform like that

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.990 
out we've kept it uniform like that
because<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.590> then<00:03:27.709> means<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.580> homeowner

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
because it then means that the homeowner

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.539 
because it then means that the homeowner
can<00:03:29.629> have<00:03:29.840> their<00:03:30.019> house<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:31.040> side<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.340> the

football pool that side of the pool that
side<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.329> pool<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.780> there's<00:03:36.079> an<00:03:36.200> easy

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
side of the pool and there's an easy

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.729 
side of the pool and there's an easy
entry<00:03:36.860> exit<00:03:37.280> point<00:03:37.930> close<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.170> where<00:03:39.349> you're

this<00:03:42.170> pool<00:03:42.410> is<00:03:42.470> quite<00:03:42.859> a<00:03:42.890> deep<00:03:43.220> pool<00:03:43.489> I'm<00:03:44.500> just

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
this pool is quite a deep pool I'm just

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.979 
this pool is quite a deep pool I'm just
on<00:03:45.620> six<00:03:45.859> point<00:03:46.099> three<00:03:46.129> and<00:03:46.609> you<00:03:47.390> can<00:03:47.420> see<00:03:47.780> that

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
on six point three and you can see that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.539 
on six point three and you can see that
we're<00:03:48.170> roughly<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:48.620> about<00:03:48.769> seven<00:03:49.190> foot<00:03:49.370> in

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
we're roughly got about seven foot in

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.720 
we're roughly got about seven foot in
height<00:03:50.049> now<00:03:51.049> when<00:03:51.440> we<00:03:51.560> go<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.709> build<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.129> 35

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
height now when we go to build the 35

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.880 
height now when we go to build the 35
foot<00:03:52.760> version<00:03:53.390> it's<00:03:53.510> pool<00:03:53.810> we<00:03:54.470> basically

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
foot version it's pool we basically

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.640 
foot version it's pool we basically
bring<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.430> ball<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.599> we<00:03:56.720> get<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> 35<00:03:57.260> foot

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
bring this ball in and we get a 35 foot

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.589 
bring this ball in and we get a 35 foot
version<00:03:57.920> there<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:59.090> would<00:03:59.239> be<00:03:59.359> about

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
version there and that would be about

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.559 
version there and that would be about
six<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.109> a<00:04:00.200> half<00:04:00.230> foot<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:00.799> depth

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
six and a half foot in depth

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.059 
six and a half foot in depth
and<00:04:01.719> then<00:04:01.900> when<00:04:02.079> we<00:04:02.170> go<00:04:02.290> into<00:04:02.409> the<00:04:02.590> 30-foot

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
and then when we go into the 30-foot

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.610 
and then when we go into the 30-foot
version<00:04:03.610> will<00:04:04.360> be<00:04:04.390> roughly<00:04:04.810> about<00:04:04.989> six<00:04:05.409> foot

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
version will be roughly about six foot

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.429 
version will be roughly about six foot
in<00:04:05.769> depth<00:04:06.010> now<00:04:07.000> every<00:04:07.629> time<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.900> move<00:04:08.260> that

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
in depth now every time we move that

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.309 
in depth now every time we move that
Ollie<00:04:08.739> will<00:04:09.430> be<00:04:09.579> moving<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.750> section<00:04:11.200> as

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
Ollie will be moving this section as

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.470 
Ollie will be moving this section as
well<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:11.859> it<00:04:12.099> will<00:04:12.219> be<00:04:12.310> consistent<00:04:12.760> between

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
well so it will be consistent between

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.999 
well so it will be consistent between
all<00:04:13.780> three<00:04:14.079> models<00:04:14.500> as<00:04:15.479> we<00:04:16.479> move<00:04:16.690> back<00:04:16.930> up<00:04:17.139> pool

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
all three models as we move back up pool
