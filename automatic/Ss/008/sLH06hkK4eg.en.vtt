00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 part of the human body formed by 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.500
 water and so the cells 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.990
 directly in these sodium stations 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.840
 for example in the interior there are 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.940
 safeguards cellular organelles body 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.590
 which are also immersed in a liquid 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.140
 the cell of our body possesses 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 involving a skin or called a layer 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.269
 This membrane is 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.730
 responsibilities are among many 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.560
 the protection of the creation of the possibility 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.920
 of a chemical composition inside the sky 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.510
 and the other abroad bringing 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 individuality of cells as well as 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.059
 great essential agent for various 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.780
 Functions a fucking ong himself 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 barÃ©a then the cell membrane it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.190
 formed by two layers of lipids or 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 whether they are not soluble in water 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.640
 all those of pizzi they can be 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.789
 called the membrane's own benefits 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.899
 like steroid lipids that also act 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.270
 as hormones 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.520
 composition may change depending on the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.970
 type of the cell and also in the organism 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.790
 such as the age and health of the being 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 I live in plants and bacteria 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.700
 the composition will change from the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 environment of light and also of temperature 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.570
 in plant cells the cell membrane 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 she is different to mobile 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 already in the membranes animals 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.619
 constituting in photos and videos 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.920
 they were do videos and is also single 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.020
 girls all the lipids forming the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 membrane goes in if it in rows that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.970
 two layers, what will you do with 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.799
 that carbonic chains 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.439
 row in the front 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.990
 and in the middle of the layer 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.470
 lipid we can still notice 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 the other proteins that perform tasks 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.850
 maintenance of sodium and potassium and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.520
 also the transportation of water from other 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.409
 sibling 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.270
 is responsible for the input control and 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.909
 out of cell substances 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.590
 therefore it has a permeability 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.500
 by choosing who can enter or 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.390
 not the proteins present reminding that 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.700
 allow the passage of certain 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.739
 elements for saul giving its cell 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.410
 to communicate as external 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.510
 these so-called permeable proteins 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.760
 different formats for 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.739
 different and I have the functions 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 the protein that act as the channel 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.000
 allowing the passage of molecules with 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.569
 water ions and up to a certain size 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.430
 may be related to other proteins that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.680
 molecules from the external environment of the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.970
 that facilitate entry and exit 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.040
 the same 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.140
 there are also proteins that are 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.060
 recognition of structures of one or 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.220
 of the cells and require a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.870
 fit the cell with protein so that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.480
 interact with each other 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.209
 in other cases there are also proteins 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.640
 that when receiving certain 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.209
 molecules trigger some people 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.209
 inside the room 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.030
 on the transport of the substance between the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 cell and mail can give two ways 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.079
 active transport ride transportation 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.690
 basically the difference between the two is 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.880
 that in the passive to carry out the action 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.700
 I took energy while natives 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.530
 uses the active transport are divided 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.100
 in three cases merger broadcast center 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.480
 facilitate simple melt osmosis 11 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.819
 years can pass between spaces 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.019
 of the lipid layer, the growth in 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.510
 molecules to be small enough 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.030
 to be able to pass or for some 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.019
 channels of some fan patents 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.239
 facilitated 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.590
 the years passed to the cell through 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.560
 protein loaders 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.269
 instead of going through space in the 9 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.130
 occurs when there is a difference in 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.299
 concentration between water and cell 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.310
 water in the middle 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.989
 water has a natural tendency to pass 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.150
 least concentrated for the 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.549
 consulted 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.769
 already active transport are used and 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.720
 those found in the medium such as sodium 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.760
 potassium calcium iron and hydrogen in 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.139
 the majority of the minors who are 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.799
 used as fuel for the 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.799
 transfer 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.260
 The end with cell phone is with a lot of process 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.780
 who runs in a wild jungle in the profile of 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.790
 production and the following four 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.390
 phases 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.299
 The beginning of the book is unthinkable. 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.070
 period of greatest metabolic action and is 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.920
 when it also occurs in order to see and 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.010
 duplication and the return to rise both 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.250
 new cell knows whether it divides into 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.300
 period of opposition period nor 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 I saw a protein from being the theme of rma a fao 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.730
 the size increase right now 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:43.350
 period end period had production 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:46.080
 n to at the similar g2 was a 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.880
 that the only difference is that neither 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.870
 dna is already well adapted with this port 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.270
 the swim 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.100
 So let's talk about the victory. 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.100
 this time the future are doubled 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.230
 the friendly also happens by voices 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.020
 purpose here I chromatin starts if 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.120
 condense center use go away 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.450
 to the poles creating fibers and the membrane 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.640
 disappears along with the nuclei 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.370
 goal phase is available to the 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.830
 chromosomes in the center of the sky chromosomes 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.550
 the fibers of the spindle are joined by 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.480
 middle of the center - and then the study 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.360
 of the karyotype to new here occurs the 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.610
 fiber separation shortens in 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.410
 to the poles taking part of the chromosomes 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.640
 which become a chromosome 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.860
 independently 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.480
 this time with the division into 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.490
 to give the chromosomes telote phase 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.620
 here the chromosomes are already together 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.470
 between us ressurge nuclear membrane 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.800
 nucleus, the division itself is called 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.390
 tony cytokine sesi 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.200
 after that process the inter phase 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.200
 occurs again
