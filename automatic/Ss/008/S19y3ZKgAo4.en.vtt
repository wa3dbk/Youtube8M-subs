00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.429
 yeah do not blame so much but the waters 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 ok so now because the different 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.030
 zipline in the handle of the can 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.710
 we will serve one and the four to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 sufficient distance for easter to sabine 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.129
 so we have three identical systems 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 hooked to the same boil that we 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.350
 allow to hang three bags of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.579
 different conservation opportunity to have 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 a departure and while he is in the process 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.250
 to fight I'm showing you alas 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.729
 system hangs from the bag conservation 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.110
 so first step with one of 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.760
 ends of the wires that passes into the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.360
 can I made a solid bone on my 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.220
 storage bag and with each other 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.490
 end I'm going to do it gently 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 backstage and the rope so 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.689
 she takes the bag away 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.040
 enough for the fish to get dressed 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:22.170
 not here I pull gently as one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.470
 can see it backstage the map 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.470
 advanced 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.770
 here it is at half water level 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.200
 there I am sure that not to spoil for 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 finalize the operation so I have the rope 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 which is connected to my storage bag 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.909
 and the other one that allows me to do 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 slide cling both ground 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.179
 and here is the map is safe 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.709
 our second card price for that have 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.600
 explained the technique 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.479
 so I will show with this map 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.549
 simply just shoot on 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.950
 one of two ends of the double 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.119
 official that we installed and keep 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.429
 the hand the string of the bag of 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.860
 preservation of origin we can see the 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.459
 card is fine can you see 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 gently because with blow inertia 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.450
 necessarily there is a tension all 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.450
 is established 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.230
 here is enough to go slowly and 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.230
 the card 120 da the can 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.930
 and as we can see she is 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.930
 kept mid-water 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.159
 damn it's a beautiful cold I 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.159
 found there it's pure happiness
