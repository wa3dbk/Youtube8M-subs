00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.000
 in today's national complex e 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.220
 held in Rome by the ion yes it is 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.179
 talked about professional companies either 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.259
 a new form of exercise 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.480
 dental activity of the 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.600
 professional activities in general that he has 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.360
 certainly innovative aspects either 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.270
 can take advantage of legal forms already 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.580
 present in our system which ad 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.800
 example corporations and corporations 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.750
 cooperatives 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 but having a strong focus on 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.570
 pathology and respect for the category 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 of the characteristics in the profession 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.920
 as two thirds of the members e 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 of the administrative body must 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.420
 however refer to 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 so professionals can finally 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.640
 insert a combination of a non-activity 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.300
 professional with an activity 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.560
 professional while having clearly 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.520
 the importance that every performance 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.360
 professional is only performed by 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.460
 professional in this case 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.070
 from the dentist this is a first 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.350
 second interest aspect could 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.310
 be the one to involve 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.130
 in their own company among professionals 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.009
 close family members or individuals who have 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.080
 maybe a financial availability 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.880
 important to be able to favor certain 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 investment in professional activity 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.830
 and in the dental activity that always 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.020
 more are interesting 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.049
 comparing the advantages 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.030
 disadvantages for example one of the most 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.170
 common forms of exercise of the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.170
 profession is the association 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.130
 professional for which associate from 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.690
 management cost point of view 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.729
 perhaps this associated with it 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 even more convenient as it does not 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.319
 assumes if the choice towards that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.600
 of the capital company the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.990
 Presentation of a budget is a series 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.060
 of necessary bureaucratic obligations 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.060
 however from a tax point of view 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 to date, though not yet having a clear one 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.190
 definition in which the treatment will be 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.140
 tax of the company between 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.100
 professionals via a bill 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.280
 who had to assimilate the sociatà 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.560
 treatment professionals 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.500
 of the associated study is income 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 self-employed professional who has 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.360
 as everyone knows a tax 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.690
 therefore progressive with the growth of 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.220
 income that also imposes taxation 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.540
 same treatment from the point of view 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.630
 of the formation of the contributions 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.709
 contributive therefore from the point of view is 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.420
 as well as income 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.670
 of the professional association but also 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.090
 that of the professional company will be 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.560
 subject to the contribution is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.840
 different than the companies of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.570
 massarelli capital so-called centers e 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.360
 mental with dental clinics and both 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:01.340
 in primis the tax treatment 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.870
 so the year dental centers are the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.660
 companies of companies that have given me 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.380
 the proportional rate is 27 e 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.090
 half 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.680
 in any case then we know that the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.610
 income has been reduced that the reggio is 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.560
 much more relevant and differences e 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.420
 tranquility in the area of ​​contributions in 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.849
 sense that it is recently 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.400
 parma considered amenable 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.260
 through an article 3 of the regulation 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.610
 of the grass also the income deriving from 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.239
 activities conducted and raw spa 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.530
 if referring to an activity 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.989
 therefore more safety 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.360
 from the point of view of the legislation for 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.100
 the society among waiting professionals 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.100
 of a clear classification of taxes
