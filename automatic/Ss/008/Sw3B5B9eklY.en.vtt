00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:11.809
 well here we have our greca let's 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:16.250
 need coffee to make Cuban coffee 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.939
 or express it is very important to use coffee 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.820
 ground espresso ok can not be used in 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.400
 another type of coffee because then there is no 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.400
 the idea of an espresso was expressed 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.450
 It's a strong coffee and to keep it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.550
 this consistency and with this flavor that 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.610
 distinguishes in a good espresso coffee is 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.280
 important to use the indicated coffee is coffee 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.930
 espresso ground good here we have 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 our adds that it is divided into three 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.230
 parts in case you do not know it this is the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.840
 valve here brings the filter here is 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.809
 where you put the coffee and the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.060
 ingredients are under the box 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:01.240
 of the video is all the indication 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.820
 of how to do it and for the amount of 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.820
 everything to give everything 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.390
 everything is well expressed that way 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.740
 important 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 we put the top part 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 and my stove is preheating pse 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 the small burner so that this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.939
 start 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.440
 to prepare immediately is important 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.410
 that is tight 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.620
 because this is cooked at good pressure already 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.360
 I'm going to put it 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.870
 to cook my coffee now this is sugar 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.240
 they are going to need sugar it is important that 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.890
 use white sugar I never have 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.180
 made with good sugar to make is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:56.050
 I need never Cuban coffee I've never 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.170
 made with brown sugar because 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.730
 for consistency that is something that 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.520
 I'm going to show now how it's going to be done 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.140
 when I'm a little bit of coffee it 's 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 important to use white sugar 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.500
 Of course, if what you want is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.150
 have a cup of coffee and throw him 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.209
 brown sugar will be what you want 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.950
 perfect but in the idea of â€‹â€‹this video 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.940
 It's like preparing a Cuban coffee then 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.940
 this is what they will need 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.310
 and here is this is the consistency that 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:34.270
 They want to see what a good paste that is 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.030
 is what we are playing 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.870
 excuse the camera angle this is 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.480
 what we are looking for that consistency 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.130
 that is like a pasta have to follow 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.540
 moving mixing until there is a 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.540
 little bit softer this like a 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.960
 candy are being formed practically 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.990
 but this what gives that foam that 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.240
 is above that is why it 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.810
 distinguishes not in espresso at home 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.220
 of Cuban walking and my house 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.220
 remove it from the game 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.140
 now this is the cup where I am going to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.140
 to serve 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.950
 if you're not where I'm going to serve my coffee to 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.270
 I'm going to add a spoonful of 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.690
 this mixture 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.690
 down and Cuban coffee in coffee well 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.940
 sweet to not this is not to sleep of 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.940
 this is to wake up is not the idea 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.490
 now we add our coffee here 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.490
 and we add here 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.010
 Y 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.010
 and here they have it 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.420
 this is a Cuban coffee then how do you 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.090
 I explained the idea is to form that foam 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.000
 who see above that is what makes a 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.490
 delicious coffee play an espresso 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.880
 I hope this recipe has been 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.860
 found I do not know 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.440
 good that it is something that they want to prepare 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.590
 because if they have traveled to Miami at some time 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.910
 or to the same Cuba and have tasted a coffee 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.670
 Cuban, I'm sure they've been 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.890
 delighted because it's a well-known coffee 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.480
 in Miami and if they miss him, as much as 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.060
 It is better to prepare it in your home 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.010
 which is super easy to prepare alone 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.540
 requires a few steps I hope that 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.570
 this video has been useful for something 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.610
 so they can prepare this recipe 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.470
 delicious and below are all 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.480
 ingredients and how much you need 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.920
 until the next thanks for watching 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.920
 Latin kitchen chao 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.060
