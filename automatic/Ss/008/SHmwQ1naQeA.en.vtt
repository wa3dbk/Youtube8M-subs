not exciting gameplay I agree um we need
I<00:02:02.149> mean<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.479> problem<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.259> if<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.500> go<00:02:03.649> play

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
I mean the problem is is if you go play

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.249 
I mean the problem is is if you go play
killing<00:02:04.250> for<00:02:04.430> one<00:02:04.820> circle<00:02:05.420> strafing<00:02:05.689> wasn't<00:02:06.200> a

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
killing for one circle strafing wasn't a

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.060 
killing for one circle strafing wasn't a
thing<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.360> way<00:02:08.540> I<00:02:08.570> think<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.200> game<00:02:09.440> made

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
thing and in a way I think the game made

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.949 
thing and in a way I think the game made
you<00:02:10.250> rely<00:02:10.549> on<00:02:10.579> your<00:02:10.820> teammates<00:02:11.269> firepower

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
you rely on your teammates firepower

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.920 
you rely on your teammates firepower

this<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.799> general<00:02:19.519> I'm<00:02:20.030> sorry<00:02:20.299> we're

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
this is in general I'm sorry we're

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.420 
this is in general I'm sorry we're
finding<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:21.079> in<00:02:21.290> general<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.890> make<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.190> more

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
finding this in general to make it more

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.620 
finding this in general to make it more
obviously<00:02:23.330> skill<00:02:23.720> based<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.230> exciting<00:02:24.830> so

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
obviously skill based and exciting so

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.600 
obviously skill based and exciting so
I<00:02:26.690> guess<00:02:27.560> they're<00:02:27.770> trying<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.190> tweak<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
I guess they're trying to tweak the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.750 
I guess they're trying to tweak the
bosses<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.770> maybe<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.160> makes<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.550> more

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
bosses so that it maybe it makes it more

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.100 
bosses so that it maybe it makes it more
of<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:33.440> skill<00:02:34.340> based<00:02:34.610> engagement<00:02:35.480> rather<00:02:35.720> than

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
of a skill based engagement rather than

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.040 
of a skill based engagement rather than
just<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.880> what<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.150> which<00:02:38.810> is

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
just kind of what it is now which is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.260 
just kind of what it is now which is
sort<00:02:39.320> of<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.710> hammering<00:02:40.490> away<00:02:40.700> at<00:02:41.000> health

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270

daily<00:04:41.220> updates<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:42.180> would<00:04:42.360> just<00:04:42.539> confuse

daily updates that would just confuse
the<00:04:43.080> feedback<00:04:43.470> even<00:04:43.680> more<00:04:43.979> we're<00:04:44.550> looking<00:04:44.759> at

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
the feedback even more we're looking at

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.270 
the feedback even more we're looking at

feedback and planning out coherent

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.210 
feedback and planning out coherent
solutions<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.530> takes<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.770> bit<00:04:52.919> longer<00:04:52.949> to

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
solutions so it takes a bit longer to

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.510 
solutions so it takes a bit longer to
plan<00:04:53.490> code<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.090> test<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.770> am<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:56.039> ok<00:04:56.490> with

plan code and test I am actually ok with

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.629 
plan code and test I am actually ok with
this<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:57.060> kind<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:58.020> am<00:04:58.199> in<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.530> camp<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.370> know

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
this I kind of am in the camp of I know

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.219 
this I kind of am in the camp of I know
a<00:04:59.759> lot<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.060> guys<00:05:00.210> are<00:05:00.419> getting<00:05:00.570> pissed<00:05:00.840> at<00:05:01.080> the

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
a lot of guys are getting pissed at the

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.350 
a lot of guys are getting pissed at the
game<00:05:01.380> for<00:05:01.650> not<00:05:01.770> having<00:05:02.009> like<00:05:02.130> very<00:05:02.430> frequent

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
game for not having like very frequent

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.439 
game for not having like very frequent
updates<00:05:03.539> but<00:05:04.229> I<00:05:04.520> think<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.639> end<00:05:05.820> result<00:05:06.120> is

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
updates but I think the end result is

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.390 
updates but I think the end result is
more<00:05:06.690> important<00:05:07.259> than<00:05:07.860> what<00:05:08.009> we<00:05:08.039> have<00:05:08.370> right

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
more important than what we have right

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.480 
more important than what we have right
here<00:05:08.880> right<00:05:09.150> now<00:05:09.360> as<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:11.009> an<00:05:11.160> early

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
like it's it's not worth playing in my

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.749 
like it's it's not worth playing in my
opinion<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.650> mean<00:05:37.680> you're<00:05:38.009> not<00:05:38.160> getting

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
opinion I mean you're not getting

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.460

anything out of that class the only

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.230 
anything out of that class the only
advantage<00:05:41.039> I've<00:05:41.400> heard<00:05:41.699> and<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.000> haven't<00:05:42.150> even

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
advantage I've heard and I haven't even

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.960 
advantage I've heard and I haven't even
tried<00:05:42.599> this<00:05:42.960> is<00:05:43.229> if<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.889> throw<00:05:44.099> a<00:05:44.130> zerk

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
tried this is if you throw a zerk

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.790 
tried this is if you throw a zerk
grenade<00:05:45.479> while<00:05:45.930> your<00:05:46.110> teammates<00:05:46.470> getting

grenade while your teammates getting

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.980 
grenade while your teammates getting
like<00:05:46.979> drained<00:05:47.280> when<00:05:47.639> Hans<00:05:47.880> grabs<00:05:48.270> them<00:05:48.510> it'll

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
like drained when Hans grabs them it'll

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.839 
like drained when Hans grabs them it'll
actually<00:05:49.169> get<00:05:49.500> them<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:49.740> let<00:05:49.889> go<00:05:49.919> that's<00:05:50.639> the

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
actually get them to let go that's the

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.490 
actually get them to let go that's the
only<00:05:51.270> thing<00:05:51.479> that<00:05:51.720> makes<00:05:51.870> them<00:05:52.080> like<00:05:52.229> the

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
only thing that makes them like the
