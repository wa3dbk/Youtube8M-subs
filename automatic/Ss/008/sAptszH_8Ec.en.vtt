00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 everyone i 'm coming back today 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.670
 with a new makeup tutorial that I 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.250
 realized with the year that 3 is the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.660
 earlier than I wear in my video of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.120
 luxury at low prices you have it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.530
 hugely asked to listen to you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.530
 interest I invite you to stay there 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.470
 first I apply a base so if you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.930
 have a cricket violate a place 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 violet I took what you have that 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 simply allow me to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 to make pop and the colors that I come 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.060
 so blurred with my fingers and here 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 uses aulika pencil aulika in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.340
 reaching 16 anyway I will put 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.380
 all in serious information then I 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.570
 take the shade younger limit y 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.059
 rappliquer I believe with an e 45 from 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.370
 sigma in the hollow of the eye so that's 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 a precision brush and his father whom he 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100
 is really practical practice for its 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.719
 part of which so I decided to apply 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.879
 the basis of milk simply because 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 I like to come on dark side 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230
 half of the eyelid and like 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.530
 you can see that it gives a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.239
 little greyish purple color that is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 very very nice it allows to change a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.780
 little tones that can be found 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.159
 in the palette then on the other 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.290
 half of the cars and I apply 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.750
 tricks and factory so that will bring 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 a small bronze color so here I 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.070
 apply it with a pencil brush 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.900
 at mac and that I come dimmed with a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.180
 small precision always at home 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 sigma and so here I go back a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.460
 little bit of lovers and that's it I leave 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 to deceive afterwards but know that 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 I applied these same hues twice 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.689
 can see the easy intensity then 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.579
 in the mucosa I always apply the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.130
 even furrow in olic to olic therefore 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.780
 the young light waterproof eyeliner is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 in target harbor and I apply everything 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.299
 just a little darkseid and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.610
 blackburn 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.870
 here to call the eyelid mobile 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.940
 superior 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.460
 then in the inner corner I apply so 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.400
 tests that I accented with fixed 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.420
 plus the story here that's who's the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.100
 color comes out perfectly I do not you 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.900
 the more presents I apply as 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.420
 usually but darling mascara so 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:22.840
 this is the volume of Chanel and the one 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 of many Roma in terms of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.140
 thyme personally when I'm doing 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 loaded makeups I prefer to do the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.130
 pessan bread avoids repeating twice 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.260
 the same thing so here i use the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.630
 concile hours to camouflage pygmies 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.490
 redness and its 56 at the one at 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.690
 mascara which is very very good by 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.370
 against as you can see he has 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.210
 tendency to oxidize in need to work 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.210
 very quickly 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.340
 and behind I will therefore apply the same 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.250
 amount of that hamas break the stim 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:03:00.489
 drop foundation so the same who is 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:03:02.560
 very very well once I applied 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.760
 the foundation I want to come stung 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.130
 my powder with movements 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.660
 circular story to smooth the skin 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.890
 and then I apply a little bit of 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.890
 brother to warm up the amount 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.200
 it's gone faceted and filmed but 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.140
 I applied a little lipstick to 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400
 at pereira gently sloping people no 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.860
 applied lightly to my lips and 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.510
 then I just chatted with the roof and 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.880
 so that's the result had farted 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.460
