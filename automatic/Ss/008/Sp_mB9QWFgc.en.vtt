00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.670
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.860
 of trailer in Rio Puntocom I am several 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.519
 introduced the new house fire 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.960
 art leaks the fire 2014 who violates 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.660
 and had the opportunity to try the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.580
 previous edition maybe find missing 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.290
 something more good elasticity then in 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.239
 this garment we will discover the 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.910
 again but you will see that they have incorporated 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.430
 more elastic parts with less parts 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.750
 Elastic first construction 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.759
 completely nylon according everything 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.590
 that we have here is 100% nylon so 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.140
 It is a construction that will give us 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.000
 rigidity and that also incorporates repair 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.400
 Stop see if the camera catches it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.780
 are those little squares that what 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.350
 it guarantees us is that if we get hooked 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.150
 with some branch with some stone 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.730
 will break only that square and not 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.820
 will tear the garment completely 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.430
 sleeves I turn it on earlier also what 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.110
 I was wearing more protection for the part 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.880
 superior a little longer here in the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.890
 top part to protect us and the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.339
 elastic band at the bottom like this 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.420
 that the contour of the hand follows 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.490
 reflective on this side just like in 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.130
 the other sleeve we also have 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.909
 reflective in the chest and I take advantage of you 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.229
 I teach 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.890
 before here in the back 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.780
 taking advantage of that it is of backs 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.880
 it was also taught a little wider in 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.829
 the whole back part of here 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.780
 to give us more freedom of movement 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.859
 since nylon itself is not 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.359
 especially elastic and it's not going 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.939
 to give that freedom of movement in 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.950
 I change the polyester and this is what 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.259
 incorporates novelty here in the armpit to 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.849
 all this part of here all this what 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.950
 will do is favor much more the 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.539
 perspiration favor much more the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.090
 expulsion of sweat and it is also an area 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.319
 in which while we run we are not usually 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.069
 give the air and it's enough 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.719
 protected also construction all 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.879
 seams on the inside 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.429
 trying to avoid chafing and that in 

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:57.439
 the back here is somewhat longer 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.929
 that up front for when we're 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.530
 in rises favor that we do not run out 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.479
 going up and we end up entering the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.369
 wind and cold around here to be able 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.290
 close a windbreaker we have here alone 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.450
 fix a small carabiner with a 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.010
 cordino and is that what this looks for 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
 really this garment is that it is very 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.940
 light and that is a garment 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.310
 of 105 grams is also incorporated 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.360
 pocket on the side with zipper 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.580
 fix pocket where we fit the hand 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 also incorporates a small pocket 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.400
 inside a mesh and we have the hole 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.410
 to be able to take out the cables by the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.760
 inside and in this way prevent it from 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.099
 we can get hooked with the vegetation 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.959
 while we are running rack 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.000
 fix yourself very small car zipper 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.549
 also to lighten all the whole 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.260
 garment and with inner flange for 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.120
 avoid that the wind can be filtered through 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.160
 this part also all this when 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.160
 we go up land leaves us below the 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.110
 nut fix and avoid in this way that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.569
 we get between the wind here as you 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.050
 he said in addition to this the garment carries a 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.330
 treatment wr 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.400
 and this means that it is not 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.860
 waterproof but that if we go out and we 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.280
 take some rain worth going to be 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.180
 repellent fix how water repels and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.420
 do not stay on top of the garment 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.510
 it's worth how it runs around here it's worth and just 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.070
 four drops are left if we move it 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.380
 you will see that the garment has barely been 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.120
 moistened this means that if not 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.170
 it rains a lot we will be able to be 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.720
 Protected against drizzle or little or short 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.590
 short of rain then also this is 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.170
 a garment that has to be light 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.420
 that is already 105 grams but also this 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.870
 model incorporates the possibility to fix 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.819
 to be able to save it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.549
 in your pocket is here the pocket 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.640
 we had what we can take advantage of 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.580
 we turn 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.890
 and we keep all the garment in its 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.020
 interior incorporates the zipper also 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.069
 on this side so 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:11.159
 we just closed with the zipper 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.489
 fix and we have in this little 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.620
 saved space our fire 2014 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.090
 this is the proposal also with shooter 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.579
 to be able to hang it to take it 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.470
 hung if we want in some belt or 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.699
 grabbed inside the backpack this is the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.680
 proposal I turn it on 2014 model of 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.630
