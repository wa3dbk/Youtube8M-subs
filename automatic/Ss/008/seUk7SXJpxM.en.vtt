00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.520
It is a half past may and we are at River Kivijoki in UtajÃ¤rvi.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.260
Flood is high, really high.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.480
Normally you can fish on the bank in the front of those bushes

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:32.100
This is just a test how fish catch a hook when river is flooding.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.320
Earlier we tested lures, but no fish found.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.560
There is a fish trap few hundred meters up stream. We have few small pikes and  perches there.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.660
Anyway, I just got a small roach so there is fish and it will catch hook.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.620
Ok. Lets try again. Now I am testing how deep the water is here.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.700
The easiest way to solve it is to change the hight of the float. And when the hook hits bottom -

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.180
you just move the float little closer to the hook.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.900
Look, it is a roach!

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
The second roach of the summer.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240
This is a little bit bigger.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.240
There are a lot of roaches in this river.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.140
In fact this fish is so small you have nothing to eat.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420
Now let me tell you about this hook and line.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.000
This basic hook and line lets you fish.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.520
But the problem with these super market sets is that there is usually too few weight.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.540
This is more sophisticated float which is little bit broken.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.600
But it doesn't matter what is the float like. It has to have enough weight under.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.000
If the float is too much visible it will be too much resistance for fish.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.420
It will immediately find out that there is something wrong.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.640
The less the float is on the surface the less a fish feels resistance.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.060
And fish will bee more daring to catch the bait.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.680
There were already two weights in this line.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.760
I couldn't take them off. So I put few more. The first few centimeters from the hook.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.380
Two more here and one upper here.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.080
The idea is that the hook will fall quickly to the depth we choose.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.380
An other subject is the bait.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.840
Some guides say that the hook tip should be visible.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.920
It is an everlasting issue should it be visible or not.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.080
The argument for the hook tip to left visible is that fish would catch easier.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.980
If I fish with a hook like this on these waters it is granted that I wouldn't get any fish.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.100
In this river the hook must be fully hidden in the bait.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.960
It will catch.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.140
You can test different types of baits.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.780
Sometimes you need just a small bit of bait. Sometimes the whole worm. And there are many styles.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.847
I have the traditional style.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.240
The hook won't be seen at all.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.000
If fish is eating and suddenly eating stops the hook is probably visible.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960
The first perch.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600
Excellent.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.960
We have at least ten same like in the fish trap. Now we can do the stew cock.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.620
Tried to resist.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.820
Imidiately we get fish when I lowered the hook near the bottom.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.460
This is allmost the size we could make filee.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.020
They say that about 20 centimeter roach is suitable for filee.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.320
By the way there is a pike bite!

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.800
Or a big perch. There are marks on both sides.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.820
Now we have proven that you can catch fish from a flooding water.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.600
These are not value fishes but I didn't come here to catch them anyway.
