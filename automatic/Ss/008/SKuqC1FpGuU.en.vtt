that<00:00:40.530> will<00:00:40.800> allow<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.610> move<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.300> camera

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629

this<00:00:43.620> thing<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.489> moves<00:00:44.760> around<00:00:45.030> all

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this thing that just moves around all

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.619 
this thing that just moves around all
over<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> specific<00:00:46.289> point<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.670> map<00:00:47.700> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
over to a specific point on the map in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
over to a specific point on the map in
this<00:00:48.870> case<00:00:49.140> we're<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.700> point

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
this case we're going to make that point

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.290 
this case we're going to make that point
right<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> CC<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.309> camera<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.910> hockey

that if I'm at some random location on

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.480 
that if I'm at some random location on
the<00:01:15.030> map<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.420> hit<00:01:15.630> f5<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.350> brings<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.100> camera

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
back here let's say I'm selecting this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
back here let's say I'm selecting this
SUV<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.850> over<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.180> again<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.479> hit<00:01:21.780> f5

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
SUV and I'm over here again I hit f5

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840 
SUV and I'm over here again I hit f5
brings<00:01:22.619> me<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:23.580> still

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
brings me back here and I'm still

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
brings me back here and I'm still
selecting<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> unit<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.619> very

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
selecting that unit that is very

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
selecting that unit that is very
important<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.479> were<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.659> try<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
important because if you were to try and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.240 
important because if you were to try and
move<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.259> camera<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.650> by<00:01:28.890> double<00:01:29.220> tapping

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
move the camera back by double tapping

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.440 
move the camera back by double tapping
your<00:01:29.700> CC<00:01:30.180> hockey<00:01:31.520> now<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> CC<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.090> hockey

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
your CC hockey now the CC is hockey

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
your CC hockey now the CC is hockey
dance<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.840> certainly<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> CC<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
dance or certainly now that CC is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.060 
dance or certainly now that CC is
selected<00:01:35.460> instead<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> SCV<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
selected instead of the SCV so this is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.700 
selected instead of the SCV so this is
very<00:01:38.340> important<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> number<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.299> reasons

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
very important for a number of reasons

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.700 
very important for a number of reasons
mainly<00:01:40.710> because<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.930> useful<00:01:43.500> for

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
mainly because it's just so useful for

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.600 
mainly because it's just so useful for
certain<00:01:44.009> things<00:01:44.869> one<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.610> building

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
certain things one of them is building

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.490 
certain things one of them is building
buildings<00:01:48.000> especially<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> Terran<00:01:49.350> player

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
buildings especially as a Terran player

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.410 
buildings especially as a Terran player
and<00:01:49.860> protoss<00:01:50.549> has<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> deal<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.270> as

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and protoss has to deal with this as

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230 
and protoss has to deal with this as
well<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.520> want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> build<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
well as you can see I want to build a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.950 
well as you can see I want to build a
supply<00:01:54.570> depot<00:01:54.710> right<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:56.210> but<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> go

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
supply depot right here but I want to go

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
supply depot right here but I want to go
mine<00:01:58.200> from<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.469> main<00:01:58.770> again<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.640> really

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
mine from my main again it's not really

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969 
mine from my main again it's not really
efficient<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> build<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.899> then<00:02:01.439> drag<00:02:01.829> your

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
efficient to build it and then drag your

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.340 
efficient to build it and then drag your
camera<00:02:02.280> back<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:02.939> reek<00:02:03.180> lick<00:02:03.450> no<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
camera back and then reek lick no I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
camera back and then reek lick no I
don't<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.009> instead<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.969> build<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
don't like that instead you can build it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.479 
don't like that instead you can build it
at<00:02:06.570> five<00:02:06.840> shift<00:02:07.320> click<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.799> look<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.429> how

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
at five shift click back look at how

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.990 
at five shift click back look at how
much<00:02:08.640> faster<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
much faster that is I just the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.370 
much faster that is I just the
applications<00:02:12.000> here<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.390> really<00:02:12.569> infinite

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
applications here are really infinite

camera<00:02:14.380> hockey's<00:02:14.770> are<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.190> essential<00:02:15.490> for

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
camera hockey's are so essential for

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.330 
camera hockey's are so essential for
many<00:02:16.360> things<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.710> can<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.070> i'm<00:02:18.190> just

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
many things as you can see i'm just

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.510 
many things as you can see i'm just
going<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.520> get<00:02:18.640> f6<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.660> my<00:02:20.230> natural<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.860> f7<00:02:21.190> on

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
going to get f6 on my natural and f7 on

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.940 
going to get f6 on my natural and f7 on
my<00:02:21.670> third<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.300> now<00:02:22.900> i<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.470> jump<00:02:23.770> between

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
my third and now i can just jump between

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.760 
my third and now i can just jump between
those<00:02:24.250> bases<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.060> easily<00:02:25.330> i<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.650> how

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
those bases so so easily i think of how

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.670 
those bases so so easily i think of how
easy<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> may<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:27.970> workers<00:02:28.450> look<00:02:29.050> just

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
easy it is to may not workers look just

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800 
easy it is to may not workers look just
select<00:02:29.950> what<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.130> want<00:02:30.220> f6<00:02:31.060> click<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
select what you want f6 click and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.450 
select what you want f6 click and
they're<00:02:32.110> transferred<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:32.770> easily<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.310> don't

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
they're transferred so easily you don't

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.250 
they're transferred so easily you don't
want<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.700> net<00:02:33.850> transferring<00:02:34.270> back<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
want the net transferring back the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.850 
want the net transferring back the
really<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.100> it's<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.210> good

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
really it's just it's so so good

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.230 
really it's just it's so so good

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
fast I think if you play with this

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.650 
fast I think if you play with this
you're<00:03:15.310> going<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.490> really<00:03:15.730> increase<00:03:15.970> your<00:03:16.210> APM

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
you're going to really increase your APM

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.500 
you're going to really increase your APM
and<00:03:17.050> that's<00:03:17.710> EA<00:03:18.040> p.m.<00:03:18.430> effective<00:03:18.940> APM<00:03:19.300> you're

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and that's EA p.m. effective APM you're

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.970 
and that's EA p.m. effective APM you're
going<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.690> be<00:03:19.780> doing<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.050> lot<00:03:20.080> more<00:03:20.260> actions<00:03:20.800> per

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
going to be doing a lot more actions per

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.070 
going to be doing a lot more actions per
minute<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.430> are<00:03:21.550> affected<00:03:22.240> going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.960> make

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
minute that are affected going to make

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.140 
minute that are affected going to make
more<00:03:23.290> use<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.500> your<00:03:23.710> speed<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:25.000> probably

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
more use of your speed and it's probably

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.700 
more use of your speed and it's probably
going<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.450> lead<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.660> better<00:03:25.840> gameplay<00:03:26.110> overall

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710
