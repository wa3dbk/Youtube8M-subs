00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
to go back and forth that's actually not

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.270 
to go back and forth that's actually not
good<00:02:07.659> for<00:02:07.840> suede<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.410> why<00:02:08.679> would<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:08.979> be<00:02:09.100> good

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
good for suede so why would it be good

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:23.940 
good for suede so why would it be good
to<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.239> here<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:13.030> go<00:02:13.180> one<00:02:13.390> direction

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.160 

doesn't<00:02:24.580> do<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.820> best<00:02:25.000> job<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.480> every<00:02:25.960> single

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
doesn't do the best job on every single

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.760 
doesn't do the best job on every single
scuff<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:26.920> actually<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.580> real<00:02:28.000> scuff<00:02:28.770> so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
scuff that's actually a real scuff so

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.080 
scuff that's actually a real scuff so
that's<00:02:29.950> going<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> little<00:02:30.460> harder<00:02:30.820> to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that's going to be a little harder to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.440 
that's going to be a little harder to
work<00:02:31.210> on<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.160> does<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.640> your<00:02:34.000> basic
