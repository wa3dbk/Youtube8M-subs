chapter<00:01:19.030> we<00:01:19.240> see<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:19.780> she<00:01:19.960> actually

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
chapter we see that she actually

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.760 
chapter we see that she actually
activates<00:01:20.980> bankai<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:23.230> sad<00:01:23.470> thing<00:01:23.500> about

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
activates bankai and the sad thing about

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.490 
activates bankai and the sad thing about
this<00:01:24.160> is<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.460> we<00:01:24.910> don't<00:01:25.030> really<00:01:25.390> know<00:01:25.930> what<00:01:26.290> a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
this is that we don't really know what a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.070 
this is that we don't really know what a
bankai<00:01:26.800> is<00:01:27.070> capable<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:27.970> now<00:01:28.510> this<00:01:28.870> can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
bankai is capable of now this can

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.100 
bankai is capable of now this can
possibly<00:01:29.740> be<00:01:30.340> due<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.480> fact<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.780> she<00:01:31.900> was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
possibly be due to the fact that she was

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.320 
possibly be due to the fact that she was
overpowered<00:01:32.740> by<00:01:32.740> kampachi<00:01:33.280> even<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.060> her

bankai state or maybe her bankai has an
ability<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.790> can<00:01:40.090> possibly<00:01:40.330> assist

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
ability that can possibly assist

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
of like I said before is a possibility

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.420

tend to die but kubo has been shown to

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.800 
tend to die but kubo has been shown to
actually<00:03:56.439> throw<00:03:56.889> away<00:03:57.189> his<00:03:57.759> past<00:03:58.180> habits<00:03:58.449> in

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
this art by itself so i really i really

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.509 
this art by itself so i really i really
can't<00:04:01.870> say<00:04:02.079> anything<00:04:02.319> for<00:04:03.069> that<00:04:03.189> she<00:04:03.370> can

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
can't say anything for that she can

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.939 
can't say anything for that she can
possibly<00:04:03.970> really<00:04:04.359> be<00:04:04.509> dead<00:04:04.689> but<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.829> I

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
possibly really be dead but like I

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.759 
possibly really be dead but like I
stated<00:04:06.099> before<00:04:06.280> if<00:04:06.819> she<00:04:07.389> does<00:04:07.629> die<00:04:07.900> then

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
stated before if she does die then

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.249 
stated before if she does die then
that's<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.400> huge<00:04:09.609> problem<00:04:09.819> because<00:04:10.109> she's<00:04:11.109> only

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
that's a huge problem because she's only

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.009 
that's a huge problem because she's only
full<00:04:11.530> once<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.129> we<00:04:12.519> haven't<00:04:12.790> seen<00:04:13.030> waha

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
full once and we haven't seen waha

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.589 
full once and we haven't seen waha
bankai<00:04:14.500> can<00:04:15.159> really<00:04:15.459> do<00:04:15.669> all<00:04:15.939> we<00:04:16.180> see<00:04:16.389> is<00:04:16.419> that

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
bankai can really do all we see is that

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.080 
bankai can really do all we see is that
her<00:04:16.930> bankai<00:04:17.440> seems<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.250> be<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.459> blade<00:04:19.060> that

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
her bankai seems to be a blade that

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.439 
her bankai seems to be a blade that
continuously<00:04:20.049> spurs<00:04:20.530> out<00:04:20.859> blood<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:21.970> that's

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
continuously spurs out blood so that's

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.820 
continuously spurs out blood so that's
pretty<00:04:22.750> much<00:04:22.840> all<00:04:23.050> we<00:04:23.199> know<00:04:23.349> and<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:23.650> don't

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
pretty much all we know and we don't

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.770 
pretty much all we know and we don't
even<00:04:24.099> know<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.610> necessarily<00:04:24.970> blood<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.599> just

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
even know it's necessarily blood it just

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.350 
even know it's necessarily blood it just
looks<00:04:25.960> like<00:04:26.050> blood<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.820> really<00:04:27.820> can't<00:04:28.090> say

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
looks like blood I really can't say

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.450 
looks like blood I really can't say
because<00:04:28.750> I'm<00:04:29.199> not<00:04:29.409> among<00:04:29.650> gawking<00:04:29.949> myself<00:04:30.280> but

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
because I'm not among gawking myself but

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.149 
because I'm not among gawking myself but
I<00:04:30.490> feel<00:04:30.759> as<00:04:30.909> if<00:04:30.940> if<00:04:31.360> Kubel<00:04:32.289> does<00:04:32.530> kill<00:04:32.830> her<00:04:32.949> off

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
I feel as if if Kubel does kill her off

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.640 
I feel as if if Kubel does kill her off
this<00:04:33.880> would<00:04:34.060> be<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> big<00:04:34.690> mistake<00:04:34.720> on<00:04:35.259> Kubo's

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
this would be a big mistake on Kubo's

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.920 
this would be a big mistake on Kubo's
part<00:04:35.950> unless<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.940> course<00:04:36.969> like<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.479> said<00:04:37.719> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
part unless of course like I said a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.100 
part unless of course like I said a
bankai<00:04:38.760> comes<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.180> aid<00:04:40.210> of

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
bankai comes to the aid of

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.340 
bankai comes to the aid of
paci<00:04:41.290> in<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.860> future<00:04:42.190> but<00:04:43.090> if<00:04:43.420> that<00:04:44.020> doesn't

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
paci in the future but if that doesn't

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.820 
paci in the future but if that doesn't
happen<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.890> she<00:04:45.850> does<00:04:46.120> get<00:04:46.990> killed<00:04:47.320> off<00:04:47.530> and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
happen and she does get killed off and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.010 
happen and she does get killed off and
and<00:04:48.010> doesn't<00:04:48.400> show<00:04:48.520> any<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.850> her<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.630> extend

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
and doesn't show any of her to extend

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.040 
and doesn't show any of her to extend
her<00:04:51.010> bankai<00:04:51.460> anything<00:04:51.970> like<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.570> she

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
her bankai anything like that and she

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.110 
her bankai anything like that and she
gets<00:04:53.230> killed<00:04:53.410> off<00:04:53.590> so<00:04:53.740> easily<00:04:54.010> I<00:04:54.370> feel<00:04:54.880> as<00:04:54.970> if

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
gets killed off so easily I feel as if

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.720 
gets killed off so easily I feel as if
kubo<00:04:55.480> will<00:04:55.930> be<00:04:56.320> making<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.680> big<00:04:56.860> mistake<00:04:56.980> it's

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
kubo will be making a big mistake it's

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.160 
kubo will be making a big mistake it's
not<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.120> fact<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.480> she's<00:04:58.690> getting<00:04:58.840> killed

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
not the fact that she's getting killed

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.150 
not the fact that she's getting killed
off<00:04:59.380> is<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.590> fact<00:04:59.800> that<00:04:59.860> she's<00:05:00.070> getting

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
off is the fact that she's getting

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.330 
off is the fact that she's getting
killed<00:05:00.550> off<00:05:00.900> while<00:05:01.900> having<00:05:02.290> no<00:05:02.830> feets<00:05:03.130> in<00:05:03.280> a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
killed off while having no feets in a

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.040 
killed off while having no feets in a
series<00:05:03.610> about<00:05:03.670> showing<00:05:04.240> anything<00:05:04.510> if<00:05:04.840> i<00:05:04.930> was

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
series about showing anything if i was

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.870 
series about showing anything if i was
showing<00:05:05.230> what<00:05:05.440> she<00:05:05.590> can<00:05:05.740> really<00:05:06.160> really<00:05:06.430> do<00:05:06.730> in

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
showing what she can really really do in

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.360 
showing what she can really really do in
this<00:05:07.000> series<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.680> mean<00:05:08.680> it's<00:05:08.920> completely

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
this series I mean it's completely

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.430 
this series I mean it's completely
obvious<00:05:09.730> that<00:05:10.330> she's<00:05:10.510> not<00:05:10.630> going<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.140> stand<00:05:11.350> a

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
obvious that she's not going to stand a

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.890 
obvious that she's not going to stand a
chance<00:05:11.470> against<00:05:11.950> kampachi<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.490> mean<00:05:12.760> she<00:05:13.750> was

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
chance against kampachi I mean she was

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.160 
chance against kampachi I mean she was
being<00:05:14.170> challenged<00:05:14.830> by<00:05:14.890> child<00:05:15.900> zaraki<00:05:16.900> and

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
being challenged by child zaraki and

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.220 
being challenged by child zaraki and
because<00:05:18.010> of<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.160> is<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.520> rocky<00:05:19.120> gains<00:05:19.930> full

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
because of that is a rocky gains full

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.250 
because of that is a rocky gains full
power<00:05:20.440> now<00:05:20.770> as<00:05:21.070> a<00:05:21.730> full<00:05:22.090> adult<00:05:22.510> then<00:05:22.870> she

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
power now as a full adult then she

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.990 
power now as a full adult then she
obviously<00:05:23.740> won't<00:05:23.980> stand<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.370> chance<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.730> knew

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
obviously won't stand a chance I knew

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.800 
obviously won't stand a chance I knew
that<00:05:25.030> coming<00:05:25.450> into<00:05:25.720> this<00:05:25.930> chapter<00:05:26.760> but<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:28.630> not
