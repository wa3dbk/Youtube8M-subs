00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.450
 as scratch protection for the 100 they brought 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.219
 I use very simple baby things 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 a kd 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.240
 that's the smallest size it is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.609
 and they are a bit thicker 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 they are really a kind of terry 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.100
 So say something of material 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.930
 stronger there for the two hands 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.590
 follow a few and then one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.719
 Another few that I wadded with 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:40.489
 stuff it out and get it out of the pot 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:45.329
 reduces fix so fixate better 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.129
 I think it's nice and elastic 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.050
 it can also be very good and that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.969
 wrap round Bavarian and that is 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:12.140
 absurd that a bit of tension so 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:14.580
 until everything is ok Rapunzel 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:30.259
 as I said the first socks on it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:30.259
 17 back strüber and fabrics the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.240
 with so much waiting out there 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.700
 watt your rows that the claw is in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.570
 reason hereby expect a bit 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.120
 so the angie will not play poker 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.940
 the double breaks what makes in relative 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.650
 goes fast 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.020
 if you still try a scratch 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.210
 Something like that I hope that we are so 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.130
 really nice that is a nice kneidl 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:04.530
 will provide every now and then I take this 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 gauze bandage and minister right around 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.690
 not so easy has not too 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.190
 punish about 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.470
 I always follow that up with mine 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.590
 finger is still coming in here that is 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:20.730
 actually the optimal strength that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.730
 is a scratch bright again so endures 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.680
 on again 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.780
 German sky 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.530
 please only two blocks with was 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.650
 the cloudy 10 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:56.780
 the karl schönherr a plug 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:00.830
 appreciate and tight play and a steak 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.300
 or cotton I would say there 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.250
 I already knew percent cotton 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.250
 take and not any are ethics 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.720
 So do not show this fishing that much 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.970
 continue to sweat and play 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.970
 Water is a lawyer 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.970
