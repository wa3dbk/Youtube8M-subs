00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.179
 the guys will finish inside the point 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.460
 Today I'm going to show you what it is and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.160
 what is the routing of skates 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.919
 good people are connected there 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.149
 consists of the following 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:30.000
 you have some larger castaways cases 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.790
 so that she does not all the stock in the soil 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 same time demonstrate how it will 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.050
 the routing with the middle wheels 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.030
 80 mm 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:48.440
 here in the center two wheels of 80 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.910
 millimeters we will use skates 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.399
 we will remove from the center rooms with the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.390
 help with a key besides taking 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.390
 totally wheel 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:18.880
 I'll repeat the process brings two 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:22.840
 central screws screws take off only 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 said place I'll put the wheels 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.740
 of 80 boys 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.439
 I think Robinho puts the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.439
 screws 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.060
 so many people complain that like the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.670
 roller skates at the time of stopping the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.850
 that the problem is that the screw is 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.860
 good practice tells the technique you use 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.300
 You always have one of the screws 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.550
 pumps and has security apart in and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.620
 I have no risk of a loose screw 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.520
 let alone eating the 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:16.350
 bolt is the following I lightly squeeze 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.700
 until the end without making a force I repeat 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:25.870
 in small radio silver do the same thing 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:30.880
 close to light until the end to take us 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:35.230
 I'll come back with the key and give you a 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.830
 tight security does the same thing 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.830
 popular 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.020
 on the caster does not risk loosening 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.160
 also says a company not smuggling 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.680
 has no problem 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.190
 now we can see how the duckling was 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190
 blocked 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.790
 so what's going to happen 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.160
 It's no use, the bigger the two 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.390
 tips 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.819
 I 'm not going to touch it is always on the floor when there is 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.640
 from the front end and touch the ground 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.580
 the back door will not touch it 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.920
 makes it much easier to spin 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.050
 you will see and share share 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.049
 routed makes a lot of difference 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.140
 at first it may seem strange 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.340
 weird skating way but for who 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.459
 likes to insulate it 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.170
 This is the way to go. 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.910
 Good people, that's it, I hope you 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.730
