00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
carbohydrates is four calories per gram

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.710

and of course zero times four is zero
again<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:03.369> take<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.729> one<00:02:03.880> gram<00:02:04.150> of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
again and we take the one gram of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.980 
again and we take the one gram of
protein<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.860> four<00:02:06.159> Keller<00:02:06.780> calories<00:02:07.780> per

gram of protein and of that one times
four<00:02:11.170> equals<00:02:11.200> four<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.370> we<00:02:12.549> take<00:02:12.760> ten<00:02:13.000> minus

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
four equals four so we take ten minus

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.380 
four equals four so we take ten minus
four<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:14.740> have<00:02:14.950> these<00:02:15.099> sets<00:02:15.459> unto<00:02:15.910> counted

surely jello can't be alone so let's

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.250 
surely jello can't be alone so let's
take<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> look<00:02:47.239> at<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.540> ragu<00:02:47.930> pizza<00:02:48.349> sauce<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
take a look at this ragu pizza sauce you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.339 
take a look at this ragu pizza sauce you
can<00:02:51.290> see<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.940> has<00:02:53.000> 40<00:02:53.569> calories<00:02:53.870> per

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
can see that it has 40 calories per

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.099 
can see that it has 40 calories per
serving<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.700> has<00:02:55.879> two<00:02:56.420> grams<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.870> fat

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109

which would make it 16 calories and one

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.149 
which would make it 16 calories and one
gram<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.989> protein<00:03:05.989> which<00:03:06.560> would<00:03:06.769> add<00:03:06.980> in

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
gram of protein which would add in

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.420 
gram of protein which would add in
another<00:03:07.400> 4<00:03:07.940> calories<00:03:08.239> adding<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.230> 18<00:03:09.709> plus<00:03:10.040> 16

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
another 4 calories adding the 18 plus 16

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.940 
another 4 calories adding the 18 plus 16
plus<00:03:10.579> 4<00:03:11.150> gives<00:03:11.420> me<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.959> grand<00:03:12.230> total<00:03:12.409> of<00:03:12.620> 38

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
plus 4 gives me a grand total of 38

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.979 
plus 4 gives me a grand total of 38
calories<00:03:13.609> well<00:03:14.299> what<00:03:14.480> happened<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.870> those

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
calories well what happened to those

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.960

other two kit unaccounted more calories
in<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:18.170> case<00:03:18.409> is<00:03:18.680> probably<00:03:19.220> another<00:03:19.640> half

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
in that case is probably another half

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.599 
in that case is probably another half
gram<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.540> carbs<00:03:21.109> so<00:03:21.680> rather<00:03:21.889> than<00:03:22.130> counting

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.199

this product as a total of 4
carbohydrates<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.389> would<00:03:26.569> count<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.989> as<00:03:27.169> a

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
count for serving as 110 calories so we

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.099

we<00:04:03.019> take<00:04:03.079> we<00:04:03.500> see<00:04:03.709> also<00:04:03.859> see<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:04.340> there<00:04:04.549> are

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
we take we see also see that there are

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.809 
we take we see also see that there are
two<00:04:05.480> grams<00:04:05.780> of<00:04:06.049> carbohydrates<00:04:06.919> within<00:04:07.609> this

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
two grams of carbohydrates within this

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.640 
two grams of carbohydrates within this
so<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.150> do<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.449> easy<00:04:08.599> math<00:04:08.900> two<00:04:09.169> times<00:04:09.410> for

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
so we do the easy math two times for

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.189 
so we do the easy math two times for
eight<00:04:10.040> calories<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:11.269> finally<00:04:11.720> we<00:04:11.870> look<00:04:12.049> at

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
eight calories and finally we look at

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.860 
eight calories and finally we look at
proteins<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.919> we<00:04:13.220> see<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:14.180> has<00:04:14.359> one<00:04:14.389> gram<00:04:14.840> of

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
proteins and we see it has one gram of

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.439 
proteins and we see it has one gram of
protein<00:04:15.019> we<00:04:15.859> do<00:04:16.039> the<00:04:16.220> easy<00:04:16.400> math<00:04:16.699> one<00:04:17.180> times

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
protein we do the easy math one times

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.909 
protein we do the easy math one times
four<00:04:17.750> four<00:04:18.199> calories

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
four four calories

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.879 
four four calories
add<00:04:19.099> up<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.699> amounts<00:04:20.419> 90<00:04:21.199> calories<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.769> the

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
add up the amounts 90 calories for the

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.270 
add up the amounts 90 calories for the
fat<00:04:22.130> eight<00:04:22.760> calories<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:24.280> carbohydrates

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
fat eight calories for the carbohydrates

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.880 
fat eight calories for the carbohydrates
and<00:04:25.430> four<00:04:25.729> calories<00:04:26.150> for<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.479> protein<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.050> we

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
and four calories for the protein and we

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.580 
and four calories for the protein and we
end<00:04:28.219> up<00:04:28.340> with<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> grand<00:04:28.760> total<00:04:28.969> of<00:04:29.180> 102<00:04:29.900> Keller

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
end up with a grand total of 102 Keller

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.880 
end up with a grand total of 102 Keller

thing well what are they well they're
probably<00:04:38.030> fat<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.660> they're<00:04:38.840> probably<00:04:39.080> some

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
probably fat and they're probably some

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.860 
probably fat and they're probably some
more<00:04:39.920> carbohydrates<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:40.970> potentially<00:04:41.690> some
