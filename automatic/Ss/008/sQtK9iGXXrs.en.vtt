00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.360 

pretty<00:04:35.110> remarkable<00:04:35.440> isn't<00:04:35.860> it

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.700 

I<00:04:38.460> think

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.890 

with<00:04:47.010> windows<00:04:47.340> 95<00:04:47.790> was<00:04:47.970> still<00:04:48.210> based<00:04:48.419> on<00:04:48.630> dust

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
with windows 95 was still based on dust

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.220 
with windows 95 was still based on dust
so<00:04:49.290> that's<00:04:50.040> why<00:04:50.250> dust<00:04:50.639> games<00:04:50.910> always<00:04:51.300> ran<00:04:51.720> good

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
so that's why dust games always ran good

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.550 
so that's why dust games always ran good

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.690 
Windows ME was also based on das
