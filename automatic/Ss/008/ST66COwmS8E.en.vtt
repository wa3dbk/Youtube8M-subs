you wanted to do smaller ones they come
in<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> variety<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.680> different<00:01:13.799> sizes<00:01:14.100> really

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
in a variety of different sizes really

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.980 
in a variety of different sizes really
easy<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> work<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
easy to work with so I'm just going to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
easy to work with so I'm just going to
take<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> route<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
take the route and see what it's kind of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.210 
take the route and see what it's kind of
hard<00:01:18.170> I'm<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> run<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> under<00:01:19.799> water<00:01:19.830> on

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
hard I'm going to run it under water on

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.990 
hard I'm going to run it under water on
both<00:01:20.400> sides

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
both sides

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.480 
both sides
so<00:01:22.570> there<00:01:23.050> are<00:01:23.230> different<00:01:23.410> directions<00:01:24.160> on<00:01:24.370> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
so there are different directions on the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.000 
so there are different directions on the
package<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:26.050> tell<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.380> how<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.560> make<00:01:26.770> these

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
package to tell you how to make these

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.760 
package to tell you how to make these
this<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.910> way<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.150> I<00:01:28.330> do<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.750> I'm<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.680> you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
this is the way that I do it I'm so you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.830 
this is the way that I do it I'm so you
can<00:01:29.890> try<00:01:30.070> like<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.790> can<00:01:30.970> try<00:01:31.210> with

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
can try like this so you can try with

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.160 
can try like this so you can try with
the<00:01:31.960> directions<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.800> shake<00:01:33.130> off<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.460> excess

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the directions of shake off the excess

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.230 
the directions of shake off the excess
water<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.340> I'll<00:01:36.430> bring<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.729> back<00:01:36.850> over<00:01:37.060> here

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.850 
water and I'll bring it back over here
to<00:01:37.390> our<00:01:37.420> board<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.350> still<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.560> little<00:01:38.680> bit

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
to our board so it's still a little bit

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.350 
to our board so it's still a little bit
hard<00:01:39.100> right<00:01:39.280> now<00:01:39.310> but<00:01:39.610> as<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:39.940> feel<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.240> it's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
hard right now but as we feel it it's

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.910 
hard right now but as we feel it it's
going<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.510> stop<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.869> right<00:01:40.990> up<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.800> we'll

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.560 
blanched those right yes we blanched
them<00:02:03.399> so<00:02:03.670> we<00:02:03.820> put<00:02:04.000> them<00:02:04.090> into<00:02:04.210> some<00:02:04.420> boiling

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
them so we put them into some boiling

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.320 
them so we put them into some boiling
water<00:02:04.750> for<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.440> few<00:02:05.619> minutes<00:02:05.800> until<00:02:06.789> they

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
water for just a few minutes until they

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.300 
water for just a few minutes until they
were<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.869> bright<00:02:08.320> bright<00:02:08.500> green<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.130> then<00:02:09.220> we

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
were a bright bright green and then we

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.280 
were a bright bright green and then we
threw<00:02:09.550> them<00:02:09.700> into<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.119> bowl<00:02:10.450> full<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.780> ice<00:02:10.989> and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.290 
threw them into a bowl full of ice and
water<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.459> stops<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> cooking<00:02:13.000> process

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300

because you don't want it to get to get

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.530 
because you don't want it to get to get
over<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:15.790> amount<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.120> kind<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.360> mushy

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
over that amount and kind of mushy

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.970 
over that amount and kind of mushy
