lot of fun to play with this team and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.530 
lot of fun to play with this team and
having<00:03:18.769> him<00:03:19.130> up<00:03:19.280> there<00:03:19.489> kind<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.150> adds<00:03:20.299> another

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
having him up there kind of adds another

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.690 
having him up there kind of adds another
dimension<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:21.200> my<00:03:21.350> team<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.859> lot<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.459> time

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
dimension to my team a lot of the time

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.879 
dimension to my team a lot of the time
my<00:03:23.209> Fords<00:03:23.630> are<00:03:23.720> small<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.230> here's<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> prime

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
my Fords are small and here's a prime

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.309 
my Fords are small and here's a prime
example<00:03:24.920> Honda<00:03:25.700> whips<00:03:25.910> one<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:27.079> tues

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
example Honda whips one in and a tues

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.410 
example Honda whips one in and a tues
height<00:03:27.620> he<00:03:27.859> is<00:03:27.980> quite<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.250> tall<00:03:28.489> chap<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.910> believe

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
height he is quite a tall chap I believe

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.690 
height he is quite a tall chap I believe
he's<00:03:29.540> six<00:03:29.840> foot<00:03:29.989> something<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:31.250> not<00:03:31.400> exactly

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
he's six foot something I'm not exactly

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.550 
he's six foot something I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:31.880> but<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.269> mean<00:03:32.389> he<00:03:32.510> provides<00:03:33.079> height<00:03:33.319> so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
sure but I mean he provides height so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.289 
sure but I mean he provides height so
like<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.889> said<00:03:33.950> he<00:03:34.130> adds<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.370> bit<00:03:34.519> more<00:03:34.549> of<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.850> new

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
like I said he adds a bit more of a new

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.660 
like I said he adds a bit more of a new
dimension<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.840> my<00:03:35.959> ultimate<00:03:36.380> team<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.739> yeah

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
dimension to my ultimate team and yeah

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.699 
dimension to my ultimate team and yeah
it's<00:03:38.269> exciting<00:03:38.780> stuff<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.260> be<00:03:39.350> honest<00:03:39.590> with

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
it's exciting stuff to be honest with

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.920 
it's exciting stuff to be honest with
you<00:03:39.799> because<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.160> know<00:03:40.760> I've<00:03:41.150> never<00:03:41.299> used<00:03:41.690> him

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
you because you know I've never used him

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
a lot in ultimate team so this would be

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.110 
a lot in ultimate team so this would be
my<00:03:44.359> first<00:03:44.389> time<00:03:44.780> really<00:03:45.109> you<00:03:45.410> know<00:03:45.530> getting

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.860 
the you know it's rare that you come up
across<00:03:51.230> someone<00:03:51.560> who's<00:03:51.769> tall<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:53.000> feels<00:03:53.480> fast

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
across someone who's tall and feels fast

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.900 
across someone who's tall and feels fast
you<00:03:54.260> know<00:03:54.350> this<00:03:54.530> guy<00:03:54.590> feels<00:03:54.920> fast<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.519> forced

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
you know this guy feels fast and forced

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.160 
you know this guy feels fast and forced
our<00:03:56.000> skills<00:03:56.269> obviously<00:03:56.510> as<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:56.930> in<00:03:56.989> their

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
our skills obviously as you see in their

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.379 
our skills obviously as you see in their
advanced<00:03:57.829> rabo<00:03:58.190> flick<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.609> then<00:03:58.700> he<00:03:58.790> just<00:03:58.819> not

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
advanced rabo flick and then he just not

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.789 
advanced rabo flick and then he just not
just<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.630> past<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.019> keeper<00:04:00.170> into<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> goal

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
just that past the keeper into the goal

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.940 
just that past the keeper into the goal
so<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.220> mean<00:04:02.090> he's<00:04:02.269> scoring<00:04:02.569> nice<00:04:02.840> goals<00:04:03.139> and

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.890 
so I mean he's scoring nice goals and
like<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.609> was<00:04:04.730> saying<00:04:04.880> he<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:05.180> feels<00:04:05.420> fast<00:04:05.690> I

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
like I was saying he just feels fast I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.210 
like I was saying he just feels fast I
mean<00:04:06.079> there's<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.560> lot<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.709> players<00:04:06.950> out<00:04:07.190> there

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
but and like I was saying there's a lot

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.849 
but and like I was saying there's a lot
of<00:04:16.430> lot<00:04:16.970> tall<00:04:17.299> large<00:04:17.750> players<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.470> know<00:04:18.620> with

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
90-odd pace but they just don't feel

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.560 
90-odd pace but they just don't feel
fast<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.769> Obafemi<00:04:22.070> Martins<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.820> s<00:04:23.030> who<00:04:23.180> are

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
fast and Obafemi Martins and s who are

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.940 
fast and Obafemi Martins and s who are
both<00:04:23.780> two<00:04:24.050> players<00:04:24.349> that<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.830> know

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
both two players that you know

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.740 
both two players that you know
completely<00:04:25.280> contradict<00:04:26.030> what<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.360> just<00:04:26.599> said

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
completely contradict what I just said

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.430 
completely contradict what I just said
there

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
there

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.530 
there
because<00:04:27.830> they<00:04:28.010> are<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.880> know<00:04:29.000> over<00:04:29.420> from

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
because they are you know over from

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.420 
because they are you know over from
artesia<00:04:29.870> he<00:04:30.170> notes<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.440> is<00:04:30.800> not<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.190> biggest

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
artesia he notes that is not the biggest

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.210 
artesia he notes that is not the biggest
guy<00:04:31.760> but<00:04:32.000> he<00:04:32.120> certainly<00:04:32.480> feels<00:04:33.350> really<00:04:33.860> fast

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
guy but he certainly feels really fast

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.220 
guy but he certainly feels really fast
and<00:04:34.520> they<00:04:34.760> are<00:04:34.820> showing<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.300> heat<00:04:35.450> at<00:04:35.990> who's

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
and they are showing the heat at who's

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.590 
and they are showing the heat at who's
got<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.620> ball<00:04:37.310> roll<00:04:37.580> skills<00:04:37.970> followed<00:04:38.450> by<00:04:38.570> a

got the ball roll skills followed by a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.830 
got the ball roll skills followed by a
nice<00:04:38.930> cheeky<00:04:39.290> finesse<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:40.480> I'm<00:04:41.480> not<00:04:41.660> going<00:04:41.780> to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
nice cheeky finesse and I'm not going to

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.840 
nice cheeky finesse and I'm not going to
lie<00:04:41.900> using<00:04:42.320> this<00:04:42.470> team<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.950> probably<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.820> most

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
lie using this team is probably the most

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.020 
lie using this team is probably the most
