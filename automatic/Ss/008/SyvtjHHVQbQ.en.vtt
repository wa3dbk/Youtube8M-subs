 ask fede wolf this section so 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.340
 original and objective it occurred to me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.940

 on social networks on youtube here in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.520
 the comments on twitter and on facebook 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 and I'm going to make a special video to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.719
 clear that yes this so that you feel that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430
 there's more interaction, not like these 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 pinches bloggers jets that do not answer 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.390
 lauro by phone to lawful king I do not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.940
 güey answers the truth wherever it 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 it's busy but not good let's stop 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.840
 ground it at those times of the everywhere and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.730
 let's start the section as what 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 is your full name my full name 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 It is Federico Díaz Coins to serve him 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.580
 you and also goodbye more to God because 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.810
 I do not tell you what it was that you 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.549
 motivated to create a channel 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.560
 videogames since he said- I liked it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.659
 the video games but we also discard 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 I liked watching programs like cyber net 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.229
 and nintendo mania this pair of programs 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 they were very dear in childhood to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.670
 many and there was born the idea that I 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.560
 I wanted to make some day of my life a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.350
 video game channel on youtube and already 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 I knew about tennis, it's not true, not in 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.159
 youtube but if I wanted to do something about 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.630
 to work or write about some 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.399
 video game and good comes a moment 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 where is where youtube started 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.689
 do as a network of werevertumorro 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.759
 where a movie channel was made and a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.619
 football channel and there was born the idea of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.569
 that I made a video game channel 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.459
 that someone later commented that 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.200
 the guitarist only the football channel 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.880
 it's just that video game channel what 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.770
 make two people and like the good one 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.259
 I liked video games because we made 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.200
 an alliance and beautiful and the channel was created 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.869
 of the coffee box end you prefer xbox 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.420
 one play 4 and because then first that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.880
 nothing let me tell you that I am a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.189
 person who has two consoles because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.080
 I'm very rich obviously every console 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.239
 has its pros and cons not for 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.940
 example in the xbox there is a lot of community 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.660
 all my friends have xbox nobody uses 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 Play Station 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 but I think playstation 4 is a 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.480
 much faster machine 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.970
 Updates last little if you install 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.520
 a game lasts much less than in xbox 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.740
 apart if you like to buy online is 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.110
 much cheaper ai xbox and playstation 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.300
 they get very hot but the playstation 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.310
 It makes a lot of noise and it's a matter of 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.060
 I do not like but I am very rich 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060
 have long 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.819
 sometimes he sees me with the same shirt but 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.889
 it's because I want because I want to 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.719
 and I today efe of the wolf what would happen if 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.579
 one day he will wake up if you do not have anything 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.040
 of what you have hey question faith of she-wolf 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.760
 how would that greeting react just because 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.469
 I buy it and look güey hear that 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.870
 you almost do not use instagram if you want 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.239
 keep an eye on me I'm like I'm a wolf's faith 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.829
 I already do a little bit of other things 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.019
 I do not go out there so much, I'm always 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.450
 locked in the same damn room of 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.489
 recording gameplays but you are not 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.209
 took pictures to the corner of the room or not 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.519
 I know the microphone or you like the system of 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.859

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.069

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.160

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.950

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.390
 more do you like batman crazy breasts me 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.430
 I think the batman personality is 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.530
 very good but what made me out 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.080
 fan is that the good has superpowers 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.730

 an aig fan has made for him to see it 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:06.539
 one day I was in a cohabitation 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.189
 many subscribers around and I was 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.159
 there as if waving between 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.559
 notebook and today is the other and suddenly 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.559
 I was very happy I'm suddenly back 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:18.809
 I feel a squeeze in the buttock I turn and 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.419
 a rita master with an angelic face that 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:23.490
 he looks at me and then I deduced that 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.169
 was and respect the buttocks of the others 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.809
 Fucked up and a good part of that come 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.389
 other things like how I already believe you I think 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:33.599
 that the girl wrote ayala I think it's 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.860
 that respect the spelling chingada ma 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.869
 that we can help you your subscribers 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.550
 to make you grow more apart from 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:40.649

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.779
 ask him to clear that if you can 

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:44.580
 give money the video game that touched you 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.800

 I'm disappointed but devil may 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.580
 cry 4 was not what I expected at first 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:55.769
 because the character we play with 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.760
 is not dante and second because the 

00:06:55.769 --> 00:07:01.840

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.070
 between social networks twitter 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.570
 facebook and also the youtube channel 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.250
 so the bottom part in the 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.290
 comments leave your existential doubts 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.300
