is<00:00:42.620> can<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:42.979> learn<00:00:43.219> anything<00:00:43.370> about<00:00:43.789> the

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
is can we learn anything about the

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.669 
is can we learn anything about the

don't know but what we can all figure
out<00:00:50.989> pretty<00:00:51.289> easily<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.069> when<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.280> take

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
out pretty easily is that when you take

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.549 
out pretty easily is that when you take
a<00:00:52.519> big<00:00:52.789> chunk<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.239> foam<00:00:53.449> out<00:00:53.719> of<00:00:53.929> the<00:00:54.019> deck<00:00:54.289> to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
a big chunk of foam out of the deck to

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.200 
a big chunk of foam out of the deck to
create<00:00:54.829> this<00:00:54.979> concave<00:00:55.549> if<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.789> brings<00:00:55.999> your

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
create this concave if it brings your

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.569 
create this concave if it brings your
feet<00:00:56.569> closer<00:00:57.049> to<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.469> water<00:00:57.679> than<00:00:57.889> a<00:00:58.159> flat

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
say the paddling on a board like this is

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:04.390 
say the paddling on a board like this is
easier<00:01:03.139> because<00:01:03.379> your<00:01:03.649> chest<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.159> stomach

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
surfers would say that this kind of a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.179

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.480 
really excites me about this board is
how<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.869> employs<00:01:24.170> these<00:01:24.439> unique<00:01:24.829> channels<00:01:25.340> you

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
how it employs these unique channels you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.279 
how it employs these unique channels you
can<00:01:25.549> probably<00:01:25.850> see<00:01:26.329> these<00:01:26.570> channels<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:27.229> how

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
can probably see these channels and how

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.020 
can probably see these channels and how
they're<00:01:27.409> shaped<00:01:27.710> back<00:01:27.979> there<00:01:28.250> into<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.850> back

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
they're shaped back there into the back

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.090 
they're shaped back there into the back
of<00:01:29.270> third<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.109> board<00:01:30.350> towards<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.859> tail

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
of third of the board towards the tail

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.039 
of third of the board towards the tail
channels<00:01:31.549> make<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> surfboard<00:01:31.969> faster<00:01:32.659> because

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
channels make a surfboard faster because

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.200 
channels make a surfboard faster because
of<00:01:33.079> how<00:01:33.259> they<00:01:33.409> create<00:01:33.740> lift<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.520> because<00:01:35.179> of

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
of how they create lift and because of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.149 
of how they create lift and because of
how<00:01:35.420> they<00:01:35.570> accelerate<00:01:36.140> water<00:01:36.469> flow<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:37.039> when

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
how they accelerate water flow but when

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.919 
how they accelerate water flow but when
a<00:01:37.189> channel<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.670> too<00:01:37.850> deep<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:38.539> be<00:01:38.659> really

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
a channel is too deep it can be really

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.020 
a channel is too deep it can be really
susceptible<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.710> chop<00:01:40.009> on<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.490> water<00:01:40.700> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
susceptible to chop on the water and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.700 
susceptible to chop on the water and
that<00:01:41.450> can<00:01:41.600> make<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.840> board<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:42.109> not<00:01:42.439> work

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
that can make the board just not work

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.370 
that can make the board just not work
also<00:01:43.009> when<00:01:43.429> a<00:01:43.460> channel<00:01:43.729> is<00:01:44.060> straight<00:01:44.810> that

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
also when a channel is straight that

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.499 
also when a channel is straight that
makes<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.770> surfboard<00:01:46.249> want<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.700> go<00:01:46.880> straight

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
makes the surfboard want to go straight

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.239 
makes the surfboard want to go straight
these<00:01:47.960> channels<00:01:48.380> are<00:01:48.469> really<00:01:48.679> unique<00:01:49.009> because

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
these channels are really unique because

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.730 
these channels are really unique because
they<00:01:49.609> are<00:01:49.670> curved<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.479> because<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.409> channels

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
they are curved and because the channels

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.319 
they are curved and because the channels
are<00:01:51.859> shallow<00:01:52.189> they're<00:01:52.520> not<00:01:52.670> really<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:53.060> deep

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
are shallow they're not really that deep

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.999 
are shallow they're not really that deep
the<00:01:53.659> curve<00:01:53.929> means<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.499> the<00:01:54.590> board<00:01:54.829> can

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
the curve means that the board can

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.649 
the curve means that the board can
actually<00:01:55.280> maneuver<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:55.969> wants<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.240> do<00:01:56.420> things

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
actually maneuver and wants to do things

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.239 
actually maneuver and wants to do things
other<00:01:56.780> than<00:01:56.899> go<00:01:57.109> straight<00:01:57.499> and<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.009> shallow

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
other than go straight and the shallow

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.830 
other than go straight and the shallow
depth<00:01:58.609> of<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.880> channels<00:01:59.270> means<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.719> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
depth of the channels means that the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.719 
depth of the channels means that the
Borgo<00:02:00.170> completely<00:02:00.679> shut<00:02:00.950> down<00:02:01.249> when<00:02:01.609> the

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
Borgo completely shut down when the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.340 
Borgo completely shut down when the
conditions<00:02:02.119> get<00:02:02.299> messy<00:02:02.569> what<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.990> means<00:02:03.170> is

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
conditions get messy what that means is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.080 
conditions get messy what that means is
that<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.679> board<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.069> abnormally<00:02:04.579> versatile

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
that this board is abnormally versatile

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.730 
that this board is abnormally versatile
when<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.420> compare<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.929> other<00:02:06.020> surfboards

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740

leading two fins and the quad fins one
of<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.710> things<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:22.190> know<00:02:22.280> about<00:02:22.310> fins<00:02:22.880> is

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
of the things that we know about fins is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.760 
of the things that we know about fins is
that<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> width<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.990> base<00:02:24.230> directly

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
that the width of the base directly

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.440 
that the width of the base directly
relates<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.190> how<00:02:25.310> much<00:02:25.430> drive<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.940> speed<00:02:26.210> we

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
relates to how much drive and speed we

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
relates to how much drive and speed we
have<00:02:26.600> coming<00:02:26.840> off<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.080> bottom<00:02:27.560> term<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.100> if<00:02:28.220> we

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
have coming off of bottom term so if we

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.340 
have coming off of bottom term so if we
put<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> fin<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.270> quad<00:02:29.480> trailing<00:02:29.960> position

put a fin in the quad trailing position

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.900 
put a fin in the quad trailing position
on<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> board<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.100> can<00:02:31.220> easily<00:02:31.640> see<00:02:31.880> how

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
on the board we can easily see how

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.210 
on the board we can easily see how
functionally<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.260> fin<00:02:33.530> has<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:34.010> elongated

functionally the fin has an elongated

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.400 
functionally the fin has an elongated
base<00:02:34.970> because<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.660> way<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.990> channel

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
base because of the way that the channel

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
this board up as a quad you can probably

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.850 
this board up as a quad you can probably
push<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.600> into<00:02:47.720> hyperdrive<00:02:48.110> pretty<00:02:48.590> quickly

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
push it into hyperdrive pretty quickly

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.530 
push it into hyperdrive pretty quickly
because<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.610> way<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.000> base<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.420> your

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
because of the way that the base of your

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.210 
because of the way that the base of your
fins<00:02:50.810> will<00:02:51.170> work<00:02:51.380> with<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.770> channel

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
fins will work with the channel

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.830 
fins will work with the channel
I<00:02:52.280> think<00:02:52.490> this<00:02:52.640> tail<00:02:52.880> design<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.420> really<00:02:53.660> cool

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
I think this tail design is really cool

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.780 
I think this tail design is really cool
because<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.320> keeps<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.650> outline<00:02:55.070> flow<00:02:55.430> going

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
because it keeps the outline flow going

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.010 
because it keeps the outline flow going
all<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> way<00:02:56.120> back<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.600> end<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.840> board

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
all the way back to the end of the board

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.930 
all the way back to the end of the board
right<00:02:57.200> here<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:57.710> then<00:02:57.860> right<00:02:58.130> in<00:02:58.370> front<00:02:58.700> of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
right here but then right in front of

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240 
right here but then right in front of
the<00:02:59.240> rear<00:02:59.420> quad<00:02:59.720> trailer<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.800> step

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
the rear quad trailer we have a step

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.710 
the rear quad trailer we have a step
rail<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.760> starts<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.120> happen<00:03:02.270> right<00:03:02.510> here

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
rail that starts to happen right here

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.360 
rail that starts to happen right here
can<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.990> see<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.350> how<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.590> rail<00:03:03.890> shaves

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
can you see that how the rail shaves

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.120 
can you see that how the rail shaves
down<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:05.090> create<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.630> step<00:03:06.290> down<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.950> rail

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
down to create a step down in the rail

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.070 
down to create a step down in the rail
like<00:03:07.430> right<00:03:07.700> here<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.150> my<00:03:08.360> mind<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.780> helps

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
like right here in my mind that helps

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.870 
like right here in my mind that helps

the board wide coming out here through
the<00:03:12.800> tail<00:03:13.010> but<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.430> also<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.030> rounded

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
the tail but we also have this rounded

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
really want to it's interesting to note

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540 
really want to it's interesting to note
that<00:03:29.870> these<00:03:30.170> channels<00:03:30.709> actually<00:03:30.890> occur

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
that these channels actually occur

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.790 
that these channels actually occur
within<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:32.300> double<00:03:32.660> concave<00:03:32.840> on<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.320> board<00:03:33.560> we

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
within a double concave on the board we

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.770 
within a double concave on the board we
can<00:03:33.950> see<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.310> double<00:03:34.610> concave<00:03:34.820> runs<00:03:35.420> all

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
can see that the double concave runs all

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.060 
can see that the double concave runs all
the<00:03:35.840> way<00:03:36.080> up<00:03:36.200> through<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> rear<00:03:36.740> quad

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
the way up through the rear quad

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.250 
the way up through the rear quad
trailers<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.790> continues<00:03:38.600> going<00:03:38.810> all<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.230> way

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.320 
trailers and continues going all the way
up<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.770> mighty<00:03:40.100> healthy<00:03:40.580> V<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.180> then

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
up in a mighty healthy V and then

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.910 
up in a mighty healthy V and then
eventually<00:03:41.720> dropping<00:03:42.050> out<00:03:42.350> towards<00:03:42.800> the

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920

eventually dropping out towards the
thumb<00:03:43.130> tail<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:43.640> really<00:03:44.000> subtle<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.480> you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
thumb tail this is really subtle and you

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.090 
thumb tail this is really subtle and you
might<00:03:44.690> not<00:03:44.840> be<00:03:44.959> able<00:03:45.110> to<00:03:45.170> see<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.500> at<00:03:45.620> home<00:03:45.860> but

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
might not be able to see it at home but

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.530 
might not be able to see it at home but
if<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.340> could<00:03:46.459> look<00:03:46.520> really<00:03:46.820> closely<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.390> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
if you could look really closely at the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.630 
if you could look really closely at the
V<00:03:47.780> on<00:03:47.989> this<00:03:48.140> board<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.739> actually<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.310> pretty

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
V on this board it actually is pretty

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.640 
V on this board it actually is pretty
deep<00:03:49.970> right<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:50.270> but<00:03:50.780> then<00:03:50.930> he<00:03:51.020> shaves<00:03:51.410> off

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
deep right here but then he shaves off

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.410 
deep right here but then he shaves off
the<00:03:52.040> stringer<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.550> foam<00:03:52.760> up<00:03:53.000> towards<00:03:53.300> the

the stringer in the foam up towards the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.180 
the stringer in the foam up towards the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
tail to make this right here much

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.550 
tail to make this right here much
thinner<00:03:55.520> than<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:56.360> right<00:03:56.690> here<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.320> means

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
thinner than this right here that means

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.840 
thinner than this right here that means
that<00:03:57.739> we<00:03:57.800> can<00:03:57.950> have<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.100> little<00:03:58.430> bit<00:03:58.550> of<00:03:58.640> extra

push up towards the lift because of the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.740 
push up towards the lift because of the
