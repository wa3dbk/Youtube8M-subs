pressure to be you know in this very

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.680 
pressure to be you know in this very
thin<00:02:50.750> world<00:02:51.109> you<00:02:51.829> know<00:02:51.920> accessed<00:02:52.430> world<00:02:52.819> how

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
thin world you know accessed world how

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.330

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
conquer those fears that they may have

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.660 
conquer those fears that they may have
well<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.799> think<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.069> first<00:02:58.220> thing<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.549> realize

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
well I think the first thing to realize

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.430 
well I think the first thing to realize
is<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.150> even<00:02:59.599> if<00:02:59.690> you're<00:02:59.780> not<00:02:59.900> fat<00:03:00.200> you'll

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
is that even if you're not fat you'll

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.229 
is that even if you're not fat you'll
probably<00:03:00.650> never<00:03:00.980> be<00:03:01.220> thin<00:03:01.400> enough<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.700> fit<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
probably never be thin enough to fit the

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.149 
probably never be thin enough to fit the
societal<00:03:02.750> ideal<00:03:03.170> there's<00:03:03.470> always<00:03:03.680> something

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159
