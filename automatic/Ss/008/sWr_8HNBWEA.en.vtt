00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
two days it's helped me a lot to be a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619 
two days it's helped me a lot to be a
lot<00:00:50.250> more<00:00:50.280> stable<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.210> able<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> kick

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
circles that he drew that represent

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
circles that he drew that represent
basically<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> only<00:01:01.890> movements<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> where<00:01:02.789> my

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520 
basically the only movements of where my
feet<00:01:03.210> should<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.809> before<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.260> after

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.679 
little be a lot more stable your
distance<00:01:48.610> will<00:01:48.759> change<00:01:49.030> based<00:01:49.270> on<00:01:49.450> where<00:01:49.570> the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
distance will change based on where the

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.240 
distance will change based on where the
bag<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.259> how<00:01:50.380> tall<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.740> are<00:01:50.770> all<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.100> rest

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
bag is and how tall you are all the rest

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.999 
bag is and how tall you are all the rest
of<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.750> eyes<00:01:52.899> this<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.800> about

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
of it is about the eyes this is about

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.440 
of it is about the eyes this is about
the<00:01:54.220> right<00:01:54.340> distance<00:01:54.369> for<00:01:55.000> me<00:01:55.119> hold<00:01:55.330> on

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
the right distance for me hold on

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.300 
the right distance for me hold on
evidence<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:55.990> when<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.200> take<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.440> right<00:01:56.679> or<00:01:57.280> a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
evidence so when I take a right or a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.039 
evidence so when I take a right or a
left<00:01:57.340> kick<00:01:57.670> instead<00:01:57.970> of<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.659> going<00:01:58.840> straight

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
left kick instead of just going straight

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.410 
left kick instead of just going straight
to<00:01:59.289> kick<00:01:59.530> from<00:01:59.740> here<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.159> step<00:02:00.610> up<00:02:01.060> with<00:02:01.119> my

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
to kick from here I step up with my

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.710 
to kick from here I step up with my
right<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.979> then<00:02:03.789> back<00:02:03.970> into<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.450> back

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
right and then back into that back

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.050 
right and then back into that back
triangle<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.069> I'm<00:02:06.250> going<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.429> do<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.580> few<00:02:06.789> kicks

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
triangle so I'm going to do a few kicks

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.210 
triangle so I'm going to do a few kicks
here<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.569> can<00:02:07.750> link<00:02:07.899> out<00:02:08.080> move<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.440> see<00:02:08.590> you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.820 

so<00:02:45.490> as<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.820> see<00:02:45.880> you're<00:02:46.180> moving<00:02:46.830> across
