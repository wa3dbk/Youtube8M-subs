00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
my first source was figs I calculated

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.780 
my first source was figs I calculated
that<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:32.660> needed<00:00:32.870> 20<00:00:33.260> figs<00:00:33.530> on<00:00:33.739> a<00:00:33.800> bike<00:00:34.460> leg<00:00:34.670> to

in<00:00:37.550> all<00:00:37.640> those<00:00:37.850> figs<00:00:38.210> I've<00:00:38.570> never<00:00:38.690> seen<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.989> lot

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
in all those figs I've never seen a lot

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.920 
in all those figs I've never seen a lot
of<00:00:39.110> shots<00:00:39.379> on<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.070> run<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.850> at<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.629> time<00:00:41.690> I

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
of shots on the run and at that time I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.590 
of shots on the run and at that time I

shirt<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.140> could<00:00:45.320> see<00:00:45.470> my<00:00:45.589> stomach<00:00:45.830> was

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
shirt and I could see my stomach was

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.610 
shirt and I could see my stomach was
totally<00:00:46.430> distended<00:00:47.000> all<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.839> water<00:00:48.080> at<00:00:48.440> least

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
totally distended all the water at least

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.259 
totally distended all the water at least
almost<00:00:48.949> all<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.250> water<00:00:49.400> was<00:00:49.580> going<00:00:49.820> into<00:00:50.150> my

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
almost all the water was going into my

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.759 
almost all the water was going into my
stomach<00:00:50.510> could<00:00:50.690> try<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:50.870> digest<00:00:51.110> those<00:00:51.440> figs

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
stomach could try to digest those figs

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.410 
stomach could try to digest those figs
fortunately<00:00:52.610> for<00:00:52.729> me<00:00:52.760> I<00:00:52.850> was<00:00:53.059> able<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.299> get

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
fortunately for me I was able to get

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.660 
fortunately for me I was able to get
through<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.690> race<00:00:54.339> without<00:00:55.339> too<00:00:55.519> much

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
through the race without too much

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.149 
through the race without too much
trouble<00:00:55.879> well<00:00:56.570> muscular<00:00:57.379> failure<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.830> caused

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
trouble well muscular failure is caused

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.219 
trouble well muscular failure is caused
by<00:00:58.400> a<00:00:58.430> lot<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.699> different<00:00:58.820> things<00:00:59.299> and<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.110> one

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
by a lot of different things and the one

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:01.750 
by a lot of different things and the one
that<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.440> decided<00:01:00.830> is<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.250> can<00:01:01.370> overload

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
that I decided is that you can overload

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.060 
that I decided is that you can overload
your<00:01:01.970> GI<00:01:02.210> tract<00:01:02.629> with<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.500> heavy<00:01:03.799> concentration

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
your GI tract with a heavy concentration

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.890 
your GI tract with a heavy concentration
of<00:01:04.640> any<00:01:04.820> type<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.180> food<00:01:05.510> whether<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.840> be

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
of any type of food whether it be

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.600 
of any type of food whether it be
carbohydrate<00:01:06.530> protein<00:01:06.680> or<00:01:07.040> fat<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.460> could

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
carbohydrate protein or fat that could

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.670 
carbohydrate protein or fat that could
be<00:01:07.700> disastrous<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.840> first<00:01:09.110> one<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.380> actually

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
be disastrous the first one is actually

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.440 
be disastrous the first one is actually
dehydration<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:10.909> have<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.240> watch<00:01:11.420> your

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
dehydration and you have to watch your

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.450 
dehydration and you have to watch your
hydration<00:01:12.020> levels<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.710> make<00:01:12.860> sure<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.310> you

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
hydration levels to make sure that you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.280 
hydration levels to make sure that you
don't<00:01:13.640> get<00:01:13.850> dehydrated<00:01:14.030> your<00:01:14.900> thirst

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
don't get dehydrated your thirst

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.139 
don't get dehydrated your thirst
mechanism<00:01:15.500> actually<00:01:16.369> is<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> fairly<00:01:16.909> good

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
mechanism actually is a fairly good

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.999 
mechanism actually is a fairly good
indicator<00:01:17.719> of<00:01:17.840> when<00:01:18.200> you're<00:01:18.350> thirsty<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
indicator of when you're thirsty the

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.279 
indicator of when you're thirsty the
problem<00:01:19.399> is<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.520> people<00:01:19.759> drink<00:01:20.689> too

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
problem is that people drink too

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.870 
problem is that people drink too
infrequently<00:01:21.890> ideally<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.520> should<00:01:22.549> drink

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
infrequently ideally you should drink

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.330 
infrequently ideally you should drink
every<00:01:23.149> 4<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.450> 10<00:01:23.689> minutes<00:01:23.930> with<00:01:24.200> small<00:01:24.500> sips<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
every 4 to 10 minutes with small sips so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.529 
every 4 to 10 minutes with small sips so
when<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.549> take<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.759> drink<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.210> your<00:01:26.329> food

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
when you take a drink of your food

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.249 
when you take a drink of your food
replacement<00:01:27.079> drink<00:01:27.320> just<00:01:27.530> take<00:01:27.740> quick<00:01:27.979> ones

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.590 
at any time during the race now you have
to<00:01:52.130> keep<00:01:52.369> your<00:01:52.609> muscle<00:01:52.880> glycogen<00:01:52.999> stores

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600

that in the morning before you go out to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.980 
that in the morning before you go out to
race<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:16.430> actually<00:02:17.240> just<00:02:17.420> train<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.840> want

to make sure that you eat because your

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.649 
to make sure that you eat because your

brain actually uses some of your liver

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.960 
brain actually uses some of your liver
glycogen<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.620> muscle<00:02:21.860> liver<00:02:22.099> glycogen<00:02:22.280> are<00:02:22.760> to

this mental fatigue and we've all felt
this<00:03:26.900> when<00:03:27.319> we're<00:03:27.470> exercising<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.430> again<00:03:29.000> it's
