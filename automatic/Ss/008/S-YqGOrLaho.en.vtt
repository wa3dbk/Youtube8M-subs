00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the hairline is the goal here and the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.849 
the hairline is the goal here and the
focus<00:01:11.450> should<00:01:11.810> be<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.049> keep<00:01:12.320> your<00:01:12.560> pressure

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
roller so the best way to do that is to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.120 
roller so the best way to do that is to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
use that fluid to decompress the neck I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.210
