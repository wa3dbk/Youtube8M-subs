00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.960
 - I'm Juan Carlos and I study Industrial Engineering. - And I'm Emilio and I'm a partner 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.700
 of Industrial Engineering. 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.820
 -I would differentiate it into two general parts. On the one hand, we have an application 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.630
 in the computer generated in Java that works as a recipe for cocktails. That is to say, 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.559
 you can access and you have classified according to different criteria the cocktails, for example 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 according to color, according to ingredients. You can access, see each cocktail what ingredients 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.399
 It takes, how it is prepared and so on. On the other hand, we have the associated machine 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 to this program, what it allows is, in addition to knowing ingredients and preparation, 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.109
 that, simply by pressing a button, that the machine gets 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.250
 in motion and we made this cocktail. So, you can prepare it well manually if 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 you want or if at that time you are not inspired to make your cocktail, simply, 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.910
 By pressing a button, the machine does it for you. 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.780
 - Perhaps the third point would be to enjoy the cocktail, let's say. The important thing is to sit down 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.210
 and enjoy the drink. Once you have done the entire election process and you have 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.310
 the cocktail in your hand, just enjoy. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.120
 - Depends on what is sought. If you are looking for spectacular in terms of using technology 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.370
 For example, using the world of engineering, is a kind of spectacularity. To the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.209
 final it is clear that a machine will never be able to throw bottles in a bar, 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.670
 but, however, it is another type of show to see an electromechanical machine 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.409
 making cocktails that can also have its appeal to a certain type of audience. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.240
 - This subject, the truth, has been an innovation in the way of evaluating. 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.609
 I think all my colleagues have enjoyed developing a project in this subject. 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.599
 - They told you: "You have to develop a project, 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.420
 the only condition that I put to you is that you use a language, in this case Java, do what 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.629
 you want, do it well and present it, and when a certain day arrives, I evaluate 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.549
 your work, your effort and your dedication. " 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.219
 - Yes of course. That is to say, if you think about it, everything is released, that is, the hardware 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:28.590
 as the software is all free, so anyone can take the plane or can take 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.109
 the code and can perform the same function that we have done throughout this 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.189
 draft. That is, you can mount it, you can even modify it if you do not like it, if you consider 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.319
 which is improvable in some aspect, you can use it however you want. 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:58.479
 - In 3 words could be defined as: share, free, as the name says, and economic. 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:04.680
 - Maybe, from another point of view: a little altruism, it could be defined, 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.889
 the fact of creating something and sharing it and making it known to people and that these people can 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.680
 using it also says a lot about the person. We could also define it as 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.579
 something revolutionary, something that already existed but perhaps these years has caught 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.030
 a little more weight, both universities and maybe a little more in life 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.949
 professional. It is free, that is, you do not dedicate yourself to developing it and hiding it, 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:39.039
 but you share it. In the end it is like contributing, a person contributes to the technological development 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.100
 what little he can and what he knows. 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.020
 -All the design of the machine, the shape of the structure, the movement system, 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.650
 the system of the dispensers, electrovalves, all this is also part of a process 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.310
 of design that almost encompassed 70-80% of the whole development of the project, I want 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.610
 to say, then building the machine was a matter of maybe a week or an end of 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.140
 week. 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.960
 - We think of something different from the rest, that is, we approach this challenge from a perspective 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.490
 different, with which from the beginning there was a clear differentiation. 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.080
 -The project is only a prototype, I mean, we want 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.490
 improve the machine, make it more compact, more attractive. And our 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.050
 main idea would be to take it to crowdfunding, for example to platforms like quickstarter, 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.300
 We have seen similar projects to this one. - That they have been very well received and we consider 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.460
 that our project is different, it is different, maybe better or worse, that will be decided by the 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.659
 people but of course it's different, and if we got involved then we have done all the best 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.930
 We have been able to and we believe that it can have a great reception. Have 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.789
 to modify, logically, it has to be made commercial, it has to be an idea 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.199
 commercial. Now it's an effective prototype and you have to get a commercial idea, something 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:14.669
 that is easy to assemble, easy to dismantle, that is fast, that is cheap, 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:21.000
 but of course you can not always get everything, then try to give a balance, but 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.229
 crowdfunding, of course, the most viable option we have considered so far.
