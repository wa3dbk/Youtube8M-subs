00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
change that message so it means

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
different message but just by changing

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.449

one element within that use mnemonics to

the early 20th century who studied
pedigrees<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.620> showed<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:33.030> heredity<00:05:33.840> is

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
pedigrees and showed that heredity is

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.409 
pedigrees and showed that heredity is
particulate<00:05:36.710> before<00:05:37.710> Mendel<00:05:38.070> came<00:05:38.280> along<00:05:38.610> it

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
particulate before Mendel came along it

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.800 
particulate before Mendel came along it
had<00:05:39.660> been<00:05:39.840> thought<00:05:40.140> that<00:05:41.540> male<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:42.570> female

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
had been thought that male and female

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.920 
had been thought that male and female
father<00:05:43.410> and<00:05:43.650> mother<00:05:44.150> blended<00:05:45.150> their<00:05:45.390> effects

father and mother blended their effects

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.740 
father and mother blended their effects
rather<00:05:46.560> like<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.980> might<00:05:47.160> blend<00:05:47.910> two<00:05:48.270> pots<00:05:48.570> of

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
rather like you might blend two pots of

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.270 
rather like you might blend two pots of
paint<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.440> have<00:05:49.560> red<00:05:49.770> paint<00:05:50.040> from<00:05:50.190> the

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
paint that have red paint from the

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.710 
paint that have red paint from the
mother<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.610> blue<00:05:50.940> paint<00:05:51.210> from<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.419> father

mother and blue paint from the father

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.200 
mother and blue paint from the father
and<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:51.960> tipped<00:05:52.770> them<00:05:52.860> together<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.550> do<00:05:54.120> you

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
and you tipped them together and do you

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.860 
and you tipped them together and do you
make<00:05:54.380> purple<00:05:55.380> paint<00:05:55.620> but<00:05:56.550> as<00:05:56.880> it<00:05:57.180> is<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.750> as

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
make purple paint but as it is and as

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.890 
make purple paint but as it is and as
Mendel<00:05:58.200> showed<00:05:59.120> when<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.240> mix<00:06:00.510> the<00:06:00.750> two

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
Mendel showed when you mix the two

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.409 
Mendel showed when you mix the two
parents<00:06:01.350> what<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.830> get<00:06:02.100> is<00:06:02.340> just<00:06:03.120> as<00:06:03.240> much

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
parents what you get is just as much

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.530 
parents what you get is just as much
variation<00:06:04.110> as<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.440> ever<00:06:04.650> had<00:06:04.919> before<00:06:05.540> so

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
variation as you ever had before so

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.680 
variation as you ever had before so
Mendel<00:06:06.930> showed<00:06:07.200> that<00:06:08.060> each<00:06:09.060> parent

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
Mendel showed that each parent

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.780 
Mendel showed that each parent
contributes<00:06:11.270> particles<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.570> heredity<00:06:13.790> like

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
contributes particles of heredity like

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.700 
contributes particles of heredity like
beads<00:06:15.210> like<00:06:16.100> indivisible<00:06:17.100> units<00:06:17.640> these

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
beads like indivisible units these

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.840 
beads like indivisible units these
particles<00:06:19.710> are<00:06:20.150> genes<00:06:21.980> they<00:06:22.980> move<00:06:23.340> through

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
particles are genes they move through

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.440 
particles are genes they move through
the<00:06:24.240> body<00:06:24.560> to<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.650> next<00:06:25.919> generation<00:06:26.520> without

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
the body to the next generation without

the body to the next generation without
blending<00:06:27.900> without<00:06:28.290> mixing<00:06:29.040> they're<00:06:29.250> not<00:06:29.520> like

red paint and blue paint they're like
