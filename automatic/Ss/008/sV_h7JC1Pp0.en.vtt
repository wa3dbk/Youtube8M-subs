00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
pumped because let me give you a few

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.479 
pumped because let me give you a few
reasons<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:51.120> why<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.479> is<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.530> very

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
reasons now why this is actually a very

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.039 
reasons now why this is actually a very
high<00:00:53.850> possibility<00:00:54.530> first<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:55.830> is<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:57.049> it

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
high possibility first thing is that it

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.100 
high possibility first thing is that it
was<00:00:58.680> uh<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.430> announced<00:00:59.790> that<00:01:00.110> Rocksteady

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
was uh it was announced that Rocksteady

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.859 
was uh it was announced that Rocksteady
was<00:01:01.379> looking<00:01:01.979> for<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.339> bunch<00:01:02.549> of<00:01:02.670> people<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.629> you

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
was looking for a bunch of people to you

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.630 
was looking for a bunch of people to you
know<00:01:03.900> higher<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.650> cast<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> things<00:01:05.489> like

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
know higher and cast and things like

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.870 
know higher and cast and things like
that<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.960> unknown<00:01:07.260> secret<00:01:07.979> project<00:01:08.520> set

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that for an unknown secret project set

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.080 
that for an unknown secret project set
to<00:01:09.030> come<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.390> next<00:01:09.750> year<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.909> may<00:01:12.030> think

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
to come out next year now you may think

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.640 
to come out next year now you may think
well<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.600> could<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.810> anything<00:01:13.049> Rocksteady

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
well that could be anything Rocksteady

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
well that could be anything Rocksteady
they<00:01:13.830> work<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.130> plenty<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.850> different<00:01:14.939> stuff

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
they work on plenty of different stuff

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.709 
they work on plenty of different stuff
most<00:01:15.659> likely<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:17.179> when<00:01:18.179> you<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.600> in

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
most likely right but when you put it in

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.779 
most likely right but when you put it in
perspective<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.469> Kevin<00:01:19.859> Conroy<00:01:20.340> had

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
perspective about what Kevin Conroy had

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.609 
perspective about what Kevin Conroy had
tweeted<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.450> long<00:01:21.659> ago<00:01:21.929> where<00:01:22.140> he<00:01:22.170> said<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
tweeted so long ago where he said that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
tweeted so long ago where he said that
he<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.920> working<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.030> next<00:01:24.329> batman<00:01:24.960> arkham

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
he was working on the next batman arkham

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.529 
he was working on the next batman arkham
game<00:01:25.679> for<00:01:25.859> the<00:01:25.920> past<00:01:26.100> nine<00:01:26.340> months<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.450> he

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
game for the past nine months or did he

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:28.989 
game for the past nine months or did he
said<00:01:27.780> nine<00:01:27.960> months<00:01:28.229> something<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.469> that

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
said nine months something like that

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.090 
said nine months something like that
then<00:01:29.999> we<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.560> put<00:01:31.740> into<00:01:31.829> perspective

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
then we can really put into perspective

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910 
then we can really put into perspective
that<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.359> game<00:01:33.630> might<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.929> coming<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.409> lot

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that this game might be coming a lot

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
that this game might be coming a lot
sooner<00:01:35.369> than<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:35.759> expecting<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
sooner than we're expecting and when I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.260 
sooner than we're expecting and when I
say<00:01:39.899> that<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.109> mean<00:01:40.320> why<00:01:41.009> would<00:01:41.249> they<00:01:41.490> bring<00:01:42.030> in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
say that I mean why would they bring in

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
say that I mean why would they bring in
Kevin<00:01:42.630> Conroy<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.409> voice<00:01:43.590> work<00:01:43.890> if

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
Kevin Conroy to do the voice work if

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.109 
Kevin Conroy to do the voice work if
this<00:01:44.460> game<00:01:45.200> hadn't<00:01:46.219> had<00:01:47.219> some<00:01:47.670> sort<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:47.999> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
this game hadn't had some sort of a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.880 
this game hadn't had some sort of a
sooner<00:01:48.539> release<00:01:48.869> date<00:01:49.109> than<00:01:49.319> we<00:01:49.469> initially

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
sooner release date than we initially

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.340 
sooner release date than we initially
thought<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:51.359> be<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:52.319> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
thought that would be like that's what I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
thought that would be like that's what I
think<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> look<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> type<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> news

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
think when I look at this type of news

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.169 
think when I look at this type of news
because<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.039> unless<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.729> mean<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:56.969> not<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
because you know unless I mean I'm not a

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.940 
because you know unless I mean I'm not a
game<00:01:57.359> developer<00:01:57.539> or<00:01:57.899> anything<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
game developer or anything like that of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010 
game developer or anything like that of
course<00:01:59.249> so<00:01:59.969> I<00:01:59.999> really<00:02:00.539> wouldn't<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
course so I really wouldn't know a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
course so I really wouldn't know a
hundred<00:02:01.469> percent<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.850> necessarily

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
hundred percent but I don't necessarily

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.069 
hundred percent but I don't necessarily
think<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.700> calling<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:06.030> somebody<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.929> do

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
think that calling in somebody to do

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.809 
think that calling in somebody to do
voice<00:02:07.380> acting<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.160> game<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.490> not<00:02:08.670> going

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
voice acting for a game that's not going

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.590 
voice acting for a game that's not going
to<00:02:08.910> come<00:02:09.060> out<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.450> another<00:02:09.690> two<00:02:10.590> years<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:11.340> so
