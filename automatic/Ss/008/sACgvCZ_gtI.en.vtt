00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.460
 Naturally 4 Spaniard scoring pass 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.330

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.910

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.530
 goalkeeper 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.600

 zara 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.520
 london canada starts very powerfully 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.750

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.510
 form of fat got the ball on the go 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.460
 meeting with the ladder in the first round and here 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.620
 absolutely reverse situation 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.620
 just two slaps well 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 Well, maybe long ago 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.820
 fuse a little bit your site but this 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.560
 the referee did not notice 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.390
 but this is not the case that got by 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.370
 one cheek, turn the other wanted 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.370
 evertona it happened but 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 snow fox world 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.719
 mother rolls on someone to serve 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.359
 one world I still scores that he 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.600
 did in the penalty area to that of pius turning 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:57.730
 at every opportunity it was not his 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.670
 as it turns out here 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.960
 and even the first such attack is that all 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 passed without a hitch without a hitch 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.610
 Well, the real thorn for the watch was 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.140
 peace pic 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.140
 11 meters to go there 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.150
 smart cut ball 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.439
 Motik Fabregas 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.090
 but it's like 90 minutes and you need a ball 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.349
 run to the end like this with a regatta 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.040
 eyes himself will pierce this bolt this 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.629
 grandmaster goal 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.790
 eden azar this know this is a breakthrough again 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.790
 same basketball hands played 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.090
 autogoal autogoal 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.020
 from Kalman ball from the gate 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.380
 but when he reached and when he didnâ€™t see 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.960
 give back when everton gave up 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.500
 yet because it is not left on the color and fill in 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.420

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.580

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.000
 they fell out fed and gosick down player 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.630
 the basics you are bertone but here it is 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.630
 such is 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.780
 McGeady assists well here in 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.550
 three central chelsea defenders played 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.860
 look and they were all too 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.860
 central and all too together 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.050
 diego costa 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.890
 not the first nor the last stadium where 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.920
 will be booing diego costa 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.680
 match but you can and break through his mother beats 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.560
 and myach grid 42 + 2 catch up again 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.510
 This is the first moment when the motive of the place is 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.370
 my ten-year norm she will have 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.790
 performs today chelsea and rebound to you 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.790
 to help 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.510
 well, very small at all today can 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.130
 be the number of goals so associated with 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:26.580
 just so the baines pitch will go 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.500
 hit name everybody that after all 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:36.110
 43 of hardboard marks its output and 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:40.820
 his debut for everton hunger immediately he 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.810
 carried there to this corner like a loaf 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.780
 see this line which today 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.280
 lined up with such standards and 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.690
 almost from the penalty he struck 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.729
 Layton Baines 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.380
 finally his amazing canopy azar 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.050
 will look for someone's punishment not all 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.440
 They give the same frame 1 match 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.740
 frame 1 time face is visible 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.370
 even though it clocks the clock again + 2 they 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.000
 competing for how long how long and elton 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.000
 Pro will cake 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.680
 package any attack is a goal actually 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.680
 Here in the Premier League is not accepted 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:33.330
 as if we ourselves look at the match Rostov 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.330
 the dynamo is true and the form even matches 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.180
 his first exit for and virtual and this 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:48.180
 output 119 is just what about dubai dubai before 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.180
 63 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.930
 what is that whistles 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.379
 but hang close as there bosnia or 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.129
 Ferencvaros and where he played before that here 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.129
 so center field 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.560
 in general, you don't play like that
