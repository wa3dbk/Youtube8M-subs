need to learn how to carry the ball in

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.850 
need to learn how to carry the ball in
his<00:04:24.480> left<00:04:24.750> some<00:04:24.990> time<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.350> work<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:25.650> other

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
his left some time and work that other

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.520 
his left some time and work that other
step<00:04:26.160> on<00:04:26.370> work<00:04:27.000> your<00:04:27.150> strong<00:04:27.419> hand<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.410> not

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
step on work your strong hand so and not

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.159 
step on work your strong hand so and not
just<00:04:28.740> become<00:04:29.070> one<00:04:29.100> hand<00:04:29.610> one<00:04:29.910> arm<00:04:30.120> dominant<00:04:30.690> so

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
just become one hand one arm dominant so

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.290 
just become one hand one arm dominant so
I<00:04:31.200> think<00:04:31.320> that's<00:04:31.650> really<00:04:32.040> one<00:04:32.400> thing<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.000> would

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
I think that's really one thing I would

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.050 
I think that's really one thing I would
focus<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.930> or<00:04:34.290> emphasize<00:04:34.800> but<00:04:35.640> we're<00:04:35.880> not<00:04:36.030> a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
focus on or emphasize but we're not a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.420 
focus on or emphasize but we're not a
lot<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.300> pressure<00:04:36.630> though

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
lot of pressure though

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.920 
lot of pressure though
don't<00:04:37.610> want<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.850> start<00:04:38.180> pummeling<00:04:38.450> you<00:04:38.780> have

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
don't want to start pummeling you have

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.840 
don't want to start pummeling you have
to<00:04:39.080> carry<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.530> with<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.340> arm<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.670> you're

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.940 
to carry it with the arm that you're
most<00:04:41.000> comfortable<00:04:41.230> but<00:04:42.230> in<00:04:42.380> finding

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
most comfortable but in finding

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.650 
most comfortable but in finding
