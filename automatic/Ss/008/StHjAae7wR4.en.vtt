 you will pass the wire upside down the one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 The wire passed in reverse and pulls as if 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 it was a little inside 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.799

 down the metal work but on top 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 one smaller lower one greater access 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.020
 to do well because this will create a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.810
 angle a round on the collar and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.820

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.070

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.740
 a smaller ball to see how it is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 that makes 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.240
