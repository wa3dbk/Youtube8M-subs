00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.720
 Well 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.720
 here 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000
 so 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.289
 furniture as such prepare 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.780
 we harvest somewhere year somewhere 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.260
 About year bought tanks 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.890
 We are at the center of course the choice of machines 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.190
 big need to notice this before 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.070
 machines are different well, in principle, the price is not 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.400
 this is not available 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.050
 if we talk about quality then if you do 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.629
 quality furniture, I think that 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.900
 Of course you need to take a good machine immediately 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.970
 but we have basically all the machines of the company 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.400
 Filata and already spoke Italian 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.360
 companies to machine tools all of course 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.189
 quality 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.689
 here's a glitch machine yet no edge 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.490
 the seaming machine we start now have 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.049
 we have 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.740
 raskroechny that is it saw our 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.840
 the main thing is that our machine also has a lot 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.060
 good swing 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.159
 also there is a curved machine that is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.680
 we are not only straight parts 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.080
 cook we have and curvilinear 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.390
 enough products in 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.670
 furniture additive machine she became 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.649
 very last half a year very active 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.539
 work here right you know thats all 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.590
 all details are not all 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.530
 presented machines 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.720
 the edge of the mysterious country knu too with me 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.390
 virtually no sky problems 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.340
 first technical parameters first 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.720
 all we were interested in profitability 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.399
 tank that is so that this kilowatt hour 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 electricity consumption was 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.649
 minimum and maximum course 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.069
 production here then me what 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.659
 I liked in this machine that he had 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.239
 big resource i.e. a machine can 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.060
 take as narrow detail as well 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.010
 he has very good detail 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 Here is the figure now that he has 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.980
 decent tank for receiving glue 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.540
 This is also very important because the cream has 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.549
 us in the dry 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.140
 granular state to its 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.420
 need some kind of melt 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.709
 time and it is natural to stop the machine 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 and production loses its power here 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.299
 as the machine has a good volume of 32 liters 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.660
 then it is enough for a decent work time 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.240
 We roll up basically all the details are good 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.280
 such a thick film with we its edge 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.890
 we have it two millimeters as usual 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 and we even roll things that 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.570
 do not roll usually on technology 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.230
 the sky on the production while working pins in 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.180
 two shifts loudly for the card machine he 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.920
 copes in one media we often so 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.990
 it happens that the beer starts to work 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.030
 begin to cut and immediately the details go on 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.560
 riddle and specialists quickly quickly 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.780
 starts to roll because this 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.740
 the moment the saw starts to continue work then 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.670
 we have this here 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.100
 continuous flow 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.050
 all this enters the sex cycle begins 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.730
 collect after additive but before 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.460
 today I want to say again 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.620
 what comments to you as a partner to 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.680
 we will talk to us like that 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.740
 virtually none because you react 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.720
 very quickly trying to help because 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.940
 that you understand that this production 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.160
 we can't stop the machine let's say 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.060
 on the day of this general speech be not 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.280
 it can be quite an experience 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.830
 sell quality products that 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.290
 we are quite satisfied and even more so 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.260
 make a good normal quality 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.800
 service what else do we need more 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.800
 nothing
