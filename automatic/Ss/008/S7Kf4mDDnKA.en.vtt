now<00:00:19.650> despite<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.130> fact<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.550> can't<00:00:20.789> see

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
now despite the fact that you can't see

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.999 
now despite the fact that you can't see
the<00:00:21.269> data<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> hard<00:00:21.900> drive<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.769> still

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
the data on the hard drive it is still

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.759 
the data on the hard drive it is still
there<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.429> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.880> recover<00:00:24.509> it<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.619> is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
there and you can recover it this is

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
there and you can recover it this is
because<00:00:26.070> data<00:00:26.339> is<00:00:26.460> stored<00:00:26.759> on<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> lower

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
because data is stored on the lower

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
because data is stored on the lower
levels<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.810> your<00:00:27.960> memory<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.980> filenames<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
levels of your memory the filenames that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
levels of your memory the filenames that
point<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.329> are<00:00:30.419> gone<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> memory<00:00:31.230> does

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
point to it are gone but the memory does

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
point to it are gone but the memory does
remain<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.340> least<00:00:32.490> temporarily<00:00:33.120> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
remain there at least temporarily the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960 
remain there at least temporarily the
only<00:00:34.140> possible<00:00:34.560> way<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> access<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.820> use

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
only possible way to access it is to use

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.390 
only possible way to access it is to use
specialized<00:00:36.540> software<00:00:36.830> now<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:37.890> catch<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
specialized software now the catch is

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.010 
specialized software now the catch is
that<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.820> overwritten<00:00:39.330> at<00:00:39.510> any<00:00:39.690> time

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
that it can be overwritten at any time

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.590 
that it can be overwritten at any time
because<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:41.010> no<00:00:41.160> protection<00:00:41.580> for<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.090> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
because there's no protection for it so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.640 
because there's no protection for it so
if<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.810> have<00:00:42.900> files<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.380> would<00:00:43.500> like

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
if you have files you would like

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.470 
if you have files you would like
recovered<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.310> would<00:00:44.430> recommend<00:00:44.880> you<00:00:45.000> act<00:00:45.210> as

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
recovered I would recommend you act as

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.050 
recovered I would recommend you act as
quickly<00:00:45.750> as<00:00:46.110> possible<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:47.970> going

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
quickly as possible so what we're going

00:00:48.060 --> 00:01:02.500

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
many of each they find so you just

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.310 
many of each they find so you just
basically<00:02:27.320> run<00:02:28.320> your<00:02:28.500> cursor<00:02:28.680> over<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:30.320> click

as<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.170> recovers<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> file<00:02:41.010> then

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
as you can see it recovers a file then

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420 
as you can see it recovers a file then
puts<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.060> unique<00:02:42.510> folder<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.920> kind<00:02:44.280> of

puts it in a unique folder that kind of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610 
puts it in a unique folder that kind of
neatly<00:02:44.700> stores<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.660> data<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.380> you've
