main purpose of this video and that's
the<00:02:02.620> introduced<00:02:03.280> series<00:02:04.150> of<00:02:04.300> videos<00:02:04.600> that

examines a question whether the Sydney

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.400 
examines a question whether the Sydney
trains<00:02:07.210> rail<00:02:07.480> network<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:08.080> more<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.350> a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
network now the basic distinction

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.690 
network now the basic distinction
between<00:02:13.660> commuter<00:02:14.410> rail<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.830> Rapid<00:02:15.430> Transit

ending up in the suburb of Redfern so

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.050 
ending up in the suburb of Redfern so
roughly<00:05:18.349> every<00:05:18.530> 1/2<00:05:18.919> mile<00:05:19.280> on<00:05:19.460> average<00:05:19.910> you

roughly every 1/2 mile on average you

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.900 
roughly every 1/2 mile on average you
cross<00:05:20.360> into<00:05:20.750> another<00:05:21.020> suburb<00:05:21.380> so<00:05:21.910> essentially

but remember what's a suburb in
Australia<00:05:41.630> is<00:05:41.750> essentially<00:05:42.260> a<00:05:42.289> neighbourhood

Australia is essentially a neighbourhood
