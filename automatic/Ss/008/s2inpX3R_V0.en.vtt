 respective numbers tanaka deals 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 rodrigo supported with flowers is 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.879
 quirós the shot goes out flipped cost no 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.010
 reaches to make contact with the ball 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.600
 it feels like kickback combat was that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 is lit in front no longer nor to the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 who is very skilled or can cow cow 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 down the room played personal of endured 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 full 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 lateral pull that favors Rodrigo 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.399
 flowers is already going for outside to see that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.630
 past movement is the cow shot 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.610
 brava account and no one will be 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.409
 caring they know each other well here is not 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.939
 the best that has warriors than others 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.399
 they are thrown this also careful because it is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.990
 very skillful and hit him held the ball 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.880
 It looks like a deer when it moves 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.110
 inside the court because of the speed that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.939
 has this number 11 and here comes the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 ball is bouncing the reference 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.759
 play come the referees are from saltillo 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.250
 and Ciudad Juárez 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.229
 so arbitration completely neutral 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.049
 and in the chronometer it is like 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.299
 third assistant of tepic nayarit 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.860
 federico Velázquez so also 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.360
 daniela won ramón jiménez completing 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.250
 the arbitration quintet has endured 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 the player plays well 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 have fun Miguel and I'm looking 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.009
 will press off the ball and it will 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 they support even with paul mendoza this 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 player also very important his 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.140
 reincorporation to the squad during 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.850
 injuries was shown as one of the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.959
 strong pillars in the attack the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.759
 sliding Rodrigo that does not fit 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.409
 the ball to the root to the house holds the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.789
 ball inside the area was good the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.649
 placement of the others and that there is no 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.020
 no problem back or looking 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.670
 projects jesús flores este jesús suárez 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.200
 to see before it comes 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.209
 I hope we see it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.340
 Mexican because it showed a great level 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.629
 throughout the league rodrigo flowers that 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.980
 Hold the pressure no longer martínez 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.269
 it seems the referee is missing says he plays 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.890
 we saw for it the displacement not 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.390
 There is nothing I want or that comes out with the ball 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.860
 this man of much experience of 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.290
 a lot of travel within fast football 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.239
 in the country it was always distinguished by its 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920
 great quality but that you will not even have 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.540
 can stick can fight ball or 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.819
 tips the second decade rail be 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
 comfortable the bounce without intention to hold 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.130
 back comes two against one it stops well 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.130
