00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.590
 the architects like all 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.990
 professionals have a role 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.269
 important service to society as well 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 as the doctor cares about health the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.560
 human life the architect instead 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.829
 occupies space 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.759
 this is not often recognized 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:29.430
 because it means taking care of space 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.320
 Necessary space for human life is 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.860
 very important because if I do not have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 space I do not live well and the architect 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.500
 manages space adapts it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.380
 conditions it provides for life 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.260
 not only in a physical way 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.260
 but also spiritual because the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.540
 perception of space many times is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 a psychological thing that creates a state 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.010
 of encouragement and that is handled by the architect 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 also has a whole preparation 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.680
 technique to make possible these 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.739
 cumulative space solutions for the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.650
 human life I think you need 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 architects in all regions of the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 country 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.620
 the great centralism that the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.380
 country for many years has made the 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.180
 best architecture is made in Lima in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.280
 change in the provinces 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.200
 missing architects 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.690
 incompetence is not because there are not 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.810
 there are also you can not know what they are 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.840
 but but it takes more and in fact one 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.820
 can see in public administration to 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.650
 Sometimes there are problems with the development 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.870
 urban problems with the authorization of 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.850
 projects that are not viable or that 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.890
 affect the community and that finally 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.080
 we see they are approved then it is necessary not 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.620
 only people who know architecture 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.380
 let him know that he has good taste but 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.390
 also people who are responsible to the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.940
 time to administer a plan 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.950
 urban development when it comes to making 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.479
 architecture that respects the environment 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.570
 environment when making a 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.920
 architecture that respects the environment and 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.850
 that satisfies above all the needs 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.670
 vital to the human being sometimes the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.599
 architecture for commercial reasons 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.900
 small apartments or homes 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.150
 but the central theme of architecture 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.629
 of the exercise of architecture is the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.569
 human life and that sometimes you do not have 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.760
 so present the most important thing is that the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.080
 university can form people 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.260
 intact 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.070
 and this has a long history 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.960
 making it more than 40 years and what good 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.080
 is needed today also for the 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.690
 architect or the architect not only 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.360
 to be a technician who handles aspects 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.540
 constructive economic but above all 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 he has to be a man who perceives a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.050
 special sensitivity for the human and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.020
 for the social and then this does not 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.600
 improvise requires a long process 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.750
 conscientious training where the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.460
 Values are very important values 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.400
 that the stone university offers 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.580
 they are connected with a vision 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.640
 humanistic of the life of society 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.070
 that enriches 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.760
 the vision of reality to which 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.799
 serves this no no 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.549
 I do not think he is insured in the 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.549
 stone university
