00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

I<00:00:00.210> would<00:00:00.930> think<00:00:01.170> there<00:00:01.949> were<00:00:02.010> two<00:00:02.190> incidents

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
I would think there were two incidents

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.269 
I would think there were two incidents
in<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.850> race<00:00:03.589> obviously<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> first<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.130> was

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
in the race obviously the first one was

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.299 
in the race obviously the first one was
down<00:00:05.490> here<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:05.819> castro<00:00:06.770> when<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.859> course<00:00:08.069> you

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
down here in castro when of course you

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.000 
down here in castro when of course you
got<00:00:08.429> attached<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.510> skated<00:00:10.320> out<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.559> rival<00:00:10.920> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
got attached and skated out the rival to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.249 
got attached and skated out the rival to
get<00:00:11.309> back<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.639> even<00:00:11.910> begging<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:13.080> jim

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
get back on even begging with with jim

get back on even begging with with jim
was<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> pretty<00:00:14.849> tough<00:00:15.120> bang<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> side

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
was that a pretty tough bang on the side

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.099 
was that a pretty tough bang on the side
well<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.850> biggest<00:00:18.300> bang<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> end

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
well the the biggest bang was at the end

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.230 
well the the biggest bang was at the end
of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> strain<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> little<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
of the strain we have a little bit a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.660 
of the strain we have a little bit a
fair<00:00:21.750> bit<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.080> touch<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.560> um<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.920> sort<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
fair bit of a touch but um I sort of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
fair bit of a touch but um I sort of
locked<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.670> tried<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.849> sort<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> hold<00:00:27.990> hold

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
locked up I tried to sort of hold hold

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.529 
locked up I tried to sort of hold hold
my<00:00:28.619> launcher<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.730> sort<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.330> didn't

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
my launcher here but I sort of didn't

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.069 
my launcher here but I sort of didn't
work<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.900> properly<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:32.780> good<00:00:33.780> shot<00:00:34.050> of

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
work out properly but good shot of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.010 
work out properly but good shot of
things<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.559> happen<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.270> but<00:00:36.270> before<00:00:36.840> we'll

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
things can happen and but before we'll

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.410 
things can happen and but before we'll
lock<00:00:37.230> me<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.380> back<00:00:37.680> brakes<00:00:37.980> fairly<00:00:38.760> bad<00:00:38.940> coming

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
lock me up back brakes fairly bad coming

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.800 
lock me up back brakes fairly bad coming
into<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> end<00:00:40.079> corner<00:00:40.530> butter

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
into the end corner butter

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.110 
into the end corner butter
sort<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:42.950> thought<00:00:43.430> we'll<00:00:43.640> run<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.940> place

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
sort of I thought we'll run the place

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.960 
sort of I thought we'll run the place
and<00:00:44.330> going<00:00:44.480> well<00:00:44.720> but<00:00:45.010> things<00:00:46.010> change<00:00:46.310> over<00:00:46.640> a

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
and going well but things change over a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.760 
and going well but things change over a
couple<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.540> seconds<00:00:47.930> conditions<00:00:48.500> must<00:00:48.620> have

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
couple of seconds conditions must have

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.140 
couple of seconds conditions must have
been<00:00:48.860> getting<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.280> bit<00:00:49.580> difficult<00:00:49.790> that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
been getting a bit difficult that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.670 
been getting a bit difficult that
persistent<00:00:50.630> light<00:00:50.750> rain<00:00:51.020> falling<00:00:51.260> as<00:00:51.500> well

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
persistent light rain falling as well

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.590 
persistent light rain falling as well
that's<00:00:52.220> right<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.610> was<00:00:52.640> getting<00:00:53.330> fairly

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
that's right it was getting fairly

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.660 
that's right it was getting fairly
greasy<00:00:54.080> out<00:00:54.170> there<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.710> very<00:00:55.190> slippery<00:00:55.520> on

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
greasy out there and very slippery on

greasy out there and very slippery on
some<00:00:55.910> parts<00:00:56.240> the<00:00:56.300> circuit<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.810> sort<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.110> got

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
some parts the circuit you sort of got

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.490 
some parts the circuit you sort of got
to<00:00:57.830> come<00:00:58.010> up<00:00:58.130> to<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.370> corners<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.910> think<00:00:59.720> half

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
in the Commodore here to be fairly hard

in the Commodore here to be fairly hard
work<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:38.720> think

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
work I think

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.820 
work I think
ties<00:01:41.270> are<00:01:41.300> fairly<00:01:41.690> good<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.350> reckon<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
ties are fairly good but I reckon the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.530 
ties are fairly good but I reckon the
Commodore<00:01:43.220> ties<00:01:43.430> by<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:43.850> starting<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> get

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
Commodore ties by now starting to get

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.470 
Commodore ties by now starting to get
fairly<00:01:44.810> secondhand

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
fairly secondhand

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.710 
fairly secondhand

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
Larry seems to be able to do the best

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.390 
Larry seems to be able to do the best
