kind<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.890> thought<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.130> wanted<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.550> stick<00:02:15.820> with<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
kind of thought I wanted to stick with a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:28.610 
kind of thought I wanted to stick with a
conventional<00:02:18.480> lycoming<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:26.880> an<00:02:27.880> older-style

conventional lycoming or an older-style

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.300 
conventional lycoming or an older-style
what<00:02:29.620> I've<00:02:29.770> seen<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:31.540> built<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.470> pretty

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
what I've seen I built it pretty

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.280 
what I've seen I built it pretty
strictly<00:02:33.760> by<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.030> plans<00:02:34.420> were<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.110> couple

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
strictly by the plans were just a couple

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.560 
strictly by the plans were just a couple
of<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:36.160> changes<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:38.100> motorcycle<00:02:39.100> wheels

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
of little changes the motorcycle wheels

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.530 
of little changes the motorcycle wheels
pretty<00:02:40.570> obvious<00:02:41.459> they're<00:02:42.459> off<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.670> Honda<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
pretty obvious they're off a Honda and

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.510 
pretty obvious they're off a Honda and
then<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.290> little<00:02:45.959> headrest<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:48.400> a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
then the little headrest is just a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.870 
then the little headrest is just a
fiberglass<00:02:49.260> piece<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.620> built<00:02:51.430> up

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.940 

they<00:02:54.270> change<00:02:54.600> they<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:54.960> change<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.590> look<00:02:55.770> of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
they change they do change the look of

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.420 
they change they do change the look of
it<00:02:56.100> quite<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> bit

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
it quite a bit

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.230 
it quite a bit
it's<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.670> Oh<00:02:59.840> 2:35<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.760> stayed<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
it's a Oh 2:35 I stayed with the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.410 
it's a Oh 2:35 I stayed with the
low-compression<00:03:04.430> version<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> could<00:03:06.210> use

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
low-compression version so I could use

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.490 
low-compression version so I could use
the<00:03:06.690> auto<00:03:06.870> fuel<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:08.270> think<00:03:09.270> they're<00:03:09.420> rated<00:03:09.870> at

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the auto fuel I think they're rated at

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.880 
the auto fuel I think they're rated at
105<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.580> underneath<00:03:12.080> horsepower

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
105 or underneath horsepower

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.470 
105 or underneath horsepower
now<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.220> an<00:03:14.490> intonation<00:03:14.790> what's<00:03:15.270> been

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
now is that an intonation what's been

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.690 
now is that an intonation what's been
picked<00:03:15.690> up<00:03:15.780> unison<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.470> hits<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.100> did<00:03:17.400> yeah

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
picked up unison that hits it I did yeah

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.450 
picked up unison that hits it I did yeah
yeah<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:21.000> pieces<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:23.250> had

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
yeah it was it was in pieces and I had

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.020 
yeah it was it was in pieces and I had
some<00:03:23.760> machine<00:03:24.120> work<00:03:24.390> done

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
some machine work done

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:37.290 
some machine work done
together<00:03:31.810> building<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:34.150> building<00:03:35.150> time<00:03:36.110> I

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
together building a building time I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.000 
together building a building time I
think<00:03:38.300> it's<00:03:38.690> like<00:03:38.900> my<00:03:39.110> glass<00:03:39.470> there<00:03:39.770> I've<00:03:39.980> got

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
think it's like my glass there I've got

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.850 
think it's like my glass there I've got
it<00:03:40.340> all<00:03:40.459> recorded<00:03:40.910> but<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.360> never<00:03:41.600> did<00:03:41.900> add<00:03:42.500> it

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
it all recorded but I never did add it

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.410 
it all recorded but I never did add it
the<00:03:43.010> glass<00:03:43.220> there<00:03:43.489> was<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.640> little<00:03:43.910> over<00:03:44.120> three

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
the glass there was a little over three

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.140 
the glass there was a little over three
thousand<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.020> think<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.410> was<00:03:46.270> in<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.540> 2000s

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
thousand I think this was in the 2000s

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.510 
thousand I think this was in the 2000s
some<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.420> changes<00:03:51.080> like<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.739> bumps<00:03:52.340> in

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
some of the changes like the bumps in

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.670 
some of the changes like the bumps in
the<00:03:52.550> cowling<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.480> needed<00:03:53.720> for<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.230> engine

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
the cowling that I needed for the engine

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.309 
the cowling that I needed for the engine
and<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.400> headrest<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:56.750> know<00:03:56.870> anytime<00:03:57.080> you

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
and the headrest you know anytime you

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.370 
and the headrest you know anytime you
change<00:03:58.060> anything<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.510> takes<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.900> lot<00:04:00.050> of<00:04:00.080> extra

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
change anything it takes a lot of extra

you get it up and flying with this

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.720 
you get it up and flying with this
engine<00:04:06.590> what<00:04:06.680> kind<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:06.980> performance<00:04:07.459> you<00:04:07.519> get

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
engine what kind of performance you get

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.699 
engine what kind of performance you get
out<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:08.000> it

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
out of it

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.390 
out of it
real<00:04:09.709> good<00:04:09.890> climb<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:11.750> slow<00:04:12.290> cruise<00:04:12.620> 80<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.610> 85

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
real good climb but slow cruise 80 to 85

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.219 
real good climb but slow cruise 80 to 85
you<00:04:16.400> know<00:04:16.549> there's<00:04:16.790> just<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.209> lot<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.600> drag<00:04:17.959> and

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
you know there's just a lot of drag and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.650 
you know there's just a lot of drag and
that<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.190> airframe<00:04:19.609> in<00:04:19.820> general<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.510> then

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
that in the airframe in general and then

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.610 
that in the airframe in general and then
the<00:04:20.810> round<00:04:20.989> cowl<00:04:21.890> adds<00:04:22.550> drag<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.200> can<00:04:24.440> add

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
the round cowl adds drag so you can add

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.120 
the round cowl adds drag so you can add
lots<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.160> power<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.940> see<00:04:26.479> much<00:04:27.130> much

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
lots of power and not see much much

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:38.530 
lots of power and not see much much
speed<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:35.740> not<00:04:36.740> got<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.610> lot<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.970> compare<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.510> with

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
speed I not got a lot to compare it with

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.100 
speed I not got a lot to compare it with
I<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:40.220> think<00:04:40.970> if<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.150> was<00:04:41.330> pretty<00:04:41.539> docile<00:04:42.430> but

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
I I think if it was pretty docile but

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.719 
I I think if it was pretty docile but
the<00:04:45.110> other<00:04:45.260> side<00:04:45.590> of<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.800> coin<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.490> sort

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
the other side of the coin is it's sort

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.240 
the other side of the coin is it's sort
of<00:04:46.850> blind<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:48.200> way<00:04:48.350> my<00:04:49.030> straps<00:04:50.030> are<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:51.250> can't

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
of blind the way my straps are I can't

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.480 
of blind the way my straps are I can't
lean<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:52.970> whole<00:04:53.360> lot<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.680> as<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:54.979> get<00:04:55.100> into<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
lean a whole lot so as you get into the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.659 
lean a whole lot so as you get into the
three-point<00:04:55.940> attitude<00:04:56.479> it<00:04:56.600> is<00:04:56.750> pretty<00:04:57.229> blind

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
three-point attitude it is pretty blind

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.630 
three-point attitude it is pretty blind
but<00:04:58.669> but<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.210> actual<00:05:00.070> handling<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.280> pretty

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
but but the actual handling is pretty

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.800 
but but the actual handling is pretty
docile<00:05:06.640> standard<00:05:07.640> aircraft<00:05:07.820> fabric<00:05:08.510> covering

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
docile standard aircraft fabric covering

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.090 
docile standard aircraft fabric covering
materials<00:05:09.229> ah<00:05:09.350> yeah<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.490> came<00:05:10.760> with<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.330> steps

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
system

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.730 
system
at<00:05:16.030> least<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.930> basic<00:05:17.650> fabric<00:05:19.560> had<00:05:20.560> to

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
at least the basic fabric had to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.350 
at least the basic fabric had to
purchase<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:22.500> finishing<00:05:23.500> materials<00:05:24.400> but<00:05:25.210> the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
purchase the finishing materials but the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.050 
purchase the finishing materials but the
fabric<00:05:25.870> came<00:05:26.800> with<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.280> airplane<00:05:27.670> and<00:05:27.910> its

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
fabric came with the airplane and its

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.690 
fabric came with the airplane and its
systems

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:47.990 

it<00:05:33.700> was<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.180> steps<00:05:34.830> Polly<00:05:42.510> just<00:05:43.510> shy<00:05:44.410> of<00:05:44.640> 400

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.580 

looks<00:05:49.000> like<00:05:49.740> well<00:05:50.740> it's<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:52.150> get<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:53.020> hang<00:05:53.230> a<00:05:53.380> rib

looks like well it's I get to hang a rib
so<00:05:53.890> it's<00:05:54.040> kept<00:05:54.490> inside<00:06:00.240> lots<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.600> little<00:06:01.960> lunch

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
short range just the 12 gallons what do

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.950 
short range just the 12 gallons what do
you<00:06:20.260> use<00:06:21.420> it's<00:06:22.470> more<00:06:23.470> like<00:06:23.680> 6<00:06:24.010> so<00:06:24.850> it's<00:06:25.600> real

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
you use it's more like 6 so it's real
