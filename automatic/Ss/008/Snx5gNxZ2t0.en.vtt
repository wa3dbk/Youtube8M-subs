00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.890
 bye Bye 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.740
 for the test produced today a prose 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 on chips precisely crik crok not 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 I know if they insist too much but me 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 personally we preferred are the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.669
 spicy cake starts with cones and mustard 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.040
 in short, really brand new I don't have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.620
 not even understood it is a hit 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.739
 made at double taste having it sweet or 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.989
 they are sweet and mixed fries 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 let's say salty 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 in short, truly a novelty now for 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.829
 first sa segada the athletes ingredients 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 as ingredients we find oil potatoes 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.870
 vegetable aromas salt honey powder yes 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.579
 it is not even yellow in acid powder 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.280
 citric and 330 contains milk and derivatives 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.559
 then here we find a vegetable oil 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.299
 vague therefore unfortunately as usual not 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.409
 we know exactly what we are 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 eating 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 this is a 130 gram pack e 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.619
 as an energy value it leads to 532 kcal 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.110
 for 100 g 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.150
 then minute to open 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.520
 who paid a euro fifty 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.310
 first we see the hardness then 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 from the hard we look like pacts and not normal 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.010
 there is an intense smell in particular and vi 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 I also read the appearance do not have 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.890
 a particularly yellow color no 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 keep on feeling no odor not 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 I wish I was cooled but I think 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:57.930
 just not 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 with these we go to find him if you 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.180
 like the pasta you will like 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.960
 certainly because I felt the taste 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.239
 demonstrated is not eaten a mi 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 they will touch another one but I think 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.070
 arrived at this point that is precisely 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.800
 the taste mixed but 1000 sincerely 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:25.020
 not even one heard in the awards another a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:27.890
 case I keep hearing only the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.640
 flavor to set this juxtaposition 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.049
 sweet and sour I really don't feel it 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.390
 so let's go to give some votes for 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.760
 what concerns precisely the idea of 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.769
 mustard honey could be a thing 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 nice if honey felt like a 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.910
 a little bit more so I'm not 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.340
 particularly happy because in the end 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.130
 there are mustard chips 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.650
 many are good absolutely have 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.049
 just taste if you like you can 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.840
 quietly buy but can't find 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.820
 This great diversity and other 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.079
 so my vote in this case is one 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.519
 enough 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.220
 I hope you find this review useful 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.990
 a kiss to all and see you on Saturday 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.370

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.150
 channel with the new recipe and now 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.460

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.610
