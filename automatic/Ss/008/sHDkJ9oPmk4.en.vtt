I hope you hope in the future to make a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.050 
I hope you hope in the future to make a
tutorial<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.150> model<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
tutorial for this model but it is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:29.510 
tutorial for this model but it is
difficult<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:17.540> take<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:19.640> lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> time

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.430 

right<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.690> another<00:01:32.030> big<00:01:33.030> 20<00:01:34.020> origami

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
right this is another big 20 origami

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.040 
right this is another big 20 origami
model<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> 3d<00:01:35.820> yummy<00:01:36.650> right<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:39.050> this

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
model this is a 3d yummy right and this

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.030 
model this is a 3d yummy right and this
is<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.820> entirely<00:01:41.820> finished<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> hope<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
is not entirely finished but I hope I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.690 
is not entirely finished but I hope I
can<00:01:44.490> finish<00:01:45.650> next<00:01:46.650> two<00:01:47.580> or<00:01:47.700> three<00:01:47.729> weeks<00:01:49.700> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
can finish next two or three weeks this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
can finish next two or three weeks this
is<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.940> very<00:01:51.360> large<00:01:51.659> model<00:01:52.320> too

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
is a very large model too

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.580 
is a very large model too
this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.580> made<00:01:53.850> from<00:01:54.149> around<00:01:56.210> 300,000<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.590> 500

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
this is made from around 300,000 and 500

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.690 
this is made from around 300,000 and 500
pieces<00:01:59.570> here<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:01.850> big<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.350> small<00:02:04.350> pieces

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.640 

this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:10.320> very<00:02:10.979> complex<00:02:11.640> model<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:13.350> hope

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this is a very complex model and I hope

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.050 
this is a very complex model and I hope
in<00:02:13.920> future<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:15.680> make<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> tutorial<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.850> this

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
in future to make a tutorial for this

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.509 
in future to make a tutorial for this
model<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:20.120> make<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.480> video<00:02:21.810> only<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:23.010> show<00:02:23.459> you

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
model I make this video only to show you

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.120 
model I make this video only to show you
that<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.239> do<00:02:24.300> not<00:02:24.570> stop<00:02:24.900> you're<00:02:25.260> creating<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
that I do not stop you're creating the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.540 
that I do not stop you're creating the
3d<00:02:26.600> models<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.720> make<00:02:30.720> less<00:02:31.280> tutorial<00:02:32.280> in

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
3d models but I make less tutorial in

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.650 
3d models but I make less tutorial in
future<00:02:33.209> because<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.769> models<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.489> bigger<00:02:36.329> and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
future because the models are bigger and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.720 
future because the models are bigger and
more<00:02:36.799> complex<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.660> take<00:02:39.660> more<00:02:40.350> time<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.910> make

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
more complex and take more time to make

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.930 
more complex and take more time to make
okay

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
okay

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.949 
okay
and<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> lot<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.790> work<00:02:48.090> behind<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
and it is a lot of work behind this

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.550 
and it is a lot of work behind this
model<00:02:49.610> because<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:51.120> worked<00:02:51.630> by<00:02:52.110> new<00:02:52.880> trying<00:02:53.880> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
model because I worked by new trying and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.330 
model because I worked by new trying and
trying<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.220> trying<00:02:57.200> until<00:02:58.310> I'm<00:03:01.340> satisfied

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
trying and trying until I'm satisfied

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.060 
trying and trying until I'm satisfied
with<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.720> model<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:05.660> among<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:07.290> lot<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.769> pieces

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
with the model and among a lot of pieces

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.150 
with the model and among a lot of pieces
in<00:03:08.489> this<00:03:08.730> process<00:03:10.850> must<00:03:11.850> say<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.500> a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
in this process must say that for a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.229 
in this process must say that for a
model<00:03:14.910> made<00:03:15.570> made<00:03:16.140> from<00:03:16.620> around<00:03:17.040> 500<00:03:17.970> pieces

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
model made made from around 500 pieces

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.970 
model made made from around 500 pieces
right<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:19.820> more<00:03:20.820> than<00:03:21.150> 2,000<00:03:22.049> pieces<00:03:22.320> for

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
right now more than 2,000 pieces for

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.000 
right now more than 2,000 pieces for
creating<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:25.290> model<00:03:25.739> right<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.709> all

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
creating that model right this is all

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.009 
creating that model right this is all
for<00:03:29.459> today<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.239> hope<00:03:30.359> in<00:03:32.720> 5<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.750> 10<00:03:34.320> days<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:35.130> make

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
for today I hope in 5 of 10 days to make

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.030 
for today I hope in 5 of 10 days to make
another<00:03:37.019> tutorial<00:03:38.269> have<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> nice<00:03:39.600> day

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
