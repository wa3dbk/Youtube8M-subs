conference then my rules for auditioning
are<00:01:37.360> very<00:01:37.540> similar<00:01:37.870> because<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.650> seems<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
are very similar because it seems to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.940 
are very similar because it seems to
work<00:01:39.190> for<00:01:39.340> them<00:01:39.460> right<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:40.710> video<00:01:41.710> should<00:01:41.860> be

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
work for them right so video should be

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.070 
work for them right so video should be
around<00:01:42.670> five<00:01:42.910> minutes<00:01:43.270> not<00:01:43.450> too<00:01:43.630> much<00:01:43.750> under

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
around five minutes not too much under

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.020 
around five minutes not too much under
or<00:01:44.200> too<00:01:44.320> much<00:01:44.470> over<00:01:44.650> because<00:01:45.010> I<00:01:45.220> want<00:01:45.430> enough

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
or too much over because I want enough

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.420 
or too much over because I want enough
to<00:01:46.270> see<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:47.830> can<00:01:48.010> act<00:01:48.160> like<00:01:48.220> the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
to see that you can act like the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.090 
to see that you can act like the
character<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.120> I<00:01:49.600> also<00:01:50.560> don't<00:01:50.800> want<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.040> be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
character and I also don't want to be

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.040 
character and I also don't want to be
watching<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.520> really<00:01:51.970> really<00:01:52.150> long<00:01:52.420> video<00:01:52.690> if

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
watching a really really long video if

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.680 
watching a really really long video if
it's<00:01:53.200> not<00:01:53.380> necessary<00:01:53.979> if<00:01:54.250> your<00:01:55.240> character<00:01:55.660> has

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
it's not necessary if your character has

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.560 
it's not necessary if your character has
an<00:01:56.020> official<00:01:56.259> genderbend<00:01:56.890> use<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.119> i'll

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
an official genderbend use that and i'll

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.030 
an official genderbend use that and i'll

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
if you don't have the accent you can
