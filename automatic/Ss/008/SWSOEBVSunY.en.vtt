00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello themselves frost and today we 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.460
 let's stay a little predator for today 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.769
 mod adds these here are wonderful 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.630
 bright yellow hives and these 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.240
 beautiful bees though not a bit 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.150
 square more precisely all square but all 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 equally they are funny and we can find 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 several species or in which at first 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 look like two drops of water and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.250
 second look they look like two drops 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.880
 waters because they have only 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.439
 different functions this is the usual home hive 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
 which we can do with our own hands 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.800
 But according to this recipe, is it dequeue? 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.329
 which we can find in the wild 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 hanging tree here in a similar way 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.200
 so what do we do we found this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.160
 hive actually we only have 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
 several choices 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.800
 go home empty-handed and on 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.320
 suck paw or pillage this hive 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 kill all the bees and make 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.559
 own apiary most likely we 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.260
 let's do the second option 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 so we take the break from does not fall out 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 our valuable wax which is necessary for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.729
 making our home apiary and faster 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.790
 turn on the creative so that we are not devoured 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.040
 bees who are very unhappy that i 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.070
 destroyed their house in whatever way we can 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 kill of them falls pieces of honey from 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.659
 which can be done later 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 vedrova honey and again 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.299
 and wax may fall from them but you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.159
 rather rarely 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.229
 on with bits of honey give yours 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.560
 last does not want to give well, okay 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.590
 let her choke 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.870
 resources itself and we will make our own 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.820
 apiary 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.680
 so far these little bees are perfect 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.700
 harmless and can not cause us 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.690
 no harm 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 but in the future the author promises to add and 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.850
 sounds of flying in than more products from 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.470
 honey and of course make bees 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.630
 aggressive not for nothing to add 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.250
 equipment on a predator which is on 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.210
 this moment has no meaning 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 because the same leather armor only 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 with a unique craft and with a unique 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.830
 a helmet with a grille does it all 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.810
 in this way from the web of skin well and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 helmet from the lattice to not eat us 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 bit the bees 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.350
 well, so far they have been doing this and cannot 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:23.100
 vest pants and boots and it will need 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.920
 your Putin who has not found enough 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.700
 number of cows to make yourself 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.270
 good armor 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.170
 but he has a lot of spiders and this 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.560
 armor can not be painted and so we did 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.180
 our apiary what do we do with it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.580
 Of course we can prevent not have 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.489
 how to do it is very easy to take 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.180
 bucket come to our apiary and say 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.690
 bees 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.700
 well yes yes Lebanese quickly honey and we hear 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.040
 what's coming from there went ass and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 will have to act the very approach and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.570
 defiantly take honey from them and we have whole 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.940
 bucket honey run away from there faster we 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.950
 we can have you and he will restore us 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.800
 just some miserable one and a half 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.570
 units of hunger or we can from it 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.269
 for example something to craft for example 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.920
 make it a sandwich which is already in 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.450
 turn restore as many as five 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.540
 units of hunger that's pretty 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.910
 impressively we can make a liquid of it 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.980
 honey splitting it up with just one 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.780
 a bucket of water one by one so fine 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.900
 breeding lived all shove in small 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.030
 a test tube which is not a simple magic 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.140
 which will tell a little later or 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.330
 make a bait for 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.490
 bees which is also done a little 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.580
 another method like this here and here 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.280
 so that's what it is for when we 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.490
 made your own hive for example here we are 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.400
 he made him out turns out 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.860
 several bees 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.950
 base set so to speak and let's say we 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.080
 want more we put them food they 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.120
 begin to mate quickly and makes us 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.400
 new bees make more bees they 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 pleases our eyes or 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.180
 our eyes fall in general they all 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.340
 love to do it and go on next 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.480
 we have a unique torch in turn 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.190
 which is made from wax and cobwebs 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.100
 it also shines like a normal torch 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.480
 the only thing he is interested in is 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.270
 unusual texture which is pretty 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.550
 bright and fun for those who want 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.950
 change several torch settings 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.830
 dilute your trash 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.180
 that's how it looks pretty pretty 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.000
 cool though could come up 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.490
 anything better and last that we have 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.610
 it remains to untie our honey 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:44.410
 which we can drink and he will give us 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.910
 magic properties form of acceleration now 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.860
 we drink it and 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.230
 he will be action in as little as 20 seconds i 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.510
 I do not understand why it was added now 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.270
 on the right our mine though as mine 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.640
 some kind of simple man and we can faster 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.160
 digging an ordinary pickaxe with a pickaxe and 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.010
 shovel anything else we work faster 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.740
 we will not move in the same way and it 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.780
 lasts only 20 seconds in my opinion 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.300
 this is delusional added this only for 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.210
 order to be 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.340
 I hope this will be fixed in the next series. 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.050
 future versions will fix and maybe 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.970
 at least make a minute then this 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.550
 Well, it made sense to Che so now I have to seconds 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.810
 run to the mine to went for 20 seconds 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.820
 faster until over 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.450
 besides these bottles of liquid honey are not 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.240
 stack up stokke 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.800
 well, that's why I have everything with you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.810
 in frost subscribe rate 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.810
 comment good luck to everyone bye
