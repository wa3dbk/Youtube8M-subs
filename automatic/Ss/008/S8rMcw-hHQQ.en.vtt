00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello my dear, I was shopping 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.679
 I already had one yesterday 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 small question on angeles at 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.009
 facebook like that looks like we do it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.049
 have experience and if so like that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.820
 because it looks like that 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 many have not tested yet 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.170
 but those who did this are probably very 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.970
 say it is easy to say 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.289
 it is not difficult to learn 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.019
 There is great guidance to do it 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.019
 allegedly all of them 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:42.410
 Knitted pattern that you know so well you can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.410
 actually lure it 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.309
 yes, how does that compound knocking 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.690
 is clearly holding up hagen von 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:01.440
 Crochet hook and not from knitting on 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.619
 english then only children come out yes 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.540
 now you should flag yourself a helper 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.130
 through these interiors these needles 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.930
 have a rear 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.700
 That's the only thing different 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.250
 otherwise this crochet hook is quite it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 normal to the back of this or should you 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.060
 a twice as long threadlike 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.509
 pull in like that like the booking piece 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.520
 The width should be wider later 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.030
 if you have 30 centimeters wider 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 you need to drive 60 centimeters 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.380
 I had doubled here now 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.909
 you do not think twice 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 I paid for the whole six 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.840
 I think it's not too much 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.409
 that is quite a lot many 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 other new things are leaving you 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.049
 pay much more expensive I think so 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.049
 going 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.729
 if you do not necessarily have the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.229
 dealers around the corner or somehow 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.030
 then and try it to talk 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.159
 there you can see its internet address 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 as you can that determines the bomb 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.640
 order the names 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.780
 write it down or somehow like that 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.630
 I only have it in four now 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.099
 millimeters 6 mm found 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.069
 that's the six millimeter I suppose 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.870
 but now the thinner because I have none 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.840
 and then you should 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 if you have this thread in the back office 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 sound as always right on the right one should 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.069
 quite normal the stop you make 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.200
 otherwise it also makes for the air masses 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.970
 chain should be quite normal the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:54.190
 air masses to 10 12 34 depending on how 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:58.510
 many one just needs ne 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.860
 So annan you should not like this up here 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.500
 we would do now in the mesh 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.250
 plug in again but you should be 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.019
 Turn the air mass chain and back 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.900
 in the transverse again 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:16.120
 prick 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:22.329
 So yes, we stand times when a number 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.739
 One, it's a little bit a bit 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.790
 profession if you know it differently then then 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.150
 you have to look a bit unusual 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.380
 but live with it 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.670
 and then you get the thread through and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.620
 let him on the needle too 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.359
 does not pull the thread somehow now 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.780
 again through or so one lets him 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:43.030
 simply place it in the stands 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.859
 next little cross man the man 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.989
 has crocheted pulls there again the names 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.880
 through and then has the third above 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.200
 then you go to the next one 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.109
 the next thread through the next 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.100
 little bridge my goodness me a bit 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:02.790
 made tight again I believe the thread 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.790
 pull through 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.250
 then again by a bridge yes I have 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:21.209
 Too tight crochet very clear thing 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:23.970
 The note I guess now reasonably 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.590
 all of them are the same height later 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:34.800
 a uniform picture is natural 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:36.230
 only then next there is again 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.410
 prick 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:46.169
 if I come in then know that neither 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.270
 pick up a loop and then 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.160
 If you want to be at the bottom of the page 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.800
 you have arrived 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.430
 pull this thread in the mesh 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:05.490
 then she lies there in it 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:07.020
 yes and then the whole one is sent 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.400
 just pick up the claim 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.560
 the needle and then crochets back to the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.990
 you get back through thread 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.390
 I can show them the first places 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:25.080
 you have so on the stands in the second 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:29.789
 is a grab the thread again fruit 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.440
 or pick up the thread and have 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.680
 then already two stitches often assumption 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.169
 are the same again the next time 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.169
 then picks up the thread again 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.380
 3 again and if the series too 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:53.580
 end is when you come back to the end 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:55.729
 arrived I always make up to 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.729
 The End 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:07.210
 then you pull yourself down the thread 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:10.050
 out of the other stitches and then 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.490
 you can see the needle on top again 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.270
 so that the auxiliary thread back into the 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.270
 mesh lies 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.940
 and so it goes back and forth and 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.940
 here and there until sometime 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.160
 then arrived where you want to go 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.010
 I'm going with safety times the one 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.700
 or others try one or the other 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.380
 let's show if you would like that 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.720
 So you can write me a combo 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.700
 either here or on facebook or how 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.130
 whatever you want you can 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.750
 sign up and then I'll show you 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.590
 maybe two little things like that 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.690
 few starter stories 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:55.050
 otherwise yes I think they look great 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:57.940
 from quite normal metal needles so 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.160
 Price is synonymous find I can with you 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.180
 Life 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.860
 otherwise you do not need a special one 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.080
 tool in addition or one man 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.270
 just needs this help thread and 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.280
 it really is like that now 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.640
 first time the very first time that me 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.080
 that has done now that is 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.400
 Pill trap that's super easy 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:22.240
 really it is super easy and you can see 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.580
 here only after the first row is 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.700
 really rather knitted than crocheted 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.220
 and there is a wonderful one down here 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.100
 At the end of her studies, she was very well acquainted with it 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.780
 is not so happy with me 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.670
 can be a bit uneven 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:40.170
 or something like that you have here then 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.760
 not looking great 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.070
 I think that could already be certain 

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.010
 bring fun and addiction with it 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.790
 but we'll wait and see how that happens 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.800
 to pretend 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.930
 I just wanted to show you I 've got it 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.570
 she and I will deal with it 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.220
 argue and yes as I said if 

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.810
 you want to show I like you there 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.230
 maybe one 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.660
 Two things just write me and then 

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.190
 Can we do this 

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.889
 Until then, I wish you a nice 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.650
 day here the sun is boxing 

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:12.450
 bit through the gray but really 

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.320
 It does not only get warmer 

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.570
 summer is over 

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:19.220
 so it makes you beautiful colorful at home 

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.220
 and thank you
