00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
yo guys spread about here welcome to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.550 
yo guys spread about here welcome to
step<00:00:12.570> number<00:00:12.630> 24<00:00:13.230> here<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.650> our<00:00:14.719> transits<00:00:15.719> road

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
step number 24 here on our transits road

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.960 
step number 24 here on our transits road
to<00:00:16.950> the<00:00:17.430> ultimate<00:00:18.080> secret<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.610> don't<00:00:20.610> know<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to the ultimate secret I don't know I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
to the ultimate secret I don't know I
don't<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.540> we're<00:00:22.230> doing<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> doctor<00:00:23.250> Max's

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
don't know we're doing the doctor Max's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.060 
don't know we're doing the doctor Max's
side<00:00:24.000> we've<00:00:24.840> already<00:00:25.020> completed<00:00:25.439> Richthofen

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
side we've already completed Richthofen

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.229 
side we've already completed Richthofen
so<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.970> next<00:00:27.000> step<00:00:27.329> for<00:00:27.450> doctor<00:00:28.380> Maxis<00:00:28.919> is<00:00:29.239> to

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
so the next step for doctor Maxis is to

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.950 
so the next step for doctor Maxis is to
capture<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:31.079> kill<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.489> Avogadro<00:00:33.450> guy<00:00:33.600> with

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
capture or kill that Avogadro guy with

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.860 
capture or kill that Avogadro guy with
an<00:00:34.410> EMP<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.820> has<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> pylon<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
an EMP and it has to be at the pylon and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.920 
an EMP and it has to be at the pylon and
we<00:00:37.469> also<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.780> couple<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
we also have to have a couple of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.619 
we also have to have a couple of
turbines<00:00:40.410> running<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.579> power<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.210> obelisk

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
turbines running to power the obelisk

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
turbines running to power the obelisk
the<00:00:42.870> obelisk<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> card<00:00:44.100> reader

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the obelisk is like the card reader

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
the obelisk is like the card reader
table<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.050> we're<00:00:46.199> doing<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.620> we're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
table so what we're doing here we're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.579 
table so what we're doing here we're
just<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.059> restarted<00:00:48.629> again<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.440> can

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
just you know we restarted again we can

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.410 
just you know we restarted again we can
do<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.129> early<00:00:50.370> rounds<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.210> use

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
do this at early rounds because we use

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.110 
do this at early rounds because we use
money<00:00:51.749> from<00:00:51.870> our<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.499> our<00:00:52.620> bank<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
money from our from our bank to get it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.770 
money from our from our bank to get it
so<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.539> player<00:00:55.260> needs<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.239> EMPs<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> I'm

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
so one player needs to have EMPs and I'm

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
so one player needs to have EMPs and I'm
the<00:00:57.929> one<00:00:58.079> who<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:58.769> I<00:00:58.920> believe<00:00:59.399> axel<00:00:59.789> does

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the one who has them I believe axel does

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.229 
the one who has them I believe axel does
but<00:01:00.269> we've<00:01:00.989> assigned<00:01:01.379> roles<00:01:01.769> or<00:01:02.100> positions<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but we've assigned roles or positions to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.940 
but we've assigned roles or positions to
to<00:01:03.960> each<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.010> each<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.970> us<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.409> two<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.830> i

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to each of each of us and two of them i

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
to each of each of us and two of them i
believe<00:01:08.220> axle<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> hyper<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.810> actually

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
believe axle and hyper are to actually

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.910 
believe axle and hyper are to actually
put<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.400> turbines<00:01:11.970> directly<00:01:12.780> beside<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
put the turbines directly beside the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.720 
put the turbines directly beside the
obelisk<00:01:14.340> table<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.410> then<00:01:16.410> we<00:01:16.980> got<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> draw<00:01:17.490> in

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
obelisk table and then we got to draw in

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.180 
obelisk table and then we got to draw in
the<00:01:17.940> avogadro<00:01:18.660> we<00:01:19.410> got<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> draw<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
the avogadro we got to draw in the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.090 
the avogadro we got to draw in the
electric<00:01:20.580> man<00:01:20.790> into<00:01:21.770> within<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.980> vicinity

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
electric man into within the vicinity

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670 
electric man into within the vicinity
under<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.850> pylon<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:25.050> hit<00:01:25.320> him<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.470> an

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
under the pylon and then hit him with an

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.670 
under the pylon and then hit him with an
EMP<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.940> should<00:01:27.240> should<00:01:28.170> complete<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
EMP and that should should complete the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240 
EMP and that should should complete the
next<00:01:28.920> step<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.340> dr.<00:01:30.150> Max's<00:01:30.570> aside<00:01:31.010> so<00:01:32.010> why<00:01:32.190> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
next step for dr. Max's aside so why the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
next step for dr. Max's aside so why the
avogadro<00:01:33.000> has<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.750> spawned<00:01:34.050> in<00:01:34.200> he

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
avogadro has actually spawned in he

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.290 
avogadro has actually spawned in he
usually<00:01:34.470> does<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.980> just<00:01:35.550> before<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> start<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
usually does it just before the start of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.570 
usually does it just before the start of
a<00:01:36.420> round<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:37.440> he's<00:01:37.620> going<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.920> spawn<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.430> right

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
a round or he's going to spawn in right

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.680 
a round or he's going to spawn in right
now<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:39.860> man<00:01:40.860> killer<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:41.520> hyper<00:01:42.300> mall<00:01:42.510> going

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
now and man killer and hyper mall going

00:01:42.690 --> 00:02:00.109 
now and man killer and hyper mall going
to<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:42.870> their<00:01:42.990> turbines<00:01:43.380> down

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.850 

all<00:02:01.119> rights<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.510> access<00:02:01.720> was<00:02:02.140> saying<00:02:02.409> hey<00:02:02.650> we

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
all rights of access was saying hey we

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.530 
all rights of access was saying hey we
need<00:02:02.979> more<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:03.610> need<00:02:03.760> more<00:02:03.909> power<00:02:04.150> and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
need more of it we need more power and

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.540 
need more of it we need more power and
it's<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.380> still<00:02:05.650> kind<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.950> difficult<00:02:06.400> even

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
it's it's still kind of difficult even

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.699 
it's it's still kind of difficult even
around<00:02:06.880> five<00:02:07.270> when<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.570> sky<00:02:07.900> starts<00:02:08.170> zapping

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
around five when the sky starts zapping

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.520 
around five when the sky starts zapping
you<00:02:08.860> we're<00:02:09.610> trying<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.970> get<00:02:10.179> him<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.780> under<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you we're trying to get him in under the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
you we're trying to get him in under the
pylon<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.069> he's<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:12.819> outside<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.350> area

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
pylon and he's just outside of the area

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.510 
pylon and he's just outside of the area
if<00:02:16.569> we<00:02:16.690> hit<00:02:16.780> him<00:02:16.930> with<00:02:17.020> an<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.230> EMP<00:02:17.620> now<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.340> might

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
if we hit him with an a EMP now it might

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.059 
if we hit him with an a EMP now it might
actually<00:02:18.790> work<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.319> wanted<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.800> get<00:02:20.920> it

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
actually work but we wanted to get it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.100 
actually work but we wanted to get it
right<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.489> then<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.239> throw<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> MP<00:02:22.900> right

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
right and then we throw the MP right

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.240 
right and then we throw the MP right
there<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.239> we<00:02:28.540> do<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.140> Max<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.070> hey

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
there so we do that and Max is like hey

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.570 
there so we do that and Max is like hey
we<00:02:30.400> need<00:02:30.519> more<00:02:30.700> energy<00:02:30.880> all<00:02:31.840> right<00:02:32.550> what<00:02:33.550> the
