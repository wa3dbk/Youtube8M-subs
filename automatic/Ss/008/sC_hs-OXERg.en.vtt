00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.499 

the<00:00:10.510> point<00:00:10.809> of<00:00:10.990> the<00:00:11.139> circles<00:00:11.769> and<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.219> aides

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the point of the circles and the aides

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.999 
the point of the circles and the aides
the<00:00:13.509> big<00:00:13.690> aides<00:00:13.870> of<00:00:14.080> it<00:00:14.230> legs<00:00:14.469> of<00:00:14.920> the

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
the big aides of it legs of the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.870 
the big aides of it legs of the
diagonals<00:00:15.670> where<00:00:16.599> do<00:00:16.779> you<00:00:16.869> want<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.140> do<00:00:17.290> this

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
diagonals where do you want to do this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.179 
diagonals where do you want to do this
it's<00:00:18.880> like<00:00:19.000> you're<00:00:19.210> putting<00:00:19.420> furrows<00:00:19.990> in<00:00:20.260> with

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
it's like you're putting furrows in with

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.670 
it's like you're putting furrows in with
the<00:00:21.310> circles<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.289> then<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.500> eggs

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
the circles and then the eggs

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.590 
the circles and then the eggs
overlapping<00:00:24.250> circles<00:00:24.580> and<00:00:25.029> take<00:00:25.210> off<00:00:25.420> the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
overlapping circles and take off the

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.120 
overlapping circles and take off the
highs<00:00:25.779> that<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:26.199> left<00:00:28.680> charged<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:29.920> thing

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
highs that it left charged the thing

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.350 
highs that it left charged the thing
right<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:36.219> it<00:00:36.340> said<00:00:36.610> that<00:00:36.640> that's<00:00:36.910> one<00:00:37.180> of<00:00:37.270> the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
right and it said that that's one of the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.270 
right and it said that that's one of the
hardest<00:00:37.690> part<00:00:37.960> of<00:00:38.170> much<00:00:38.350> polishing<00:00:38.860> knowing

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
hardest part of much polishing knowing

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.819 
hardest part of much polishing knowing
when<00:00:39.489> that's<00:00:39.730> charged<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:41.170> I<00:00:41.290> think<00:00:41.530> when<00:00:41.710> you

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
when that's charged and I think when you

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.010 
when that's charged and I think when you
charge<00:00:42.100> it<00:00:42.250> from<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.520> inside<00:00:43.000> it's<00:00:43.750> a<00:00:43.809> little

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
charge it from the inside it's a little

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.410 
charge it from the inside it's a little
bit<00:00:44.170> more<00:00:44.320> hit<00:00:44.590> and<00:00:44.739> miss<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.969> you're<00:00:46.120> doing

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
bit more hit and miss what you're doing

00:00:46.420 --> 00:01:09.999 
bit more hit and miss what you're doing
this<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> quite<00:00:47.050> good<00:00:47.320> way<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.590> start<00:00:47.950> off

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.680 

again<00:01:12.350> there's<00:01:13.350> some<00:01:13.530> debate<00:01:13.890> over<00:01:14.450> which<00:01:15.450> oil

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
again there's some debate over which oil

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.260 
again there's some debate over which oil
is<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> best<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> baby<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.520> olive

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
is the best is it baby or is it olive

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.850 
is the best is it baby or is it olive
oil<00:01:21.479> virgin<00:01:22.080> oil<00:01:24.170> thank<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.409> seems<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
oil virgin oil thank you all seems to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:37.880 
oil virgin oil thank you all seems to
work<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:31.310> again<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> you're<00:01:37.740> pushing

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
work for me again so you're pushing

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
work for me again so you're pushing
pretty<00:01:38.220> hard<00:01:40.820> yeah<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> mean<00:01:42.090> I've<00:01:42.240> said<00:01:42.479> like

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
pretty hard yeah I mean I've said like

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
pretty hard yeah I mean I've said like
press<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.229> oven<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.039> might<00:01:44.190> change

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
press your oven I think I might change

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.570 
press your oven I think I might change
that<00:01:46.100> moderate<00:01:47.100> pressure<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:48.289> mean<00:01:49.289> as<00:01:49.440> the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
that moderate pressure I mean as the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.090 
that moderate pressure I mean as the
Polish<00:01:50.580> thickens<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:52.560> increase<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
Polish thickens you increase the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.380 
Polish thickens you increase the
pressure<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:53.819> be<00:01:53.940> action<00:01:54.210> because

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
pressure that would be action because

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.960 
pressure that would be action because
you're<00:01:54.509> trying<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> flatten<00:01:55.289> out<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> surface

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.729 

can<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> haze<00:02:02.000> behind<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.179> rubber<00:02:03.739> if

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:04.739 
can you see a haze behind the rubber if

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:14.150 
can you see a haze behind the rubber if
you<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.440> Polish<00:02:07.440> evaporating<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.920> it's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
you see the Polish evaporating and it's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.199 
you see the Polish evaporating and it's
only<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:15.060> determine<00:02:15.560> how<00:02:16.560> long<00:02:17.209> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
only you that can determine how long you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.320 
only you that can determine how long you
can<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.750> score<00:02:19.610> when<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> rubber<00:02:20.879> becomes

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
can do the score when the rubber becomes

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.600 
can do the score when the rubber becomes
dry<00:02:22.400> will<00:02:23.400> feel<00:02:23.610> more<00:02:23.790> friction<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.370> can

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
dry will feel more friction so you can

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.180 
dry will feel more friction so you can
press<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.849> little<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.239> harder<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.810> like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
press a little bit harder if you like

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.310 
press a little bit harder if you like
free<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.340> some<00:02:29.550> more<00:02:30.620> alcohol<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.280 

let's<00:02:38.320> fix<00:02:38.680> tourist<00:02:39.190> if<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.550> stop<00:02:40.290> what

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
let's fix tourist if you stop what

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.640 
let's fix tourist if you stop what
starts<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.860> dry<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.630> can<00:02:43.810> over<00:02:44.500> they

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
starts to dry then you can over they

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.130 
starts to dry then you can over they
like<00:02:44.830> mess
