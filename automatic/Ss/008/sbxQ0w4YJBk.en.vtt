00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
with the players so the key for him in

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.889 
with the players so the key for him in
what<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.579> try<00:01:22.819> to<00:01:22.850> tell<00:01:22.999> them<00:01:23.149> is<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.600> know<00:01:23.689> just

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
what I try to tell them is you know just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.410 
what I try to tell them is you know just
go<00:01:24.740> do<00:01:24.950> all<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.189> things<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.579> do<00:01:25.850> so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
go do all the things that you do so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.789 
go do all the things that you do so
sometimes<00:01:26.779> it's<00:01:27.139> three-point<00:01:27.529> shooting

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
sometimes it's three-point shooting

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.410 
sometimes it's three-point shooting
sometimes<00:01:28.189> it's<00:01:28.399> driving<00:01:28.850> sometimes<00:01:29.090> it's

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
sometimes it's driving sometimes it's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.940 
sometimes it's driving sometimes it's
rebounded<00:01:29.689> in<00:01:29.899> traffic<00:01:30.319> pushing<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.709> ball<00:01:30.829> on

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
rebounded in traffic pushing the ball on

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.429 
rebounded in traffic pushing the ball on
a<00:01:31.009> break<00:01:31.249> making<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.639> play<00:01:31.789> for<00:01:31.819> somebody<00:01:32.270> else

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
a break making a play for somebody else

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.190 
a break making a play for somebody else
sometimes<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:33.590> blocking<00:01:33.829> a<00:01:34.039> shot<00:01:34.840> he's<00:01:35.840> his

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
sometimes it blocking a shot he's his

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.529 
sometimes it blocking a shot he's his
length<00:01:36.499> helps<00:01:36.889> him<00:01:37.069> in<00:01:37.279> so<00:01:37.549> many<00:01:37.609> ways<00:01:37.939> I<00:01:38.389> mean

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
length helps him in so many ways I mean

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:39.910 
length helps him in so many ways I mean
the<00:01:38.719> dunk<00:01:38.959> obviously<00:01:39.409> but<00:01:39.560> typically

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
the dunk obviously but typically

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.239 
the dunk obviously but typically
defensively<00:01:40.490> even<00:01:40.880> more<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:41.740> but<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.920> think

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
defensively even more so but I think

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.379 
defensively even more so but I think
that<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.549> most<00:01:43.700> important<00:01:44.029> thing<00:01:44.060> about<00:01:44.209> him

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
that the most important thing about him
