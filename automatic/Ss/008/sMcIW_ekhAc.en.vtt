00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
of what exactly I am like what was I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.000 
of what exactly I am like what was I
looking<00:03:13.459> at<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.030> mean<00:03:14.359> it<00:03:14.780> was<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.500> was<00:03:15.680> yellow

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
looking at I mean it was it was yellow

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.280 
looking at I mean it was it was yellow
it<00:03:16.430> was<00:03:16.519> yellow<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.450> looks<00:03:17.750> like<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.959> bunny

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
it was yellow and it looks like a bunny

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.470 
it was yellow and it looks like a bunny
it<00:03:18.530> looks<00:03:18.739> like<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:18.920> bunny<00:03:19.310> alright<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.150> I'm

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
it looks like a bunny alright so I'm

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.800 
it looks like a bunny alright so I'm
guessing<00:03:20.989> it's<00:03:21.139> like<00:03:21.319> golden<00:03:22.250> Bonnie<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.660> now

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
guessing it's like golden Bonnie so now

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.379 
guessing it's like golden Bonnie so now
that<00:03:23.870> we<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.200> two<00:03:24.680> golden<00:03:25.250> versions<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
that we have two golden versions of the

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.870 
that we have two golden versions of the
animatronics<00:03:27.109> and<00:03:27.260> I'm<00:03:27.980> not<00:03:28.130> surprised<00:03:28.609> if

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
animatronics and I'm not surprised if

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.759 
animatronics and I'm not surprised if
Bonnie<00:03:29.209> would<00:03:29.450> get<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.690> golden<00:03:30.200> counterpart

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
Bonnie would get a golden counterpart

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.479 
Bonnie would get a golden counterpart
because<00:03:31.099> um<00:03:32.049> as<00:03:33.049> Ben<00:03:33.349> convert<00:03:33.620> or<00:03:33.859> well<00:03:34.190> not

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
because um as Ben convert or well not

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.430 
because um as Ben convert or well not
confirmed<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.269> Scott<00:03:35.510> Cawthon<00:03:35.720> himself<00:03:36.230> said

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
confirmed but Scott Cawthon himself said

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.770 
confirmed but Scott Cawthon himself said
that<00:03:36.470> Bonnie<00:03:36.859> is<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:37.340> scariest<00:03:37.849> animatronic

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
that Bonnie is the scariest animatronic

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.509 
that Bonnie is the scariest animatronic
so<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:38.930> wouldn't<00:03:39.530> be<00:03:39.680> surprised<00:03:40.099> if<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.340> was

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
so I wouldn't be surprised if this was

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.729 
so I wouldn't be surprised if this was
like<00:03:40.639> a<00:03:40.700> golden<00:03:41.389> version<00:03:41.870> or<00:03:41.989> something<00:03:42.019> or

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
like a golden version or something or

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.250 
like a golden version or something or
like<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:44.060> different<00:03:44.510> version<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:44.930> Bonnie

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
like a different version of Bonnie

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.830 
like a different version of Bonnie
because<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.340> know<00:03:46.459> Bonnie<00:03:46.790> needs<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.389> you

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
because you know Bonnie needs to you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.319 
because you know Bonnie needs to you
know<00:03:47.870> shed<00:03:48.620> some<00:03:48.859> light<00:03:48.889> on<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.489> scary<00:03:50.000> part

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
know shed some light on that scary part

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.860 
know shed some light on that scary part
and<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:51.380> know<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:52.060> find<00:03:53.060> Bonnie<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.510> be<00:03:53.630> also

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
and you know I find Bonnie to be also

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.679 
and you know I find Bonnie to be also
probably<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> scariest<00:03:55.209> animatronic<00:03:56.209> in<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
probably the scariest animatronic in the

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.740 
probably the scariest animatronic in the
game<00:03:57.159> in<00:03:58.159> my<00:03:58.430> opinion<00:03:58.819> I<00:03:58.909> kind<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.420> have<00:03:59.599> to
