 you will notice is my first gameplay 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.840

 I want to be a partner of machinima as a 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.150
 first step but 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.830
 for this I have to do this I have to 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.690
 upload gameplays and that's what I like 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 I want to dedicate that but I'm not going to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.740
 stop uploading tutorials of course 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.890
 that's not because that the tutorials are neither 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.600
 bases are basically what what I 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.220
 as I started the base of my 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.159
 subscribers of all of you so 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.380
 I thank you very much and good we are going to 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.070
 talk now yes a little bit of the gameplay in 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.070
 the rust 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.160
 this 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.160
 well you see that he killed him for the second time 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.710
 well , I get my radar 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.620
 it appears to me I do not know where I do not know by 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.620
 where do I go I turn around 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.760
 and disappears good 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.800
 now it's a bit boring and gameplay 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.800
 but it gets better more exciting 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.960
 now so I was but do not die 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.420
 and with the shotgun the truth I do not know what 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.300
 problem I have with this 47 but it is that 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.340
 I'm not going, I do not know if I have a lake 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.160
 but no 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.200
 I shoot him and I do not even want to 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.349
 the X comes out which means that I have 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.349
 dice 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 so well I see that you do not know that a 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.610
 no one 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.150
 I hope I leave I turn around and I get 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.150

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.650

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.440
 I turn around I see it from far away I pass by 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.360
 here so he does not see me I kill him 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:34.069

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.409
 hey, he took me out, I took out the harrier 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.409
 I put it more or less in the middle of the map 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.980

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.860
