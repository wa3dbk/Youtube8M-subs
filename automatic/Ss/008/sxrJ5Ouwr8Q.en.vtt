big bad boy maybe they were hurt maybe
they<00:01:57.630> were<00:01:57.869> dumbest<00:01:58.469> thing<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> NFL

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they were dumbest thing that the NFL

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.830 
they were dumbest thing that the NFL
could've<00:01:59.939> done<00:02:00.060> i<00:02:00.149> mean<00:02:00.240> i<00:02:00.360> would<00:02:00.509> say<00:02:00.659> i<00:02:00.689> would

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
could've done i mean i would say i would

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.190 
could've done i mean i would say i would
make<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> make<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.189> easy<00:02:02.390> if<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.899> if

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
make a make this really easy if you if

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.029 
make a make this really easy if you if
you<00:02:04.530> go<00:02:04.710> down<00:02:04.920> inter<00:02:05.840> you're<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
you go down inter you're out for the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.449 
you go down inter you're out for the
rest<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.819> other<00:02:09.000> teams<00:02:09.860> drive<00:02:10.860> series

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
rest of the other teams drive series

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.530 
rest of the other teams drive series
yeah<00:02:12.090> it'd<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.810> good<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.170> would

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
yeah it'd be good I would

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.089 
yeah it'd be good I would
I<00:02:13.569> would<00:02:13.810> support<00:02:14.079> that<00:02:14.140> he<00:02:14.349> wouldn't<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.950> of

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
I would support that he wouldn't that of

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.550 
I would support that he wouldn't that of
course<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:15.549> Paul<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.969> until<00:02:16.360> they<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
course but Paul it until they do the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.250 
course but Paul it until they do the
Giants<00:02:18.159> did<00:02:18.430> what<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.450> need<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.780> do<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.959> win

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
Giants did what you need to do to win

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.899 
Giants did what you need to do to win
and<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.769> they<00:02:20.950> exploited<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.519> system

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
and that is they exploited the system

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.750 
and that is they exploited the system
and<00:02:22.840> take<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.469> to<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.739> logic<00:02:24.189> of<00:02:24.310> collusion

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and take that to the logic of collusion

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.119 
and take that to the logic of collusion
where<00:02:25.239> do<00:02:25.359> you<00:02:25.450> stop<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.049> mean<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.379> they<00:02:26.560> fix<00:02:26.920> it

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
where do you stop I mean it they fix it

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.979 
where do you stop I mean it they fix it
you<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:27.549> what<00:02:27.700> Mason<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.299> said<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.599> put<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
you do what Mason just said you put in a

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.580 
you do what Mason just said you put in a
rule<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.590> makes<00:02:30.159> it<00:02:30.430> bad<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.540> do<00:02:31.689> it<00:02:31.870> there<00:02:32.290> is

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
rule that makes it bad to do it there is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.789 
rule that makes it bad to do it there is
no<00:02:32.890> mechanism<00:02:33.180> right<00:02:34.180> now<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:35.470> stop<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
no mechanism right now to stop the

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.710 
no mechanism right now to stop the
Giants<00:02:36.310> from<00:02:36.430> doing<00:02:36.670> what<00:02:36.819> they<00:02:36.939> did<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.299> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
Giants from doing what they did and the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.039 
Giants from doing what they did and the
NFL<00:02:38.099> who<00:02:39.099> is<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.639> over<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> last<00:02:40.329> two<00:02:40.540> days<00:02:40.689> 0

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
NFL who is just over the last two days 0

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.319 
NFL who is just over the last two days 0
for<00:02:41.319> 2<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.680> explaining<00:02:42.069> things<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:43.180> came

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
for 2 and explaining things just came

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.759 
for 2 and explaining things just came
out<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.599> said<00:02:43.780> not<00:02:44.049> only<00:02:44.079> is<00:02:44.439> there<00:02:44.590> not<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
out and said not only is there not a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.670 
out and said not only is there not a
mechanism<00:02:45.430> they<00:02:46.209> don't<00:02:46.420> foresee<00:02:47.049> getting<00:02:47.079> one

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
mechanism they don't foresee getting one

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.550 
mechanism they don't foresee getting one
so<00:02:48.340> what<00:02:48.609> if<00:02:48.879> I'm<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:49.569> I'm<00:02:49.689> a<00:02:49.750> defender<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.409> I'm

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
so what if I'm if I'm a defender and I'm

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.140 
so what if I'm if I'm a defender and I'm
going<00:02:50.829> up<00:02:50.920> against<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.370> no-huddle<00:02:51.730> Paula

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
going up against a no-huddle Paula

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.949 
going up against a no-huddle Paula
what's<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.409> stop<00:02:53.470> me<00:02:53.769> they're<00:02:54.159> chewing<00:02:54.519> me<00:02:54.819> up

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
what's to stop me they're chewing me up

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.440 
what's to stop me they're chewing me up
why<00:02:55.959> wouldn't<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.620> fake<00:02:56.950> an<00:02:57.129> injury<00:02:57.450> because

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
why wouldn't I fake an injury because

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.740 
why wouldn't I fake an injury because
you<00:02:58.930> need<00:02:59.139> to<00:02:59.169> win<00:02:59.530> legitimately<00:03:00.519> or<00:03:00.909> you<00:03:01.450> are

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
you need to win legitimately or you are

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.199 
you need to win legitimately or you are
not<00:03:01.780> good<00:03:02.139> enough<00:03:02.379> that's<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.889> Yeah<00:03:03.189> right<00:03:03.669> ok

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
not good enough that's it Yeah right ok

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.420 
not good enough that's it Yeah right ok
obviously<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> Giants<00:03:05.260> defense<00:03:05.650> isn't<00:03:05.919> good

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
obviously the Giants defense isn't good

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.460 
obviously the Giants defense isn't good
enough<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:07.060> deal<00:03:07.269> with<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.599> no-huddle<00:03:07.989> often

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
enough to deal with a no-huddle often

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.960 
enough to deal with a no-huddle often
well<00:03:08.620> they<00:03:08.709> want<00:03:08.829> but<00:03:09.370> there's<00:03:09.609> but<00:03:09.819> they're

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
well they want but there's but they're

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.509 
well they want but there's but they're
not<00:03:10.060> but<00:03:10.480> they<00:03:10.629> had<00:03:10.840> they<00:03:11.079> won<00:03:11.349> by<00:03:12.010> pretending

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
not but they had they won by pretending

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.419 
not but they had they won by pretending
they<00:03:12.849> were<00:03:12.879> injured
