okay that's going to talk about
regulated<00:00:03.449> systems<00:00:03.840> first<00:00:04.140> we're<00:00:04.319> gonna

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
regulated systems first we're gonna

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.230 
regulated systems first we're gonna
start<00:00:04.770> out<00:00:04.890> with<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.040> single<00:00:05.490> tank<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.089> then

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
start out with a single tank and then

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
able to put it on remember that when we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.260 
able to put it on remember that when we
say<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> covenants<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:38.940> mean<00:00:39.059> by<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
say the covenants what we mean by that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.080 
say the covenants what we mean by that
is<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.629> always<00:00:39.870> pass<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> regulator<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.850> our

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
is we always pass the regulator from our

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
is we always pass the regulator from our
mouth<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.770> important

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
mouth it so that's a really important

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.650 
mouth it so that's a really important
thing<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.090> working

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
thing because we know it's working

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
thing because we know it's working
we<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.410> breathable<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> gas

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
we know it's breathable we know the gas

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
we know it's breathable we know the gas
is<00:00:47.820> breathable<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.870> why

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
is breathable and that's and that's why

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.770 
is breathable and that's and that's why
we<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.280> regulator<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:50.789> one's<00:00:51.030> mouth<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
we use the regulator from one's mouth so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
we use the regulator from one's mouth so
the<00:00:51.899> gang<00:00:52.079> will<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.410> able<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> donate<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the gang will be able to donate it and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
the gang will be able to donate it and
we<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> long<00:00:54.149> hose<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> way

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
we put that on the long hose so that way

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 
we put that on the long hose so that way
we<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> exit<00:00:56.129> single-file<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.149> need<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.780> we

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
we can exit single-file if we need or we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.330 
we can exit single-file if we need or we
can<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.289> space<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
can have some space to get out of the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.729 
can have some space to get out of the
kelp<00:00:59.609> bed<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> open<00:01:00.270> water<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.469> work

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
kelp bed and open water or we can work

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.740 
kelp bed and open water or we can work
to<00:01:01.949> each<00:01:02.039> other<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> face<00:01:03.510> on

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to each other to do a you know a face on

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.590 
to each other to do a you know a face on
you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.470> face-to-face<00:01:05.060> direct<00:01:06.060> ascent<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you know a face-to-face direct ascent to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.190 
you know a face-to-face direct ascent to
the<00:01:06.659> surface<00:01:07.130> there's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> lot<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.549> reasons<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
the surface there's a lot of reasons and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.420 
the surface there's a lot of reasons and
flexibility<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.409> having<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> longer<00:01:11.159> hose

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
flexibility with having a longer hose

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
flexibility with having a longer hose
okay<00:01:12.210> let's<00:01:12.720> take<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> look<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
okay let's take a look at the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
okay let's take a look at the
configuration<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:14.729> thing<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> we

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
configuration first thing we see is we

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
configuration first thing we see is we
see<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.750> first<00:01:15.960> stage<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> cylinder

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
see the first stage up on the cylinder

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.620 
see the first stage up on the cylinder
that<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.729> stage<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.210> there

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that first stage right there

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.730 
that first stage right there
as<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.500> has<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:21.740> high-pressure

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
as you see it has got the high-pressure

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
as you see it has got the high-pressure
hose<00:01:23.100> coming<00:01:23.490> off<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> left<00:01:24.030> side<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
hose coming off the left side that

hose coming off the left side that
high-pressure<00:01:24.930> hose<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.500> generally<00:01:25.950> right

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
high-pressure hose is generally right

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.270 
high-pressure hose is generally right
around<00:01:26.369> 24<00:01:27.030> inches<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.290> sixty<00:01:29.070> five

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
around 24 inches or so sixty five

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.609 
around 24 inches or so sixty five
centimeters<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> gauge<00:01:31.320> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
centimeters and and it's on a gauge on

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950

use the hose just like you're seeing in
the<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:50.970> I'm<00:01:51.090> using<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> be

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the way I'm using it now you want to be

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830 
the way I'm using it now you want to be
able<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> read<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.979> gauge<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.210> use

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
able to read this gauge like this use

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.870

the<00:01:55.049> hose<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> t-handle<00:01:55.920> come<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
the hose like a t-handle come back and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
the hose like a t-handle come back and
clip<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> d-rings<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.469> it

clip it to the d-rings just like that it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
clip it to the d-rings just like that it
actually<00:01:59.159> becomes<00:01:59.430> really<00:02:00.030> easy<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.630> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
actually becomes really easy and just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.240 
actually becomes really easy and just
takes<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.049> bit<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> practice<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.860> muscle

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
takes a bit of practice for muscle

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.209 
takes a bit of practice for muscle
memory<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:03.060> there<00:02:03.829> they're<00:02:04.829> not<00:02:04.860> coming

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
memory right there they're not coming

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.880 
memory right there they're not coming
off<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.270> ELSA<00:02:06.719> first<00:02:07.170> stage<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.439> want<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
off if the ELSA first stage you want to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.130 
off if the ELSA first stage you want to
send<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.369> your<00:02:08.550> low<00:02:08.789> pressure<00:02:09.030> hose<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.110> your

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
send out your low pressure hose to your

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.500 
send out your low pressure hose to your
your<00:02:10.649> buoyancy<00:02:11.370> compensating<00:02:11.940> devices<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
your buoyancy compensating devices you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.699 
your buoyancy compensating devices you
can<00:02:12.660> power<00:02:12.930> inflate

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
can power inflate

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.619 
can power inflate
and<00:02:13.980> generally<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.700> don't<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.599> that

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
and generally I don't like it in that

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.270 
and generally I don't like it in that
position<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.500> actually<00:02:16.920> will

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
position because that actually will

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190 
position because that actually will
disconnect<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.689> go<00:02:18.840> through

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
disconnect it I like that to go through

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.199 
disconnect it I like that to go through
there<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:19.709> then<00:02:20.159> you<00:02:20.280> simply<00:02:20.700> connect<00:02:21.030> that

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
there and then you simply connect that

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.420 
there and then you simply connect that
there<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:21.719> that<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.319> way<00:02:22.500> when<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.310> go

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
there like that so that way when you go

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.949 
there like that so that way when you go
to<00:02:23.489> lift<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.939> and<00:02:24.000> use<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.750> doesn't

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
to lift this and use it it doesn't

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.539 
to lift this and use it it doesn't
disconnect<00:02:25.680> your<00:02:25.799> low<00:02:25.920> pressure<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.340> flatter

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
disconnect your low pressure and flatter

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.399 
disconnect your low pressure and flatter
you<00:02:26.969> still<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.359> your<00:02:27.510> power<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.959> still<00:02:28.230> have

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
you still have your power you still have

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.750 
you still have your power you still have
your<00:02:28.530> dump<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.310> kind<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.549> stuff<00:02:29.640> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
your dump and all that kind of stuff so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.610 
your dump and all that kind of stuff so
generally<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.299> comes<00:02:30.659> off<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> left<00:02:31.230> side<00:02:31.409> I

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
generally that comes off the left side I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 
generally that comes off the left side I
like<00:02:32.189> to<00:02:32.370> make<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> consistent<00:02:33.150> length

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
like to make that a consistent length

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.839 
like to make that a consistent length
again<00:02:33.900> 24<00:02:34.439> inches<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.829> that<00:02:34.859> you<00:02:35.099> notice<00:02:35.459> that

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
again 24 inches so that you notice that

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.280 
again 24 inches so that you notice that
this<00:02:36.090> thing<00:02:36.299> is<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.569> super<00:02:36.959> long<00:02:37.079> not

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
this thing is not super long not

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.199 
this thing is not super long not
dangling<00:02:37.650> down<00:02:37.889> here<00:02:38.159> there's<00:02:38.400> no<00:02:38.549> extra<00:02:39.000> hose

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
dangling down here there's no extra hose

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.209 
dangling down here there's no extra hose
you<00:02:39.780> know<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.560> right<00:02:40.739> length<00:02:40.769> then

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
you know it's the right length then

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.220 
you know it's the right length then
later<00:02:41.459> when<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> put<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.329> you<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:43.079> get

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
later when I put this on you really get

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.490 
later when I put this on you really get
a<00:02:43.260> good<00:02:43.530> overview<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.219> how<00:02:44.639> clean<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:46.079> system

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
a good overview of how clean this system

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.970 
a good overview of how clean this system
is<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.980> single<00:02:47.189> tank<00:02:47.549> system<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:49.709> coming

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
is for a single tank system so coming

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.140 
is for a single tank system so coming
off<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.220> right-hand<00:02:50.430> side<00:02:50.849> you're<00:02:51.030> gonna

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
off the right-hand side you're gonna

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.729 
off the right-hand side you're gonna
have<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.629> necklace<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.139> necklace<00:02:52.169> is<00:02:52.620> really
