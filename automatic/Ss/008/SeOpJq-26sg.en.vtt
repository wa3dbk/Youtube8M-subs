00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
really well no plums though because the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.960 
really well no plums though because the
center<00:02:07.170> tree<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.899> cross<00:02:09.899> breeder<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
center tree is the cross breeder one and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.780 
so we're hoping we get a false spring
and<00:02:17.750> they<00:02:18.750> bloom<00:02:18.990> again<00:02:19.280> since<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.430> got<00:02:20.550> so

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
whole interior is surrounded by sand and

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920 
whole interior is surrounded by sand and
there's<00:06:53.070> about<00:06:53.220> 46<00:06:53.910> inches<00:06:54.240> of<00:06:54.420> sand<00:06:54.600> on<00:06:54.810> the

there's about 46 inches of sand on the
bottom<00:06:55.080> and<00:06:56.180> then<00:06:57.180> we<00:06:57.330> line<00:06:57.540> rocks<00:06:57.810> around<00:06:58.080> the

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
bottom and then we line rocks around the

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.100 
bottom and then we line rocks around the
edge<00:06:58.910> just<00:06:59.910> to<00:07:00.030> kind<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.300> give<00:07:00.390> it<00:07:00.510> a<00:07:00.630> base<00:07:00.840> so

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
edge just to kind of give it a base so

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.610 
edge just to kind of give it a base so
we<00:07:01.140> can<00:07:01.230> bring<00:07:01.470> the<00:07:01.590> sand<00:07:01.860> level<00:07:02.160> up<00:07:02.370> and<00:07:03.620> then

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
we can bring the sand level up and then

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.990 
we can bring the sand level up and then
you<00:07:04.800> want<00:07:04.950> to<00:07:05.010> keep<00:07:05.160> this<00:07:05.310> covered<00:07:05.730> you<00:07:05.850> can

sand really well we will have a
frigerator<00:07:19.730> and<00:07:20.730> we're<00:07:20.850> just<00:07:20.970> using<00:07:21.180> that<00:07:21.300> to

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.480 
frigerator and we're just using that to

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.870 
frigerator and we're just using that to
cover<00:07:21.720> it<00:07:21.930> just<00:07:22.260> to<00:07:22.350> keep<00:07:22.500> the<00:07:22.740> dirt<00:07:23.490> out<00:07:23.640> and<00:07:23.790> I

cover it just to keep the dirt out and I

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.770 
cover it just to keep the dirt out and I
get<00:07:24.060> more<00:07:24.210> sand<00:07:25.550> so<00:07:26.550> there<00:07:26.700> you<00:07:26.820> go<00:07:26.850> folks<00:07:27.180> make

an off-grid fridge i'll do a temperature

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.930 
an off-grid fridge i'll do a temperature
next<00:07:30.840> time<00:07:30.960> i<00:07:31.050> come<00:07:31.080> out<00:07:31.440> and<00:07:31.710> see<00:07:32.640> what<00:07:32.790> kind
