00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.600
 hello so my name is in time 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.639
 it's today I'm going to show you 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.050
 how do we make the shadows on a long 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.240
 front portrait so with the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.550
 technique paper notch apple and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.300
 of brass by oklahoma a pencil to 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.810
 paper 2b so it's fatter than the hb 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:37.630
 basic one so we have a graphical mine 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.030
 so that's really where we have 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.020
 a green jacket is actually like 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.800
 blotting paper but video is there we 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.690
 has an eraser that serve them but this pan 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.850
 so who like without making any traces 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.110
 it is very practical uncommon draws 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.800
 in pencil paper so I'm going to make a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.530
 Justin a head base surfaces will 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 to say that just mona 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.540
 so that's not necessarily the interest 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:30.970
 but here are some of them you want them to 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:39.310
 participate started sun so a head 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 basic so we have here so we will have that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.180
 eyebrows 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.609
 not very far eyebrows 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.259
 So here are the eyes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 or 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.880
 we put that there is really a shadow 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.060
 on the face the beginning 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.060
 and in truth without expression at the beginning 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.820
 so here we have a basic head without 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:43.560
 expression still make the eyes 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.560
 but here I am disappointed 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.520
 then we will start to note the points 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.490
 the areas of which but as long as the light 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.590
 the more we come from there and that the shadow is 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.690
 here so it will be on half of the face 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.040
 but it must be noted that so the face to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.860
 to more bumpy places than 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.550
 others so for example under the root 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.620
 hair will be an area whose jda 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.490
 been rough and then we can 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.490
 the increase then we will here 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.170
 still a fault so by the hair 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.670
 here below the eyebrow so left 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.960
 here so you really have to mark the ridge 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.550
 of the nose because it's a peak so 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.560
 here under the eye also have 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.030
 marked the cheekbone for a face of 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.390
 female base so there we have below in 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.620
 under the moon and we also have a water 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:55.590
 which here and here also below so 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.690
 then we're going to fade a 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.890
 little bit so men number with one 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.890
 pen here 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:17.739
 and she and pressure could natural 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:19.260
 possible note that there will also be 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.890
 lens falls on the lips 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:30.490
 we need a lot of police and 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:36.490
 20 hours here like this is it 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:40.720
 who then a little more marked 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:44.800
 the essential is then the soft eyes to 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:50.760
 over the world whose disks have almost 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.760
 moire is below 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.230
 closing to another it will be my style 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:08.090
 notice beyond we can squarely 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:09.770
 matthew hitherto really marked and 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.830
 to avoid that they remained very much in 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.830
 can do it by hand like this 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:27.590
 1 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:29.449
 things are here and so on that side 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.789
 there will also be a lot more money 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:36.789
 Light to remind that there are also 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:45.229
 there are also reliefs but 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.370
 a lot in my daughter so under 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.710
 hair the ears but otherwise with and 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.979
 all around the face and especially to 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.700
 neck level it's really a lot 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:05.090
 more concert 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:05.090
 do not like it and here 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.810
 so for a more refined rendering we will 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.780
 do with your finger and pay attention to 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.930
 what they remain more brands 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:26.880
 brands that had basically to show 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.880
 the points he needs more to his father 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.970
 here 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:56.680
 so now we can take the wheel 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.110
 for a final touch what I do 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.420
 me but who is not obligatory me I 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.690
 ends when you have really good at the 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.690
 stop 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:15.490
 i will usually take lala com for 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:18.700
 to give finally to give back a 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:22.330
 clearer place for example can 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:30.420
 have one side of the rings at the level of 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:30.420
 nose like that was born mouth 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.020
 there is above the eyebrow so here 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.040
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.900
 video is redone several times 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.960
 to remember you especially 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:51.350
 you can watch someone in the sun 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.330
 with a light on this side for you 

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.870
 take some shadows and then be able to 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:59.050
 memory business here 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.050
 good luck
