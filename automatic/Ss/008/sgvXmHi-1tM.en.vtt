00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.899
 to show where the four pieces are 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.370
 of the thunder and good we go for the 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.790

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.000
 where the m16 ride here we have it 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.260
 the andren catch that can be put here 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.140
 just in these cars we have 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.359
 hidden is on the wall where the m16 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.939
 in front of the wall was 16 m here 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.010
 we come to the second piece of the thunder 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.869
 which is where the knife house 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.980
 bowie and second you do not know the way to 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.990
 Bowie can find the video in 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.670
 my channel and you can put the mattress is 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.469
 the one you are seeing on the little table or 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.940
 just behind me behind that there is a 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.380
 chimney is worth it then you can put it in 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.240
 Fireplace 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.890
 and well, I say the one that does not pay 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.440
 get to this house or this cabin 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.350
 has the path in my channel to one by the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.840
 another piece that is where it is born from 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.490
 a totem and you can also put in 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.830
 three different sites here within the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.600
 nats map of a totem that also the 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.130
 that the road is not going to get here 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.680
 way here is on my channel 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.840
 and well, you can see it 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.750
 can put here right where I was in 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.730
 above the filing cabinet is the white 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.500
 can put on the stairs where is 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.450
 that stops as if it were going to leave the door 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.330
 can be put there or on the shelf 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.980
 that can be put also worth seeing 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.340
 now let's go for the fourth piece that 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.750
 is where electricity here you can 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.150
 put the turbine and over the door without 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.440
 put country electricity faster and 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.260
 here you can also put in three 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.560
 different sites to see a little bit the 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.330
 zombie we come here and the first 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 site that can be put is right here 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.170
 from here below where we throw ourselves there 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.810
 treat them as if they were thrown then here to the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.490
 right going up in the barrels or here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.770
 to the left where the piece is now 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.410
 same value here you have seen the lame 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.820
 AndrÃ© now here is like a nest worth 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.680
 well that's also that's the fourth 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.840
 piece of the thunder or they are not 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.790
 ordered according to the second one to take the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.650
 we try you have the roads to all 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.180
 and well then nothing because then you mount the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.820
 thunder that is mounted in the titan zone 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.330
 where is the resistance and then it 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.500
 it stays like this turning on and on you can only 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.090
 carry one there was a trick so that what 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 will be inside at the moment I think it's 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.130
 patched so if it's something else we would 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.200
 I will say 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.610
 nothing since being can be used to take out 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.350
 bonuses and you do not have to spend it 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.600
 a lot because if you do not dismantle in a thousand 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.890
 pieces and it breaks and well then here you 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.740
 I will show where is the fist 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.510
 American traffic we climb here to the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.760
 roof that will boast roof you have to 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.830
 put you have to put the trap door 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 bus we went up to the roof and we 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.790
 we buy the american fist that is there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.470
 that kills more than one touch until the round 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.690
 14 and the monkeys kill them too 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.400
 pretty good so nothing this has been 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.960
 everything where they are fond of editing 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.620
 I hope you liked it and served you a 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.620
 greeting and until the next
