fans<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.690> getting<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> little<00:00:46.020> restless

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
fans are getting a little restless

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.750 
fans are getting a little restless
because<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.040> see<00:00:47.220> some<00:00:47.460> scores

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
because they want to see some scores

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.890 
because they want to see some scores
some<00:00:47.970> more<00:00:48.090> scores<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.560> far<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.370> been<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
some more scores but so far it's been a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.420 
some more scores but so far it's been a
defensive<00:00:51.900> game<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.130> second

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
defensive game so I think the second

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.110 
defensive game so I think the second
half<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.850> probably<00:00:53.970> opened<00:00:54.330> up<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.450> little<00:00:54.570> more

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
half it probably opened up a little more

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
half it probably opened up a little more
I<00:00:58.370> mean<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> know<00:00:59.550> enough<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.450> Rugby<00:01:01.230> League

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I mean I know enough about Rugby League

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.010 
I mean I know enough about Rugby League
to<00:01:01.650> know<00:01:01.830> how<00:01:02.340> physical<00:01:02.880> it<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.900> I'm<00:01:03.989> not

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
to know how physical it is so I'm not

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.710

you<00:02:04.080> do<00:02:04.229> maybe<00:02:14.030> he's<00:02:15.030> been<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:15.360> quiet<00:02:15.600> so

you do maybe he's been a little quiet so
far<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.470> think<00:02:16.709> it's<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> try<00:02:17.520> to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
far I think it's like I have to try to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.740 
far I think it's like I have to try to
give<00:02:17.730> him<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.849> ball<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> little<00:02:18.150> bit<00:02:18.330> more<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
give him a ball a little bit more and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.800 
give him a ball a little bit more and
hopefully<00:02:19.410> he'll<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.860> able<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.130> use<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.520> speed

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
hopefully he'll be able to use to speed

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.420 
hopefully he'll be able to use to speed
the<00:02:21.810> crowd<00:02:22.050> what<00:02:22.290> do<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.440> think<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
the crowd what do you think all the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.830 
the crowd what do you think all the
crowds<00:02:23.640> been<00:02:23.819> amazing<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.330> crowds<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
crowds been amazing the crowds it you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.790 
crowds been amazing the crowds it you
can<00:02:24.959> tell<00:02:25.080> they're<00:02:25.230> definitely<00:02:25.410> into<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
can tell they're definitely into the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.680 
can tell they're definitely into the
game<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.270> said<00:02:27.330> they're<00:02:27.660> a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
game and but like I said they're a

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.570 
game and but like I said they're a
little<00:02:27.840> restless<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.099> want<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> see

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
little restless because they want to see

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.510 
little restless because they want to see
some<00:02:29.790> more<00:02:29.940> scores<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> second

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
some more scores so I think the second

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.610 
some more scores so I think the second
half<00:02:32.700> will<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.209> better<00:02:33.420> game

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.110 

it<00:02:38.769> definitely<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.340> yeah<00:02:39.519> definitely<00:02:39.940> worth

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
it definitely is yeah definitely worth

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.920 
it definitely is yeah definitely worth
to<00:02:40.299> come<00:02:40.480> watch<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.560> exciting<00:02:42.010> sport

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
to come watch and it's exciting sport

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.259 
to come watch and it's exciting sport
but<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:45.099> doesn't<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.549> justice<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.940> watch<00:02:46.120> on

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
but it doesn't do it justice to watch on

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.759 
but it doesn't do it justice to watch on
TV<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.659> had<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.870> come<00:02:47.019> see<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.290> person<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:49.769> want
