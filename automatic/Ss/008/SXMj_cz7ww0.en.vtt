00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 good 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.270
 because we are here in the circuit of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.670
 montmeló for the presentation of strength 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.550
 4 where we were able to try the game 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.050
 with kinect with steering wheel and 3 screens and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.579
 The truth is that we bring you some 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 Pretty pleasant impressions of a game 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.630
 that looks really good now so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.399
 soon we will catch a ferrari of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 truth and we're going to take a little spin 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.899
 for the circuit of cataluña 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.670
 I hope that good is still alive after 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.750
 this experience to be able to tell you 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.750
 more about force 4 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.060
 the creator of the game and well we wanted 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.280
 ask him some questions if he does not get it wrong 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.910
 about forza motorsport 4 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.560
 first of all is to ask but it is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.450
 basic ask what differences there are 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.450
 between force 3 and force 4 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.519
 well you know forza motorsport 4 is 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.500
 we have things better in all areas 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.720
 new in the multiplayer integration 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.730
 with kinect an amazing graphic improvement 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.740
 and also thanks to pirelli new 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.560
 physical forms 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.620
 is fantastic that's great indeed 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.660
 we've been testing kinect and it's 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.700
 fantastic the experience the only thing that 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.720
 tires a bit to men there are 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.010
 do some kind of exercise 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.010
 preparatory to it 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 I think and if what you want to do are the 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.709
 24 hours of le mans is better than 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.300
 do with while you have is more for 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.670
 have fun with the kids enjoy 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.530
 colliding with cars I would not recommend 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.450
 play it over an hour will continue to not 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.020
 be that you have the habit of doing 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.450
 perfect weights ok we'll keep it in mind 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.100
 and we will notice later we also wanted 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.260
 know cars that you can tell us about 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.140
 new cars is a new brand that 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.610
 make it good that it is totally new and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.410
 that you say this was what I wanted to put 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.190
 in force 3 we could not and now in force 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.190
 4 we have achieved it 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.390
 why 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.660
 in force 4 important is the diversity 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.060
 we have many cars of 80 brands 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.610
 different and about 500 in total and also 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.709
 let's see signs visually by 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.430
 what month to month will have new cars to 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.709
 your disposal 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.840
 we can add cars while 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.130
 they go out to the market they do 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.229
 celebrates the sweat tome bile of 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.669
 Frankfurt and there cars have been announced 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.840
 new ones that we can introduce in the 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.080
 game 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.760
 and one more thing is that there are many 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.530
 cars but each car can be a 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.750
 world because you can customize it from 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.340
 a thousand ways that new ways of 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.660
 customize the tournament car we have 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.660
 here in the forza motorsport 4 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.509
 Water 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.669
 Forza Motorsport 4 focuses on the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.680
 passion for cars but people live 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.240
 this passion in different ways some 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.460
 other drivers are painted in 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.810
 other bodies are dedicated to touring and 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.400
 others are photographer mind 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.190
 we did not want to do six versions of the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.260
 same car so for example we have 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.810
 normal classic cars to which they 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.400
 you can add retro kits to make them 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.860
 look like classic car cars 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.780
 we also have more current cars to 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.240
 which you can put original kits 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.280
 from the manufacturer to make them look like 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.680
 other tuned vehicles of the world and 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.690
 then the paint editor that's where 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.250
 is the real potential people 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.289
 can do amazing jobs 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.830
 design and then sell them at homes 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.830
 wear 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.150
 thank you very much 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.340
 good
