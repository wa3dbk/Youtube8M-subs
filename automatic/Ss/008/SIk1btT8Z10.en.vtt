 president of marvel studios but with 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.850
 this agreement would not only see

 speedy in marvel movies like the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
 to characters like the avengers' in 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.570
 spiderman movies what will

 Tuesday will give you a continuity 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.009
 creative and authenticity to the character 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.750
 while sony pictures will follow 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.729
 charge of financing the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.800
 distribution of rights over the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.170
 character and the final creative control 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.740
 of this on the other hand to accommodate the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.840
 stress 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.549
 of this new spider-man movie more 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.619
 the studios changed the dates of 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.890
 premiere of four of his films the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.200
 phase 3 including author ragnarok which 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.450
 it was going to be released on July 28, 2017 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.789
 but now it will be released on 3 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.229
 November 2017 that the film 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.179
 marvel will appear for the first time 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.640
 spider-man according to the wall street journal 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.100
 a source close to margo studios 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.170
 says it will be in captcha in america 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 civil war which would be the most logical 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.479
 due to the important role it has 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.819
 spider-man in that comic although there's 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.580
 some rumors that we might see a 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.649
 scene post credits in avengers made 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.869
 function in which we would have a 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.549
 small cameo of spider-man we will see the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.440
 get high on interpreting this again 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.120
 character was not said anything in the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.549
 statement per second wall street 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.350
 journal and the wrap andrew garfield is 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.990
 history 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.540
 and it will be this other reboot of the character 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.670
 according to what we saw in the negotiations 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.430
 that leaked from the baton cane and makes 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.140
 a few months what they want is to present 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.970
 a new spa mana included in the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.160
 story but without the need to go back 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.330
 to tell again its origins what 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.800
 with a radioactive spider wants 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.640
 superpowers dies the uncle see in a 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.330
 great power entails a great 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.030
 responsibility we already know all that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.670
 the interesting thing would be to burn two studies 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.430
 and they are and choose more morals as their 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.920
 new spider-man and twitter confirms it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.110
 because since Monday over moral 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.330
 It has been trending topic not only 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.130
 both studies would be reinforcing their 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.230
 discourse of inclusion of minorities 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.300
 thanks to the Hispanic and afro roots 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.490
 Americans of moral means but that 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.440
 they could also tell the origins of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.510
 morals without having to go back to 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.920
 mention the origins of Peter Parker and 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.750
 they do not even have to get rid of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.700
 Peter Parker can only return to 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.860
 appear in the future what it would give us 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.930
 a robot without being a reboot there we have 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.550
 the ultimate version of nick fury in the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.410
 marvel's movie universe 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.720
 so maybe it 's time to have a 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.240
 ultimate version spider-man you what 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.130

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.780
