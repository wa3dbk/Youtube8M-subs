I kept forgetting that I had the
piercing<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.850> kept<00:03:27.130> hitting<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
piercing and it kept hitting the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.510 
piercing and it kept hitting the
piercing<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.270> really<00:03:29.990> hurt<00:03:30.170> before<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.890> got

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
piercing it really hurt before you got

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.550 
piercing it really hurt before you got
bad<00:03:31.790> it's<00:03:32.360> easier<00:03:32.990> to<00:03:33.500> then<00:03:34.120> put<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:37.150> plaster<00:03:38.150> on

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
bad it's easier to then put a plaster on

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.840 
bad it's easier to then put a plaster on
like<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:40.220> Cooper's<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:44.560> piercing<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
like that Cooper's the piercing so you

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.210 
like that Cooper's the piercing so you
know<00:03:47.030> like<00:03:47.330> Matt's<00:03:47.959> about<00:03:48.319> with<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.620> cause<00:03:49.100> it

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
know like Matt's about with it cause it

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.610 
know like Matt's about with it cause it
can<00:03:49.430> cause<00:03:49.640> saw<00:03:50.200> soreness<00:03:51.200> around<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:54.410> you

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
can cause saw soreness around and if you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.620 
can cause saw soreness around and if you
sleep<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.670> don't<00:03:55.790> want<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.090> knock<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
sleep in you don't want to knock the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.250 
sleep in you don't want to knock the
piercing<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:57.950> should<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.209> put<00:03:59.230> like<00:04:00.230> a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
piercing so you should just put like a

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.630 
piercing so you should just put like a
big<00:04:00.560> square<00:04:01.750> plaster<00:04:02.750> over<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.560> stop<00:04:03.830> it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
big square plaster over it to stop it

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.270 
big square plaster over it to stop it
nothing<00:04:04.850> really<00:04:05.150> cool<00:04:05.660> more<00:04:06.260> comfortable<00:04:06.830> to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
nothing really cool more comfortable to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.420 
nothing really cool more comfortable to
sleep<00:04:07.519> as<00:04:07.819> well<00:04:08.440> first<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.650> all<00:04:09.769> for<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.130> salt

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
sleep as well first of all for the salt

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.270 
sleep as well first of all for the salt
water<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.850> should<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:12.670> fill<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.880> cattle<00:04:14.660> up

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
water you should and fill the cattle up

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.140 
water you should and fill the cattle up
and<00:04:16.280> then<00:04:16.489> Turner<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.769> then<00:04:19.430> wait<00:04:19.820> for<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.000> to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
and then Turner and then wait for it to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.060 
and then Turner and then wait for it to
boil<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:20.870> whilst<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.859> should

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
boil but whilst you do that you should

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.570 
boil but whilst you do that you should
get<00:04:22.370> ready

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.700 

when<00:04:31.580> laps<00:04:31.789> finished<00:04:32.300> boiling<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:35.300> should

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
when laps finished boiling you should

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.219 
when laps finished boiling you should
that<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.889> salt<00:04:38.530> I've<00:04:39.530> think<00:04:40.810> rock<00:04:41.810> salts

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
that is salt I've think rock salts

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.640 
that is salt I've think rock salts
better<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:43.099> it<00:04:43.310> but<00:04:43.870> whichever<00:04:44.870> salt<00:04:45.229> you<00:04:45.409> can

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
better for it but whichever salt you can

00:04:45.650 --> 00:05:00.429 
better for it but whichever salt you can
and<00:04:47.110> get<00:04:48.110> hold<00:04:48.319> off<00:04:48.469> but<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.250> should<00:04:59.439> maybe

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
and get hold off but you should maybe

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:22.629 
and get hold off but you should maybe
part<00:05:01.069> of<00:05:01.129> it<00:05:07.629> let<00:05:08.629> that<00:05:16.509> smooth<00:05:17.509> off<00:05:21.639> it's

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
part of it let that smooth off it's

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.189 
part of it let that smooth off it's
probably<00:05:23.150> with<00:05:23.330> too<00:05:23.599> much<00:05:25.419> weight<00:05:26.419> fit<00:05:27.050> up<00:05:27.169> to

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
probably with too much weight fit up to

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.730 
probably with too much weight fit up to
dissolve<00:05:28.129> about<00:05:28.729> wait<00:05:29.719> a<00:05:29.779> few<00:05:29.930> minutes<00:05:30.110> for<00:05:30.590> it

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
dissolve about wait a few minutes for it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.159 
dissolve about wait a few minutes for it
to<00:05:30.800> cool<00:05:31.039> down<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:31.550> dissolve<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:34.190> then<00:05:35.169> yeah

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
to cool down and dissolve and then yeah

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.640 
to cool down and dissolve and then yeah
that's<00:05:36.409> it

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
that's it

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.730 
that's it
you<00:05:39.650> should<00:05:39.830> hold<00:05:40.129> this<00:05:40.490> um<00:05:43.779> that<00:05:44.779> make<00:05:45.440> so

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
you should hold this um that make so

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:59.460 
you should hold this um that make so
that<00:05:47.229> it<00:05:48.229> doesn't<00:05:48.589> leap<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:50.150> then<00:05:50.979> hold<00:05:51.979> it

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:06.180 

I'll<00:06:01.080> be<00:06:02.080> asleep<00:06:04.260> just<00:06:05.260> practice<00:06:05.770> out<00:06:05.950> a<00:06:05.980> few

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
I'll be asleep just practice out a few

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.580 
I'll be asleep just practice out a few
times<00:06:07.620> which<00:06:08.620> will<00:06:08.980> help<00:06:09.310> as<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:10.000> like<00:06:10.660> cleaning

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
times which will help as I like cleaning

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.750 
times which will help as I like cleaning
and<00:06:11.740> stop<00:06:12.280> it<00:06:12.430> impaction<00:06:13.000> and<00:06:13.240> it<00:06:13.990> can<00:06:14.760> and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
and stop it impaction and it can and

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.830 
and stop it impaction and it can and
stop<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:16.810> being<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.410> as<00:06:17.650> well
