can<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> regular<00:02:02.009> application<00:02:02.130> running

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
can have a regular application running

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.309 
can have a regular application running
in<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> background<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.170> done

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
in the background so this can be done

them also if I swipe it to the side here

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.860 
them also if I swipe it to the side here
it's<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> come<00:02:14.970> store<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.450> as<00:02:15.569> little

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
it's going to come store it as little

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.449 
it's going to come store it as little
icons<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> kind<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.739> move<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.980> away<00:02:17.069> and

then open it back up if I need to and to
close<00:02:19.590> them<00:02:19.799> out<00:02:19.860> you're<00:02:20.040> simply<00:02:20.340> going<00:02:20.489> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
close them out you're simply going to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
close them out you're simply going to
just<00:02:20.730> click<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.090> X<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:21.450> each<00:02:21.599> application<00:02:22.019> we

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
just click the X on each application we

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.740 
just click the X on each application we
also<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.400> new<00:02:23.670> feature<00:02:23.940> called<00:02:24.239> slide

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
also have a new feature called slide

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.660 
also have a new feature called slide
aside<00:02:25.080> which<00:02:25.410> allows<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.950> multitasking<00:02:26.160> as

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
aside which allows for multitasking as

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.240 
aside which allows for multitasking as
well<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.720> slide<00:02:28.079> aside<00:02:28.410> if<00:02:28.739> i<00:02:28.890> open<00:02:29.069> my

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
well so with slide aside if i open my

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
well so with slide aside if i open my
gallery<00:02:29.849> if<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> make<00:02:30.989> three<00:02:31.170> points<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
gallery if I to make three points of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.059 
gallery if I to make three points of
contact<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.130> slide<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.610> left<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.860> going

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
contact and slide to the left it's going

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.589 
contact and slide to the left it's going
to<00:02:35.099> store<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.430> application<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.299> for<00:02:36.510> me

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
to store that application there for me

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.750 
to store that application there for me
so<00:02:37.079> say<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.260> was<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.530> my<00:02:37.620> gallery<00:02:37.829> now<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> need<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so say I was in my gallery now I need to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.150 
so say I was in my gallery now I need to
go<00:02:38.849> send<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.150> text<00:02:39.450> message<00:02:39.769> sign<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.099> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
go send a text message sign up to the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
go send a text message sign up to the
left<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.700> again<00:02:42.209> I'll<00:02:42.329> use<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.660> browser<00:02:42.900> as

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
left and again I'll use the browser as

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.740 
left and again I'll use the browser as
an<00:02:43.290> example<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.790> these<00:02:45.060> applications<00:02:45.690> are

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
an example now these applications are

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.270 
an example now these applications are
all<00:02:45.870> stored<00:02:46.110> inside<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.799> order<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> access

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
all stored inside so in order to access

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.589 
all stored inside so in order to access
them<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:47.819> going<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.090> make<00:02:48.180> three<00:02:48.360> points

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
them you just going to make three points

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.180 
them you just going to make three points
of<00:02:48.750> contact<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.349> slide<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:49.920> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of contact and slide to the right and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.550 
of contact and slide to the right and
now<00:02:50.640> i'm<00:02:50.730> easily<00:02:50.970> able<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.569> access<00:02:52.049> these<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
now i'm easily able to access these and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.259 
now i'm easily able to access these and
jump<00:02:52.769> between<00:02:52.889> them<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.910> great<00:02:54.120> way

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
jump between them so it's a great way

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.000 
jump between them so it's a great way
for<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.690> set<00:02:55.019> aside<00:02:55.139> the<00:02:55.319> applications

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
for you to set aside the applications

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.680 
for you to set aside the applications
you<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> have<00:02:56.609> that<00:02:56.790> quick<00:02:57.060> access<00:02:57.239> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
you want to have that quick access to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.539 
you want to have that quick access to
and<00:02:57.900> again<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:58.590> simply<00:02:58.889> brief<00:02:59.160> points<00:02:59.340> of

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
and again it's simply brief points of

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.430 
and again it's simply brief points of
contacts<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.209> left<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.600> Gordon<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.170> to

that as well and then the other ones
really<00:03:39.269> cool<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.659> what's<00:03:39.840> called<00:03:40.019> track<00:03:40.349> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
really cool is what's called track and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.349 
really cool is what's called track and
zoom<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.669> going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.849> allow<00:03:41.969> you<00:03:42.090> to

zoom so this is going to allow you to

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.869 
zoom so this is going to allow you to
focus<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.620> portion<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.370> frame<00:03:44.669> and

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
focus in on a portion of the frame and

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.059 
focus in on a portion of the frame and
even<00:03:45.599> if<00:03:45.719> you<00:03:45.810> move<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.109> camera<00:03:46.349> it's<00:03:46.919> going

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
even if you move the camera it's going

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.420 
even if you move the camera it's going
to<00:03:47.099> keep<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.549> in<00:03:48.469> in<00:03:49.469> the<00:03:49.709> frame<00:03:49.889> as<00:03:50.129> long<00:03:50.280> as

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
to keep this in in the frame as long as

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.770 
to keep this in in the frame as long as
it's<00:03:50.609> within<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.969> range<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.299> what<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.540> camera

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
it's within the range of what the camera

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.360 
it's within the range of what the camera
can<00:03:51.930> see<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.349> great<00:03:52.530> example<00:03:52.590> for<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.159> if

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
can see so a great example for this if
