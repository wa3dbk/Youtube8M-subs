00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
average and compacted them today would

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
average and compacted them today would
be<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.660> day<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.110> would<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.500> paid

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
be the first day that we would get paid

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.209

so<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.539> yes<00:00:49.200> yeah<00:00:49.800> well<00:00:50.010> yeah<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so see you there yes yeah well yeah I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.350 
so see you there yes yeah well yeah I
mean<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.910> they're<00:00:51.090> spread<00:00:51.329> out

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
mean it's just that they're spread out

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.639 
mean it's just that they're spread out
throughout<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> year<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> took<00:00:52.500> them

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
throughout the year but if you took them

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
throughout the year but if you took them
all<00:00:52.770> those<00:00:53.070> outside<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.640> together<00:00:53.910> today

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
all those outside them together today

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
all those outside them together today
would<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.230> day<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> rest<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
would be the first day the rest of it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
would be the first day the rest of it
we've<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.219> been<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.579> nothing<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.210> think

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
we've all been for nothing so I think

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.569 
we've all been for nothing so I think
that<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.600> puts<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> impact<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.710> hangnails

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that really puts the impact of hangnails

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.310 
that really puts the impact of hangnails
that<00:00:59.879> people<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.180> putting<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.570> sometimes

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that people are putting in sometimes

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.569 
that people are putting in sometimes
without<00:01:01.469> realizing<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.460> just

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
without realizing it you know just

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
without realizing it you know just

eye<00:02:30.510> thing<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.200> you're<00:02:31.500> right<00:02:31.620> i

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
eye thing and I think you're right i

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.589 
eye thing and I think you're right i
mean<00:02:31.860> i<00:02:32.069> don't<00:02:32.549> want<00:02:32.700> working<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.150> i<00:02:33.180> work<00:02:33.450> for

myself<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.590> all<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.920> people<00:02:35.220> i<00:02:35.280> think

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
myself but for all the people i think

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.520 
myself but for all the people i think
it's<00:02:35.640> turned<00:02:35.880> into<00:02:36.030> not<00:02:36.420> only<00:02:36.470> exploitation<00:02:37.470> i

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it's turned into not only exploitation i

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.319 
it's turned into not only exploitation i
think<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:37.920> unnecessary<00:02:38.329> exploitation

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
think it's unnecessary exploitation

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.910 
think it's unnecessary exploitation
because<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:40.290> you've<00:02:40.620> got<00:02:40.709> people

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
because just because you've got people

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.190 
because just because you've got people
sitting<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.519> staring<00:02:42.329> at<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.720> screen<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
sitting there staring at a screen so

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.110 
sitting there staring at a screen so
that<00:02:43.290> means<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.769> they're<00:02:43.980> doing<00:02:44.250> good<00:02:44.459> work

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that means that they're doing good work

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.030 
that means that they're doing good work
that<00:02:45.450> will<00:02:45.540> lead<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.720> added<00:02:46.110> productivity<00:02:46.860> so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
that will lead to added productivity so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.039 
that will lead to added productivity so
i<00:02:47.069> think<00:02:47.280> even<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.640> behalf<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.569> employers

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
i think even on behalf of the employers

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.050 
i think even on behalf of the employers
themselves<00:02:49.709> input<00:02:50.130> though<00:02:50.489> it's<00:02:50.700> they're<00:02:50.970> not

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
themselves input though it's they're not

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.610 
themselves input though it's they're not
actually<00:02:51.209> getting<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.810> lot<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:51.989> good<00:02:52.200> work<00:02:52.349> out

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
actually getting a lot of good work out
