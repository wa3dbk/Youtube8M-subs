00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.620
 why are generally flaps out 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.780
 the retrofit or tuning 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 Sectors are not legal for one to work 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.080
 plant can be used legally 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.760
 she needs an ece approval gti 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 tested systems you can recognize an e 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.980
 numbers on the silencers 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980
 are attached 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.120
 the allocation of an ece approval 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 gets an exhaust system after that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.870
 The guidelines follow the procedure 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
 in which the stand and driving noise 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 measured wild stock is how is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 the expiration of a stand or driving noise 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.719
 measuring rules at a booth 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.230
 noise measurement is a just the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.930
 Measuring devices at a distance of 50 cm in one 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.760
 angle of 45 degrees and at a height of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.210
 20 centimeters towards the end pipe 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 held 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.580
 moved at a driving noise measurement 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.190
 The vehicle to be tested with a 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.229
 speed from 50 km / h to 1 20 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.420
 meter long test track to at 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.370
 Crossing the starting point is the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.229
 Vehicle with full load accelerates this 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.810
 the end of the test track is complete 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.250
 has crossed throughout 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.930
 operation is in half 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.600
 distance of the test track with a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.740
 distance of 7.5 meters to the middle of the carriageway 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.180
 mdb meter i am christian that that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.470
 laconic gmbh 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.930
 Now that we have the measurement methods 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.280
 Having explained that comes to the point 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 the hitherto on the german market 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.970
 Available systems in the exhaust flap 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.530
 also be controlled by the driver 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.130
 that means you can determine the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 shut up on this topic is on 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.210
 the question you get this exhaust system 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.410
 then also registered if you the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.050
 control itself 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.880
 yes that's possible, but you have to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.649
 keep in mind that then the stand and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.890
 driving noises measurements of the exhaust flap 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.750
 must be measured in the open state 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.490
 and that means the system with 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.170
 exhaust flap should not be louder 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.560
 as your series plant and let's be 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.030
 honestly that does not bring anything to us 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.330
 some manufacturers try the problem 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.330
 to solve 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.650
 Some manufacturers have automatic 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.520
 lying sound control develops the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.380
 not by the driver 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.270
 can be influenced in the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.950
 usually did not fend off the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.380
 Phenological control very much 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.090
 important because then, for example 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.160
 a flap only on the speed 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.590
 would be and in the normal 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.470
 Departments st 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.750
 50 and 80 km h can be decided 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.980
 driving under full load for example 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.900
 during acceleration phases on the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.819
 Highway 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.010
 also lead to extreme heat congestion or 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.239
 Too much high exhaust gas pressure and 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.010
 everyone who deals with the topic 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.200
 knows this is white 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.200
 suboptimal is for such vehicles 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.379
 how does the policy actually work? 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.660
 the black swan extra device attacks 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.700
 several relevant parameters of kemper's 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.410
 off and a logical and ece confirma 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.720
 Control the flap to ensure 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.670
 so must be in the calculation mode 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.489
 Values ​​such as gas pedal and throttle valves 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.209
 position speed 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.390
 sensors and other parameters 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.790
 I want to realize that 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.799
 Politics controlled the EC reliably 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.690
 compliant pollution and keeps the 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:28.920
 exhaust flap in the deeply relevant area 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:32.540
 Closed as the police action 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.540
 We'll show you now
