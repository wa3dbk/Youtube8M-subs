00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.910
 Hello and welcome are 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.620
 includes hardware software reviews in 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.270
 this video is about the brand new one 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.330
 giggs 67 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.680
 from the board partner gigabyte in this 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 case these are the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.220
 gigabyte gtx 260 windforce 3x version 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.320
 matching product links and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.939
 Incidentally, information is below here 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the video description so easy 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.670
 take a look 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 typical of graphics cards both gtx 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.359
 graphics cards as well as dts hd 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.100
 graphics cards designed this packaging 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.140
 but very simple but very much 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.210
 nice and informative among them 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.850
 example this picture of this eye 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.399
 but also the technical information 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.870
 Which graphics card is concerned 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.239
 how much graphic city is available 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.850
 But we also have the wind here 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.519
 fund three cows and that we have here 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.740
 also have the uc version on the 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.260
 back of this packaging we see 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 including the link fund 3 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.780
 köhler like this designed or too 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.150
 but we also developed that here 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.280
 have the pci express 3.0 connection 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.170
 as well as natural further information 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.330
 will be given to me here but to me 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.490
 also in the remaining part of the video 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.130
 Therefore, we'll leave now 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.890
 this pack here and panning directly 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.750
 over to the product typical of gigabit 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.750
 graphics card is the graphics card velvet 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.550
 soup delivered in an extra carton 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.830
 Of course, this also includes one 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.840
 optimal protection of the video card but 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.760
 I 've already prepared that and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.360
 Here we have the new one 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.010
 gtx 67 from gigabyte accessories 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.090
 This graphics card is not special 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.230
 lush made yet but sufficient to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.550
 enough information about this 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.290
 to get the video card 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.890
 including but also a guide how 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.180
 I because this graphics card now obauung 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.960
 also an adapter can it from 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.400
 twice monex on a 6 pin connection 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.050
 and a summer moniques connection too 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.110
 an 8 pin power connection 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.150
 Furthermore, the drivers cd I recommend 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.250
 you but at this point the newest 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.490
 drivers from the nvidia page for free 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.280
 we have here now 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.820
 the new gtx 460 from boardpartner 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.520
 gigabyte in the infobox 3 version 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.590
 windforce 3 means nothing else 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.780
 Here we have the wind force cool with 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.320
 three axiallüfter with a diameter 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.540
 of 80 millimeters this is essential 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.940
 better but also quieter and is thus 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.340
 optimally suitable for this graphics card 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.650
 in comparison to this is the trunk and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.260
 Reference cooler from the video below 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.790
 not to use other things 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.670
 on the top we see for example 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.210
 but also the lettering next to it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.350
 the connections for the sti operation here 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.000
 At the top right we see the 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.330
 power supply connections you can see 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520
 here 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.850
 we have a 6 and a night here 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.550
 the pci express power connection on the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.400
 back at the area we find several 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.490
 connections including dvi twice but 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.560
 also hdmi and displayport also here 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.240
 gigabyte made the slotblende like that 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.490
 that works out the waste heat from direction 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.030
 gpu direction back of the housing dissipated 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.650
 can be cooler through the fund 3 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.300
 here to see the pci express 3.0 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.350
 Of course, this connection is also possible 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.500
 backwards compatible with the pci express 2.0 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.980
 connection 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.840
 on the back of the video card becomes 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.180
 gives us an insight into that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.890
 Cooling system of this graphics card with the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.940
 windforce 3x cooler 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.770
 Here we also find the 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.570
 heat sink even with the individual 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.200
 heatpipes in this case come here 3 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.740
 copper heatpipes for use as one 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.530
 see here 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.560
 typical of graphics cards is here 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.080
 Box pcb in a turquoise color 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.820
 shade used and thus we have 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.860
 a full pcb 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.870
 for example, but this is also 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.810
 graphics card with a short pzb 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.540
 equipped by such as for example 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.310
 however we have a full pcb here 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.609
 in my opinion a lot 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.459
 The gtx 460 looks more beautiful in the u10 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.870
 variant of gigabyte delivers us the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.700
 gag on 104 2 125 a 2 chip that means 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.360
 we have a facelift of 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.060
 well-known 104 chips already in 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.450
 the 6th 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.169
 600 series were installed the gpu 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.590
 itself clocks in a base clock of 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:44.919
 1085 march and has a boost act of 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.340
 1051 more heart also in this gtx 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:52.210
 69 understand and 2 gb graphic memory to 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:56.020
 disposal of a clock of 1502 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:59.680
 march clocks we have here as already 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.990
 addressed a 256 image graphics card 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.830
 and we are also in here 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 together 1152 shader units to 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.580
 disposal 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.150
 According to Gigabyte, the TDP amounts 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.520
 this graphics card on 170 watts in the 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.200
 idling is even only 11.9 watts 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.250
 through the axial fan system 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.080
 or by the three 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.930
 axiallüfter is of course rather this 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.919
 graphics card very well suited for that 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.750
 overclock 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.889
 if the clocks are not timing like that 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.080
 you can certainly still be enough 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.970
 some more household like already on 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.970
 At the beginning this is addressed to us 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.150
 graphics card course se connections in 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.120
 In this case we can have two more 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.960
 graphics cards of the gtx 260 series 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.860
 and thus can be a freeware system 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.070
 build up 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.600
 Of course, the GTX 67 is a relative one 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.830
 big boobs to the times too 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.090
 I have clarified here once 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.950
 comparatively an old 550 ti before 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.620
 positioned and you can see everyone 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.720
 case here that 's 67 though it does 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.660
 a relatively small version of one 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.400
 graphics card is relatively large that comes 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.220
 especially by the gigabyte is 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.530
 specific pcb what he developed himself 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.300
 was and should always be in the 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.860
 behind the head both that too 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.229
 graphics card very long and natural 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:24.280
 this must also fit into the pc 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:27.970
 otherwise the gtx 67 27 5 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.820
 she is 13 6 inches long ready 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.700
 centimeters and in height it measures 43 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.789
 cm yes then it should have been to 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.760
 new gtx him 68 full gigabytes in the 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:41.800
 in fund 3d version at this point 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.630
 I would of course like a clock 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.910
 looking forward from you provided that the 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.560
 If you have further suggestions 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.940
 and ask, please let me know 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.050
 by a comment or a 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.120
 personal message 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.100
 otherwise I would of course over 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.540
 an abo of the happy and the next 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.280
 video is about it then 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.740
 graphics card just a little bit too 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.630
 test with current play then up 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.630
 next time judgment must be
