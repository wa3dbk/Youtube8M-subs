00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.160 
let's feed Lisi again a big stop for
Georgia<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.580> Jones<00:06:07.940> cannot<00:06:08.510> handle<00:06:09.050> the

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
Georgia and Jones cannot handle the

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.410 
Georgia and Jones cannot handle the
finesse<00:06:09.500> block<00:06:09.770> this<00:06:10.070> time<00:06:10.310> he<00:06:10.880> gets<00:06:11.090> driven

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
finesse block this time he gets driven

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.750 
finesse block this time he gets driven
right<00:06:11.750> back<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.350> that's<00:06:12.950> a<00:06:13.100> great<00:06:13.370> stop<00:06:13.730> by

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
right back and that's a great stop by

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.670 
right back and that's a great stop by
the<00:06:14.030> nose<00:06:14.270> tackle<00:06:14.570> shut<00:06:15.020> them<00:06:15.170> right<00:06:15.350> into<00:06:15.560> the

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680
