00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
explosion out of the game because it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
explosion out of the game because it
wasn't<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.790> spell<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.869> actually

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
wasn't really a spell I use to actually

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
wasn't really a spell I use to actually
do<00:01:28.409> damage<00:01:28.860> even<00:01:29.070> though<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> did<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> was

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
do damage even though it did and it was

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700 
do damage even though it did and it was
a<00:01:30.180> nice<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.509> side<00:01:30.780> effect<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.500> just

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
a nice little side effect but I just

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
a nice little side effect but I just
loved<00:01:31.979> watching<00:01:32.250> corpses<00:01:33.060> explode<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
loved watching corpses explode and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
before Blizzard hot fixed it it was

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.219 
before Blizzard hot fixed it it was

the<00:01:45.630> corpse<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> lot<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> QQ

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the corpse and there's a lot of QQ

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.670 
the corpse and there's a lot of QQ
because<00:01:47.810> before<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.170> couldn't<00:01:49.530> actually

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
because before you couldn't actually

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.370 
because before you couldn't actually
skin<00:01:50.369> mobs<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> had<00:01:51.329> been<00:01:51.540> exploded<00:01:52.259> because

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
skin mobs that had been exploded because

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.139 
skin mobs that had been exploded because
obviously<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:53.070> run<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.700> piece<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
obviously they run in one piece so it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.670 
obviously they run in one piece so it
made<00:01:54.420> sense<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.020> couldn't<00:01:55.290> skin<00:01:55.500> them

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
made sense that you couldn't skin them

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.560 
made sense that you couldn't skin them
right<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> QQ<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
right but then with all the QQ and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.230 
right but then with all the QQ and
everything<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> wanted<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> skin<00:01:59.310> lizard

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
everything and I wanted to skin lizard

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.700 
everything and I wanted to skin lizard
then<00:02:00.390> had<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> hock<00:02:00.840> fix<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
then had to hock fix it so that you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.700 
then had to hock fix it so that you
could<00:02:01.979> steal<00:02:02.310> skin<00:02:02.790> exploded<00:02:03.659> corpses<00:02:04.229> which

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
could steal skin exploded corpses which

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
could steal skin exploded corpses which
makes<00:02:05.040> no<00:02:05.130> sense<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.640> me<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.030> yet<00:02:06.270> okay

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
makes no sense to me but yet okay

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.540 
makes no sense to me but yet okay
whatever<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:07.829> took<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.280> spell

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
whatever but then they took the spell

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
whatever but then they took the spell
out<00:02:08.729> completely<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.420> don't<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.739> was

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
out completely I don't see what it was

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.270 
out completely I don't see what it was
you<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.879> why<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.690> hurting<00:02:13.200> anyone

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
you know why it was hurting anyone

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.010 
you know why it was hurting anyone
to<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.430> able<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> explode<00:02:15.150> corpses<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.840> thought

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
to be able to explode corpses I thought

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.930 
to be able to explode corpses I thought
it<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.350> fantastic<00:02:16.800> looking<00:02:17.250> spell<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.850> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
it was a fantastic looking spell and it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.240 
it was a fantastic looking spell and it
always<00:02:18.209> brought<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.080> laugh<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.740> evade<00:02:20.040> or

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
always brought a laugh to evade or

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.820 
always brought a laugh to evade or
whatever<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.970> yeah<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> really

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
whatever and yeah it was just a really

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.740 
whatever and yeah it was just a really
cool<00:02:23.069> graphic<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.240> was<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
cool graphic and it was one of the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.380 
cool graphic and it was one of the
reasons<00:02:24.959> why<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> had<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.430> much<00:02:26.459> enjoyment<00:02:26.850> on

reasons why I had so much enjoyment on

when I controlled them they didn't
shrink<00:03:03.180> which<00:03:03.930> I'm<00:03:04.200> sure<00:03:04.470> they'll<00:03:04.769> probably

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
shrink which I'm sure they'll probably

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.000 
shrink which I'm sure they'll probably
make<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.239> they<00:03:06.390> shrink<00:03:06.690> because<00:03:07.140> yeah

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
make it so that they shrink because yeah

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.770 
make it so that they shrink because yeah

them<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.490> bit<00:05:08.640> like<00:05:08.849> when<00:05:09.030> hunters<00:05:09.419> tame<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.050> new

pet and the pet shrinks to the
appropriate<00:05:13.140> size<00:05:13.349> although<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.550> fun<00:05:14.880> to

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
appropriate size although it is fun to

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.360 
appropriate size although it is fun to
be<00:05:15.180> having<00:05:15.510> these<00:05:15.690> colossal<00:05:16.440> Giants<00:05:17.190> of

undead minions following me around and

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.469 
undead minions following me around and
doing<00:05:19.890> my<00:05:20.130> bidding<00:05:20.340> it's<00:05:20.970> not<00:05:21.270> really

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
doing my bidding it's not really

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.779 
doing my bidding it's not really
practical<00:05:21.810> if<00:05:22.349> you're<00:05:22.530> inside<00:05:22.950> a<00:05:23.190> dungeon<00:05:23.610> you

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
practical if you're inside a dungeon you

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.600 
practical if you're inside a dungeon you
wouldn't<00:05:24.000> be<00:05:24.150> able<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.450> in<00:05:24.840> theory<00:05:25.470> fit<00:05:26.310> one<00:05:26.490> of

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
wouldn't be able to in theory fit one of

wouldn't be able to in theory fit one of
these<00:05:26.789> inside<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.300> dungeon<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:28.020> yeah<00:05:28.349> I'm<00:05:28.620> sure

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
these inside a dungeon so yeah I'm sure

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.040 
these inside a dungeon so yeah I'm sure
it'll<00:05:29.070> get<00:05:29.190> shrunk<00:05:29.430> but<00:05:30.210> hopefully<00:05:30.570> they'll

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
it'll get shrunk but hopefully they'll

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.600 
it'll get shrunk but hopefully they'll
keep<00:05:31.229> this<00:05:31.409> spell<00:05:31.680> in<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.890> game<00:05:32.070> and<00:05:32.250> not<00:05:32.370> deem

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
keep this spell in the game and not deem

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.550 
keep this spell in the game and not deem
it<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:32.820> be<00:05:32.909> Opie<00:05:33.360> or<00:05:33.479> anything<00:05:33.840> because<00:05:34.020> it's

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
it to be Opie or anything because it's

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.380
