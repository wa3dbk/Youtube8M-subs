00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.129
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.500
 stellar quadrilateral where we are going to measure 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.490
 technologically speaking in a duel to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.949
 iphone 5 let's measure against your enemy 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.619
 top number 1 on android side 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.029
 Unlike is the htc one so 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 I hope you like this comparison 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 you have a lot to say in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.850
 this comparative because I need your 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.680
 I support your comments to see 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 who is the one who has really won 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.970
 in this duel tell you that I am sergio 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 navas and you can find me on twitter 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.230
 by arroba es navas 10 and on facebook by 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.230
 aysÃ©n a code we started the duel 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.870
 let's start because terminal has 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.370
 the screen better the one that looks better the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.170
 which has more size which is more 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.000
 productive when mostly about 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.380
 this is the main and not usable that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.300
 we will only do a little bit later 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.220
 tell you that the htc one has a 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.310
 4.7 inch screen with a 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.180
 pixel density of 468 pixels per 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.640
 inch and a resolution of 1920 x 1080 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.440
 really spectacular the screen of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.930
 iPhone 5 is also not far behind 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.180
 It has a 4 inch screen in 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.880
 aspect ratio 16 ninth and has 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.960
 a pixel density of 1132 x 640 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 pixels what makes a density of 328 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.830
 pixels per inch the truth is that a 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.869
 glance not much difference the 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.399
 two look equally good roughly 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.380
 not what it is true that the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.399
 screen is much bigger in the htc 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.710
 one 4.7 with respect to 4 of the iphone 5 no and 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.860
 in this case since the screen more 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.420
 or less are equal in quality but the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.560
 htd one screen is bigger 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.320
 It also has a higher pixel density 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.280
 I think here has a positive point 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.280
 the htc equal 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.320
 well now let's talk about the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.670
 usability that the device I believe 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.590
 At least this is an opinion 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.920
 staff that is more productive more 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.020
 usable i think the iphone has all 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.760
 buttons accessible with one hand 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.380
 we can control any kind of 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.000
 problem we will arrive as you are 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.580
 watching the power button at 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.080
 mute volume controllers 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.790
 also note that from the bottom 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.380
 the speakers and the microphone is 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.390
 completely discovered although what 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.550
 let's take it as we take it with our hands 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.290
 we are going to cover it and we arrive at all the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.880
 areas of the screen practically 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
 although the center notifications costs 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.260
 a little bit of arriving with one hand 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.880
 in agreement this is quite comfortable the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.560
 htd one by against as has the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.110
 bigger screen is a little bit more 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.060
 uncomfortable at the time of using it in fact it 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.470
 they have insisted on putting good I'm going to 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.850
 comment on the home button first 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.010
 example I also think that it would have 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.660
 to be in the center because the truth 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.980
 is that being on one side for right-handed 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.959
 it's a bit uncomfortable because it 's 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.700
 too close and for lefties it is 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.290
 possibly it is possible that it is quite 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.060
 ideal not but I think you will have to 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.980
 have put in the center also what 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.120
 I was telling you before is that the power button 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.350
 they have put it up I would have 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.000
 put a side because the truth that 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.100
 It costs a lot to get there and obviously 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.830
 the screen 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.900
 because with one hand it costs a little 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.520
 of driving and not the entire population of 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.440
 world world will be able to use it to 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.710
 one hand I think that here wins the 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.710
 iphone 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 another of the most important points is the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.400
 photo camera in the video camera 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.500
 Right now we are seeing a 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.590
 dark photography using the flash 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.450
 made with the htc one 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.920
 and this photograph is also made 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.530
 the same conditions but with the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.989
 iphone5 this photograph is made with 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.910
 the htc one so in close macro plan and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.650
 now the same photograph but made with 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.599
 the iphone 5 let's take a picture now 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.670
 well of a landscape like that in the background so 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.510
 see with enough daylight of agreement 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.940
 these facts from one 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.500
 this is iphone 5 and now let's see the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.150
 video the times that are quite 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.370
 evenly matched and this is the video recorded with 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.720
 the htc one to notice that it really looks 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.690
 very well the colors look very good 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.360
 maybe I do not touch the stabilizer 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.950
 video works fine but it works I think 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 that a little better on the iphone 5 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.910
 because this recording is made with the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.769
 iphone 5 and I think I think it gives me the impression 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.200
 that the video stabilizer works 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.569
 a little bit better that's why I think that as 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.420
 the camera is 4 megapixels the htc and 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.840
 of 8 on the iphone 5 I think he wins the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.840
 iphone 5 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.120
 Well, let's talk a little bit about the 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.820
 multimedia aspects where I think the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.990
 htc one here takes the game to set 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.270
 that is pointing where are the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.620
 speakers in the htc and now on the iphone 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.570
 5 we are seeing that in the part of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.400
 down we have speaker and microphone that 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.020
 it's fine it's discovered but nothing that 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.940
 see with the htc because we have them in the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.040
 front and this is going to make 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.320
 sound spectacularly good but this 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.500
 it's not all because you notice that these 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.900
 htc speakers have certification of 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.610
 audio beats that are I do not know if they are 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.500
 good or bad but they sound like really 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.820
 of luxury and the truth is that the 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.400
 understood they say they are very good 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.400
 obviously also the htc screen 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.710
 is 47 inches larger than 4 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.300
 inches of the iphone 5 therefore this 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.980
 will do that in the videos either 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.410
 youtube either any type of video 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.720
 let's enjoy the content a little more 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.580
 even also reading therefore I 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.200
 I think the multimedia theme though 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.010
 both are very stable i think ghana 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.010
 the htc 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.150
 Well now let's talk about 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.370
 power and first of all I want to leave 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.500
 clear that the two are the most powerful 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.230
 of the market or at least they are in the 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.390
 top 3 both of the most powerful teams 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.370
 of the market so good even if I win 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.470
 one then does not mean that the other 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.090
 be bad according the two are 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.740
 really very good but good we're going to 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.170
 start doing a test 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.300
 web browser speed we are going to 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.980
 compare chrome with safari in each 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.440
 of these teams we are going to go to our 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.420
 web page code page dot net and 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.910
 note that the winner is 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.250
 let's see they are finishing the iphone 5 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.990
 the iphone 5 ordered on the website 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.090
 of design with net point quite more 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.460
 fast but that has made the htc that 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.050
 still not finished to see to see if 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.140
 well the line has finished perfect 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.610
 He has won, almost by a landslide, 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.260
 iphone 5 but the truth is that this is 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.540
 a lot of objective is not very important 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.370
 note that the fluency is pretty good 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.560
 in both terminals equally of 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.440
 agreement and although loading on the pages 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.440
 iphone 5 more quickly hey look 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.090
 is not that the htc is slow in not me 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.590
 it seems a bad terminal because of this but not 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.689
 Well, it's just a fact that 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.610
 like and we are going to do 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.199
 make this post for you to see a 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.939
 little bit so you can see that 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.219
 it has not been casual and i miss font five 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.509
 wins again with enough 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.429
 advantage because you can still see the line has already 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.899
 finished a little bit of advantage either 

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:40.429
 It has been as much as before but good has 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.929
 finished before we will load a 

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:44.599
 video game ok let's hit the same 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:46.519
 of the game the real racing 3 in both 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.139
 terminals at once so come on let's go 

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.539
 over there to see which one loads before because this 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.579
 yes that's the test of fire here this 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.289
 is in total performance in a video game 

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.740
 last generation of the most powerful 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.569
 what we have 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.849
 and how are you seeing the iphone5 has 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:02.220
 loaded first you 're going to put the 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:04.800
 animation now comes out the logo in the htc 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.199
 good to see that you have loaded before 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.449
 iphone5 seems to be more powerful than the 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.930
 htc one but for a little bit so they arrive 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.930
 to iphone 5 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.690
 then we come to the end of this video 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.539
 comparative where we have compared the 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.009
 iphone5 with the htc one this video has 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.990
 been possible thanks to factory 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.780
 mobile.com that is the one that has given me the 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.240
 htc one to be able to analyze it as we have 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.610
 done all these days good and now what 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.110
