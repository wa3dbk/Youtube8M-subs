00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
this one I do think that Stephanie

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
crowd a big payoff because I think

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.760 
crowd a big payoff because I think
Stephanie<00:02:27.630> McMahon<00:02:27.870> does<00:02:28.140> understand<00:02:28.620> that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
Stephanie McMahon does understand that

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.620

AJ lost on Raw going into the SummerSlam
so<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.950> my<00:03:14.730> booking<00:03:15.180> perspective<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.170> says

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
so in my booking perspective that says

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.620 
so in my booking perspective that says
she's<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.340> beat<00:03:17.700> Paige<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
she's going to beat Paige at the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.840 
she's going to beat Paige at the
SummerSlam<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.890> she<00:03:20.130> does<00:03:20.280> beat<00:03:20.460> Paige<00:03:20.670> at

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
SummerSlam but she does beat Paige at

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.520 
SummerSlam but she does beat Paige at
the<00:03:20.910> last<00:03:21.120> pay-per-view<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.870> two<00:03:21.930> wins<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
the last pay-per-view so two wins in a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.990 
the last pay-per-view so two wins in a
row<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.830> kind<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.070> really<00:03:23.280> diminishes<00:03:23.610> Paige

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
row that kind of really diminishes Paige

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.630 
row that kind of really diminishes Paige
but<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:24.660> still<00:03:24.930> putting<00:03:25.140> my<00:03:25.290> money<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.710> AJ

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
but I'm still putting my money on AJ

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.220 
but I'm still putting my money on AJ
then<00:03:27.030> there's<00:03:27.210> gonna<00:03:27.270> be<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.510> flag<00:03:27.930> match

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
then there's gonna be a flag match

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.400 
then there's gonna be a flag match
between<00:03:28.620> Jack<00:03:29.160> Swagger<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:30.000> rusev<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.080> I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
between Jack Swagger and rusev and I

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.960 
between Jack Swagger and rusev and I
think<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.680> object<00:03:32.100> here<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.400> get<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.760> flag

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
think the object here is to get the flag

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.520 
think the object here is to get the flag
it's<00:03:33.210> kind<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.630> flag<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.050> pole<00:03:34.320> match

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
it's kind of like a flag on a pole match

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.990 
it's kind of like a flag on a pole match
but<00:03:35.040> they<00:03:35.100> can't<00:03:35.280> call<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.460> a<00:03:35.490> flag<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.850> pole

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
but they can't call it a flag on a pole

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.070 
but they can't call it a flag on a pole
match<00:03:36.150> because<00:03:36.360> that's<00:03:36.510> where<00:03:36.660> fucking<00:03:36.900> flag

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
match because that's where fucking flag

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.380 
match because that's where fucking flag
goes<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.530> put<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> flag<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.040> pole<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.240> what

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
goes and put a flag on a pole so what

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.220 
goes and put a flag on a pole so what
I'm<00:03:39.480> pretty<00:03:39.630> sure<00:03:39.810> you're<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:39.960> do<00:03:40.170> is

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
certain that Jack Swagger is gonna win

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.930 
certain that Jack Swagger is gonna win
this<00:03:48.570> because<00:03:49.020> rusev<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.100> lose<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.640> not<00:03:50.730> look

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
