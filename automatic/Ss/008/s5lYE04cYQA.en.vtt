let's<00:04:10.410> see<00:04:10.590> compared<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.069> Franco<00:04:11.370> Harris<00:04:11.519> so

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
let's see compared to Franco Harris so

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.860 
let's see compared to Franco Harris so
Franco<00:04:12.389> Harris<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.780> little<00:04:12.989> bit<00:04:13.109> faster<00:04:13.500> but

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
Franco Harris is a little bit faster but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.960 
Franco Harris is a little bit faster but
86<00:04:15.870> catching<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:17.010> still<00:04:17.250> dump<00:04:17.430> passes<00:04:17.669> off

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
86 catching I can still dump passes off

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.150 
86 catching I can still dump passes off
and<00:04:18.269> he's<00:04:19.229> great<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.500> my<00:04:19.709> running<00:04:20.010> plays

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
and he's great for my running plays

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.510 
and he's great for my running plays
hit<00:04:21.940> up<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.180> defense<00:04:23.160> kam<00:04:24.160> chancellor

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
hit up the defense kam chancellor

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.880 
hit up the defense kam chancellor
obviously<00:04:25.150> plus<00:04:25.450> one<00:04:25.630> speed<00:04:25.900> that's<00:04:26.620> awesome

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
obviously plus one speed that's awesome

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.580 
obviously plus one speed that's awesome
I<00:04:27.390> flipped<00:04:28.390> around<00:04:28.540> Tracy<00:04:29.050> Porter<00:04:29.320> and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
I flipped around Tracy Porter and

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.980 
I flipped around Tracy Porter and
Richard<00:04:29.860> Sherman<00:04:30.220> because<00:04:30.610> Tracy<00:04:31.480> Porter<00:04:31.750> was

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
Richard Sherman because Tracy Porter was

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.850 
Richard Sherman because Tracy Porter was
getting<00:04:32.290> burned<00:04:33.960> Harrison<00:04:34.960> Smith<00:04:35.200> is<00:04:35.380> my<00:04:35.650> new

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
getting burned Harrison Smith is my new

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.100 
getting burned Harrison Smith is my new
free<00:04:36.640> safety<00:04:37.090> because<00:04:37.420> I'm<00:04:37.540> pretty<00:04:37.720> sure<00:04:37.990> he

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
free safety because I'm pretty sure he

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.860 
free safety because I'm pretty sure he
has<00:04:38.200> better<00:04:38.410> coverage<00:04:38.710> than<00:04:38.950> Earl<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.870> Earls

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
has better coverage than Earl and Earls

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.020 
has better coverage than Earl and Earls
really<00:04:41.170> just<00:04:41.410> in<00:04:41.590> because<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.610> plus<00:04:42.820> two

the stats him compared to DeAndre Levy

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.340 
the stats him compared to DeAndre Levy
not<00:04:55.510> even<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.810> competition<00:04:57.210> Demario<00:04:58.210> Davis<00:04:58.350> got

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
him from the positional hero set like I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.870 
him from the positional hero set like I
was<00:05:01.660> trying<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.930> show<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.140> guys<00:05:02.640> earlier<00:05:03.640> this

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
was trying to show you guys earlier this

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.300 
was trying to show you guys earlier this
morning<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.390> guess<00:05:04.570> because<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:04.960> was<00:05:05.050> 1am<00:05:05.320> but

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
morning I guess because it was 1am but

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.430 
morning I guess because it was 1am but
he's<00:05:06.610> much<00:05:07.030> better<00:05:07.300> than<00:05:07.570> Jack<00:05:07.810> Lambert<00:05:08.110> I

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
he's much better than Jack Lambert I

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.140 
he's much better than Jack Lambert I
don't<00:05:09.220> know<00:05:09.310> what<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.430> do<00:05:09.580> with<00:05:09.700> Jack<00:05:09.910> Lambert

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
don't know what to do with Jack Lambert

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.360 
don't know what to do with Jack Lambert
anymore<00:05:10.650> probably<00:05:11.650> gonna<00:05:11.860> sell<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.250> make<00:05:12.340> a

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
anymore probably gonna sell and make a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.950 
anymore probably gonna sell and make a
couple<00:05:12.610> million<00:05:12.940> because<00:05:13.240> even<00:05:13.540> when<00:05:13.660> he's<00:05:13.780> in

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
couple million because even when he's in

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.050 
couple million because even when he's in
he<00:05:14.110> doesn't<00:05:14.380> increase<00:05:14.620> my<00:05:14.800> overall<00:05:15.220> so

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
he doesn't increase my overall so

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.690 
he doesn't increase my overall so
there's<00:05:16.330> really<00:05:16.450> no<00:05:16.780> point<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.140> keeping<00:05:17.290> him

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.830 

so<00:05:21.700> yeah<00:05:21.850> you<00:05:21.910> can<00:05:22.120> see<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.450> coverage

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
so yeah you can see that the coverage

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.010 
so yeah you can see that the coverage
really<00:05:23.170> isn't<00:05:23.440> there<00:05:24.630> but<00:05:25.630> who<00:05:26.260> else<00:05:27.990> we<00:05:28.990> got

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
really isn't there but who else we got

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.240 
really isn't there but who else we got
Deacon<00:05:29.830> Jones<00:05:30.540> obviously<00:05:31.950> people<00:05:32.950> have<00:05:33.130> found

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
Deacon Jones obviously people have found

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.330 
Deacon Jones obviously people have found
the<00:05:33.400> glitch<00:05:33.580> room<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.950> producing<00:05:35.950> this<00:05:36.100> bad

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
the glitch room to producing this bad

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.810 
the glitch room to producing this bad
boy<00:05:36.960> really<00:05:37.960> not<00:05:38.140> that<00:05:38.320> great<00:05:38.500> of<00:05:38.740> stats<00:05:39.160> he's

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
boy really not that great of stats he's

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.520 
boy really not that great of stats he's
obviously<00:05:40.090> better<00:05:40.540> than<00:05:40.750> DeMarcus<00:05:41.140> mayor<00:05:41.320> but

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
obviously better than DeMarcus mayor but

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.440 
obviously better than DeMarcus mayor but
then<00:05:41.650> if<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.860> look<00:05:41.980> at<00:05:42.130> Cameron<00:05:42.460> Wake<00:05:42.610> he's

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
then if you look at Cameron Wake he's

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.950 
then if you look at Cameron Wake he's
really<00:05:43.990> not<00:05:44.260> that<00:05:44.410> much<00:05:44.530> better<00:05:45.270> but<00:05:46.270> gotta

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
really not that much better but gotta

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.990 
really not that much better but gotta

move on guys let's talk about the glitch
it's<00:06:04.840> a<00:06:04.930> very<00:06:05.080> small<00:06:05.320> glitch<00:06:05.560> it's<00:06:05.770> not<00:06:05.890> even

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
it's a very small glitch it's not even

it's a very small glitch it's not even
helpful<00:06:06.280> in<00:06:06.490> anyway<00:06:06.730> it's<00:06:07.390> just<00:06:07.570> kind<00:06:07.720> of<00:06:07.780> neat

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
helpful in anyway it's just kind of neat

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.570 
helpful in anyway it's just kind of neat
but<00:06:10.230> maybe<00:06:11.230> this<00:06:11.530> was<00:06:11.740> how<00:06:11.860> people<00:06:12.220> found<00:06:12.430> out

but maybe this was how people found out
about<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:13.030> glitch<00:06:13.240> in<00:06:13.419> the<00:06:13.510> first<00:06:13.780> place<00:06:13.960> I

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
about the glitch in the first place I

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.020 
about the glitch in the first place I
doubt<00:06:15.130> it<00:06:15.600> scratch<00:06:16.600> that<00:06:16.630> but<00:06:17.700> let's<00:06:18.700> go<00:06:18.880> down

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
doubt it scratch that but let's go down

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.810 
doubt it scratch that but let's go down
here<00:06:19.060> to<00:06:19.240> Jordan<00:06:19.830> one<00:06:20.830> of<00:06:20.950> the<00:06:21.070> members<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.430> the
