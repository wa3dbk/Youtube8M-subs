 Se-no! Nice to meet you is the man in the man MR. MR 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.789
 It was finally formed for "ON AIR-night flight" 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.529
 It's time to announce the name of the new idol group 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.900
 Wait a minute Wait a minute Wait a minute 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.239
 Speaking of which I was trying to announce myself while I was not 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.100
 I heard that is true? 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.489
 No way! While there is no leader Yunak senior 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.320
 I can not do that 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.300
 Yup 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300

 What's this! 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.600
 Then Yunak seniors also came, so do you really want to announce 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.360
 It is good, there were really many applications 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.570
 Thank you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.760
 Then pay attention 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.100
 Actually I already know the name of the group 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.300
 You know that only Yunak senior ... ... 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 Yup 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.400

 The names of us who were to be active in the musical "ON AIR-Night Flight"- 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.610
 It is "SPARK" 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.820
 Huh? 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 The producer just received from "Aki" 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.540
 It says that it was decided to be "SPARK" ... 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 Ahh... 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.490
 Hey, in the habit of the youngest 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.450
 In the habit of the youngest child 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.050
 It is crap 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.780
 Sloppy 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.520
 Unfair! 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.909
 Yes yes everyone yes everyone 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.549
