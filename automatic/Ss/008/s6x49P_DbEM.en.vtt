00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:09.019
 true friends then this spark plug are 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.890
 calibrated to 32 bits 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.320
 let's see if indeed 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.320
 they are 32 elements 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.850
 is it so 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.070
 to see if these women should go to 32 that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.080
 causes if they go to 25 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.290
 the spark did not reach out 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.360
 perfectly and then I will explain the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.129
 spark without a very small bit and the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.960
 spark of jumping in this space in 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.020
 about to turn on and the environment 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.500
 fuel that would cause us excess 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.449
 fuel consumption 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 then we will have to calibrate the 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.300
 until we are going to put our new 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.540
 let's put our new spark plugs 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:03.949
 remember that they go to 54 55 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:09.870
 point 0 54 points 0 55 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:12.700
 thousandths of thumb 154 and we're going to 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.850
 proceed to put the spark plugs 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.200
 here is our region equal water 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.789
 original frame because he asked the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.030
 client let's calibrate how much the 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:29.170
 opening is between the central electrode and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.170
 the side electrode if we are going to put them 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.490
 so we put it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.490
 and it must be 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.450
 54 see 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:47.650
 there is the 54 we were talking about a 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.430
 little bit of pain one slowly and there it is 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.320
 now yes the 54 truth let's proceed 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.690
 now yes to increase all our 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.610
 spark plugs of 1350 of 46 those of ford are of 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.710
 very thick platinum which I use 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.200
 which are others and if they have platinum very 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.940
 delgadito see you are very 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.270
 delgadito not metal so strong the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.640
 calibrator because they will break it yes 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:21.690
 perfect let's go then to put now if 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.690
 our women are the same 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.420
 the same tool is the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.950
 reverse procedure to many people me 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.090
 says is not that you can get to 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.230
 grab the nuts 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.510
 I always put them with this system and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.860
 it is because of false I use it like this all the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.560
 time is very safe let's put a 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.440
 little oil in the spark plugs of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.280
 values ​​and so that between is better not 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.280
 let's have problems
