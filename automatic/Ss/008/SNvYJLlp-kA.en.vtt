the<00:00:11.670> mandatory<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.269> pretty<00:00:12.450> much<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.840> row

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the mandatory is pretty much in a row

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.299 
the mandatory is pretty much in a row
I'm<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> throw<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.009> couple<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
I'm going to throw in a couple of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.099 
I'm going to throw in a couple of
variations<00:00:14.580> here<00:00:15.030> but<00:00:15.269> you're<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
variations here but you're going to

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.900 
variations here but you're going to
notice<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.740> smooth<00:00:17.039> flow<00:00:17.250> between<00:00:17.520> one

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
notice that the smooth flow between one

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370 
notice that the smooth flow between one
pose<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.600> other<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> be<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
pose and the other is going to be the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.410 
pose and the other is going to be the
key<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.369> actually<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.970> be<00:00:21.060> used<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
key this actually can be used as a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509 
key this actually can be used as a
routine<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.130> set<00:00:23.310> some

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
routine all you have to do is set some

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
routine all you have to do is set some
music<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.539> you'll<00:00:24.689> notice<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.109> just

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
music to it but you'll notice I'm just

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.500 
music to it but you'll notice I'm just
flowing<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.830> pose<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.430> another<00:00:26.730> again

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
flowing from one pose to another again

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109 
flowing from one pose to another again
the<00:00:27.660> hands<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.050> very<00:00:28.080> loose<00:00:28.880> okay<00:00:29.880> I'm

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the hands are very loose okay I'm

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
the hands are very loose okay I'm
basically<00:00:30.660> using<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> two-step<00:00:31.529> approach<00:00:31.710> one

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
basically using a two-step approach one

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.709 
basically using a two-step approach one
two<00:00:33.270> three<00:00:34.100> okay<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.850> two-step<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.600> then

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
two three okay it's a two-step and then

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
two three okay it's a two-step and then
get<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:36.899> leg<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.380> position<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.489> can

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
get your leg out in position and you can

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
get your leg out in position and you can
do<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.940> pretty<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> circular<00:00:39.809> motion

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
do that pretty much in a circular motion

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.990 
do that pretty much in a circular motion
you<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> work<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> stage<00:00:41.280> again<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you have to work the stage again this is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
you have to work the stage again this is
prejudging<00:00:42.629> you're<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.290> showing<00:00:43.410> your

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
prejudging you're just showing your

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.350 
prejudging you're just showing your
physique<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.969> pretty<00:00:45.120> much<00:00:45.210> use

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
physique you can pretty much use

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.389 
physique you can pretty much use
whatever<00:00:45.809> routine<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.410> want<00:00:46.680> okay<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
whatever routine you want okay but you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
whatever routine you want okay but you
may<00:00:47.579> not<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> whole<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> time<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
may not have a whole lot of time as you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.779 
may not have a whole lot of time as you
only<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.920> minute<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> display<00:00:50.640> what

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
only have one minute to display what

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.959 
only have one minute to display what
you've<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.680> I'm<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> show<00:00:53.550> poses

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you've got so I'm going to show poses

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
you've got so I'm going to show poses
from<00:00:54.059> both<00:00:54.300> sides<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.840> show<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.140> symmetry

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
from both sides and show my symmetry

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
from both sides and show my symmetry
okay<00:00:56.640> little<00:00:56.910> variation<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> trice<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> PO

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
okay little variation of a trice the PO

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
okay little variation of a trice the PO
is<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.469> easy<00:00:58.649> transition<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.520> didn't<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is very easy transition I didn't have to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.599 
is very easy transition I didn't have to
move<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.149> whole<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.629> hit<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.899> pose<00:01:01.609> okay

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
move a whole lot to hit that pose okay

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
move a whole lot to hit that pose okay
same<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.390> shown<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> serratus

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
same thing here was shown the serratus

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.560 
same thing here was shown the serratus
and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.280> into<00:01:05.430> abdominal<00:01:06.060> shot<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and then right into abdominal shot and

and then right into abdominal shot and
then<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> course<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.110> natural<00:01:07.439> pose<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.880> most

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
then of course the natural pose the most

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550 
then of course the natural pose the most
muscular<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.689> after<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> always<00:01:10.320> want
