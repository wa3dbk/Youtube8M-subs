museum it's actually my personal stuff I

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.749 
museum it's actually my personal stuff I
bought<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.179> all<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.280> moved<00:00:14.580> into

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
bought it all and we when we moved into

computer and could actually figure out
when<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> drop<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> bombs<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> they

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
when to drop the bombs so that they

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
when to drop the bombs so that they
would<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.120> hit<00:01:03.359> something<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.229> was

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
would actually hit something it was

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.929 
would actually hit something it was
considered<00:01:04.769> such<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> secret<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> world

no<00:01:08.640> talk<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.500> was<00:01:10.520> one<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> great

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
no talk of it was one of the great

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.940 
no talk of it was one of the great
secrets<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.220> its<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.630> IBM<00:01:15.990> 5100

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
secrets of its time this is an IBM 5100

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.090 
secrets of its time this is an IBM 5100
it's<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:18.740> IBM<00:01:19.740> personal

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it's actually the first IBM personal

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.789 
it's actually the first IBM personal
computer<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.030> weighs<00:01:21.299> only<00:01:21.540> 50<00:01:22.080> pounds<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
computer it weighs only 50 pounds so you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.730 
computer it weighs only 50 pounds so you
might<00:01:22.920> consider<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.430> portable<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.470> didn't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
might consider it portable and it didn't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.620 
might consider it portable and it didn't
by<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.310> didn't<00:01:26.549> sell<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:26.790> many<00:01:27.090> but

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
by the way it didn't sell very many but

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
by the way it didn't sell very many but
it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> pioneering<00:01:28.890> effort<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.549> day

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it was a pioneering effort in this day

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
it was a pioneering effort in this day
and<00:01:30.000> they're<00:01:30.119> very<00:01:30.150> rare<00:01:30.570> right<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.320> our

those problems couldn't be done well on
digital<00:02:06.060> computers<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.110> them<00:02:07.259> today

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
digital computers as we know them today

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.040 
digital computers as we know them today
today<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.599> analog

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
today they can be and so analog

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.480 
today they can be and so analog
computers<00:02:10.619> were<00:02:10.800> used

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
computers were used

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.920 
computers were used
and<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.600> thing<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.200> our<00:02:13.350> lobby<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and the thing that's in our lobby is a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.440 
and the thing that's in our lobby is a
an<00:02:15.930> analog<00:02:16.290> computer<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.450> costs

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
an analog computer that was really costs

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570 
an analog computer that was really costs
a<00:02:18.570> lot<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.780> money<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.380> was<00:02:19.620> used<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.190> design

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
a lot of money and was used to design

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.090 
a lot of money and was used to design
things<00:02:20.640> like<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:22.200> rocket<00:02:22.560> ships<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.920> went

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100

to<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.220> moon<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.880> know<00:02:23.970> airplanes<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.630> flew

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350

in<00:02:25.380> those<00:02:25.680> days<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.970> deal<00:02:27.180> every<00:02:27.510> day<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
in those days we deal every day here and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.210 
in those days we deal every day here and
these<00:02:29.460> little<00:02:29.790> chips<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.960> are<00:02:31.020> very<00:02:31.830> small

these little chips that are very small
and<00:02:32.280> how<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.030> 100<00:02:33.390> million<00:02:33.660> transistors

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and how you know 100 million transistors

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.200 
and how you know 100 million transistors
on<00:02:34.500> them<00:02:34.710> it's<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.310> incredible<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.910> they

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
on them it's just incredible that they

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.430 
on them it's just incredible that they
work<00:02:36.390> right<00:02:36.690> well<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:36.960> take<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.380> granted

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
work right well we take it for granted

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.560 
work right well we take it for granted
because<00:02:37.830> that's<00:02:38.070> what<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.370> do<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
because that's what we do and then I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.740 
because that's what we do and then I
look<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> museum<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.340> some<00:02:42.120> for

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
look in the museum and see some for

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.720 
look in the museum and see some for
these<00:02:42.900> World<00:02:43.170> War<00:02:43.410> two<00:02:43.680> computers<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.460> made

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
these World War two computers right made

and three-dimensional cams and things

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
and three-dimensional cams and things
and<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.530> say<00:02:49.710> God<00:02:49.740> how<00:02:50.310> could<00:02:50.460> they<00:02:50.580> ever<00:02:50.610> do

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
and I say God how could they ever do

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.640 
and I say God how could they ever do
that<00:02:51.000> I'm<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.600> sure<00:02:51.660> anyone<00:02:52.050> could<00:02:52.290> reproduce

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that I'm not sure anyone could reproduce

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680 
that I'm not sure anyone could reproduce
those<00:02:53.040> things<00:02:53.340> anymore<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.210> couldn't<00:02:54.510> find

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
those things anymore you couldn't find

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.090 
those things anymore you couldn't find
any<00:02:54.870> way<00:02:55.020> they<00:02:55.140> even<00:02:55.350> know<00:02:55.410> what<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> chip<00:02:55.830> was

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
any way they even know what a chip was

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.890 
any way they even know what a chip was
when<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:56.580> early<00:02:56.850> things<00:02:57.060> were<00:02:57.270> done<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
when these early things were done but

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
when these early things were done but
you<00:02:58.050> had<00:02:58.230> people<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.770> could<00:02:58.950> design<00:02:59.310> things

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
you had people that could design things

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.160 
you had people that could design things
they'd<00:02:59.820> probably<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.300> very<00:03:00.330> hard<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> design

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
they'd probably be very hard to design

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.800 
they'd probably be very hard to design
today<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.400> look<00:03:02.640> at<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.790> insides<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.600> some

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
today if you look at the insides of some
