00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.520
 in different forms to other heitz 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.480
 originates from the occupation in the heating boiler 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.380
 This ash must then be provided by the customer 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.660
 be removed regularly 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.529
 and that was a dusty one so far 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.869
 matter 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.970
 on the other hand, remove this for the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.880
 100% dust-free 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.100
 allow and on the other hand on a to 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.870
 The limit was twice a year 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.149
 Request developed to us at the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.940
 comfort in research becomes the ash 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.699
 by means of a snail from the kessen in 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.370
 promoted an external ashes box and 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.170
 thereby also compacted accordingly and 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.649
 by itself then the emptying 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.859
 interval to one to two times where it's around 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.230
 reduced to empty this box 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.690
 for the customer so comfortable and 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.940
 was as simple as possible 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.110
 the so-called intervening technique 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.970
 designed to remove the box 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.700
 you only need to move the lever 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.550
 which booked and locked around too 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.910
 is closed afterwards this box 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.310
 put on the bags container and 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.250
 The lever will turn into the other one 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.250
 Direction laid around a 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.050
 flap opens and the ash in this 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.750
 underlying container flows 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.890
 This container is with one 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.680
 Compostable plastic says 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.159
 lined up and then the ash 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.030
 just about the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.280
 Dispose of biomuelltonne on compost 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.350
 with this unique and consistent
