00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.180 
ahead and work on the curtains so for
the<00:02:15.690> curtains<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.260> my<00:02:16.380> chopsticks<00:02:16.860> here

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the curtains I have my chopsticks here

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.080 
the curtains I have my chopsticks here
and<00:02:17.670> also<00:02:18.660> thrifted<00:02:19.410> fabric<00:02:20.100> they<00:02:20.760> got<00:02:20.940> this

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and also thrifted fabric they got this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.990 
and also thrifted fabric they got this
for<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:22.650> was<00:02:22.860> three<00:02:23.220> dollars<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.880> was

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
for this was three dollars but it was

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.860 
for this was three dollars but it was
like<00:02:24.239> 50%<00:02:24.750> off<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.380> did<00:02:25.590> beat

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:51.220 

you

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.930 

for<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.349> top<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.769> really<00:02:53.069> wanted<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.519> cover

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
for the top I really wanted it to cover

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.149 
for the top I really wanted it to cover
like<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> thought<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:55.709> be<00:02:55.890> too

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
like this but I thought it would be too

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.699 
like this but I thought it would be too
dark<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.940> can't<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.299> see<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:58.319> inside

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
dark and you can't really see the inside

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.559 
dark and you can't really see the inside
so<00:02:59.250> I'm<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.519> going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.790> go<00:02:59.970> ahead<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.390> glue

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
so I'm just going to go ahead and glue

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.960 
so I'm just going to go ahead and glue
it<00:03:00.810> slanted<00:03:01.739> here<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.609> can<00:03:02.760> cover

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
it slanted here so that we can cover

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330 
it slanted here so that we can cover
every<00:03:03.750> part<00:03:03.959> here<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.260> well<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.890> I'll<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.189> do

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
every part here as well so I'll just do

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
put that aside for now and now we're

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.930 
put that aside for now and now we're
going<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.440> work<00:03:19.739> further<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.459> our

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
going to work further with our

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.569 
going to work further with our
nightstand<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.989> wanted<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.470> make<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.829> tree<00:03:23.310> that

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
nightstand I wanted to make a tree that

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:35.760 
nightstand I wanted to make a tree that
will<00:03:23.819> go<00:03:24.060> around<00:03:24.239> bed<00:03:25.019> so

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770
