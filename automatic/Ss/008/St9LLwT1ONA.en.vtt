favorite way of using the skill move is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.980 
favorite way of using the skill move is
after<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> free-kick<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.000> call<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.689> second

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

great<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> using<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.460> skill<00:01:32.729> move<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.180> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
great way of using this skill move is in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
great way of using this skill move is in
the<00:01:33.630> midfield<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> dribble

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
your opponent and create superiority but

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
your opponent and create superiority but
be<00:01:38.100> careful<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.880> risk<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.360> too<00:01:39.630> much

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
be careful not to risk it too much

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.319 
be careful not to risk it too much
because<00:01:40.079> losing<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> ball<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.549> position

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
because losing the ball in that position

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
because losing the ball in that position
can<00:01:42.689> result<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.560> dangerous

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
can result in some dangerous

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.310 
can result in some dangerous
counter-attacks<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.659> opponent<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
counter-attacks from your opponent of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.249 
counter-attacks from your opponent of
course<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.130> ball<00:01:47.369> flick<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.600> deadly<00:01:48.869> in

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
course the ball flick is also deadly in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
course the ball flick is also deadly in
one-on-ones<00:01:50.070> against<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> defender<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.540> we

with the goalkeeper one more thing that
I've<00:02:04.710> noticed<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.090> skill<00:02:06.329> move<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
I've noticed about this skill move is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.440 
I've noticed about this skill move is
that<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.770> used<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.369> efficiently<00:02:08.879> in

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that it can be used very efficiently in

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.900 
that it can be used very efficiently in
the<00:02:09.509> penalty<00:02:10.020> box<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.920> either<00:02:11.160> dribble<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
the penalty box you either dribble the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.650 
the penalty box you either dribble the
defender<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:13.050> get

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
defender or you get

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.260 
defender or you get
piqué<00:02:14.350> which<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:14.770> most<00:02:15.040> likely<00:02:15.400> result<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.210> a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
piqué which will most likely result in a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.660 
piqué which will most likely result in a
goal<00:02:16.480> I'm<00:02:16.960> not<00:02:17.200> telling<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.560> guys<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.070> use<00:02:18.490> the
