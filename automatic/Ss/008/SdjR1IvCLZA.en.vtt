00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.859
 moreover, with waves came by train to the gate Klose 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.960
 It says there 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.660
 the construction was included 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 that will remain his secret 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.930
 the best way anything but FC Basel 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.020
 he lived Hofbauer workers pending to buy transmitter 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.300
 luckily for Germany 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.790
 that the fire of Admira Wacker MÃ¶dling 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.790
 there were problems with the ball acceptance 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.790
 the victory was deserved 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.390
 Marco the ex-luterer is the way fantastic that both service 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.670
 the game is in front 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.250
 Even off the court acts against Ibertsberger verbal battle 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.190
 Now the national coach wants well on a bench 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.190
 and the Federal Council 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.650
 Philipp Lahm 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
 Basti has and then the band was even before the ball in the 2 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 accompanied there myself 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.860
 but as the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.590
 from the second row but in the next with the second goal 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 these games 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.729
 and that was a very intense job in Winterthur at this election 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.519

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.049
 Oliver Deville 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.240
 he plays no one but Bahrain himself 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.240
 the bus was at Apen make out 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.489
 They did not make the Austrian anyway 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.309
 a second goal 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.309
