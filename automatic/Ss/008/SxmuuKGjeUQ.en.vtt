00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 so i solve it i recanted it and think 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 Today it was time again long 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.210
 walek do i knew with my time 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 nothing to start 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.759
 So I had one again 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 stupid a case 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.770
 which turned out pretty well in the end 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.820
 is and this is about the following us 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 yes the bunnies can see you like that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.010
 usually out of here is another one 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 Model too far from the same manufacturer 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 but no matter which manufacturer 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.140
 You speak here with you always looks 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 like me, they are different 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.140
 visually not very different from each other 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 Although it is always smaller so little things 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 which are different, for example 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.289
 shock absorber wishbone control arm holder 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 et cetera and and so on 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.629
 basic idea the basic concept is always 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 And that's just how they look and me 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 I thought that's a bit too 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 just a bit boring that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.480
 whole 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.470
 and what have i done i have mine 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:10.400
 cinema already just remove the times 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.400
 stretch that looks like the whole 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.220
 before this vehicle had one 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.270
 wheelbase of 32 5 cm and now I am 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 Here at 46 5 cm pigs looks horny 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.540
 So bomb right or what do you say 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.140
 people leave the gem or else 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140
 really cool 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.549
 the whole or not particularly 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.200
 consuming as I said I only have 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.110
 we do not extend the body to us 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.820
 I have to lexan for that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.860
 there are cut from three parts 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.799
 at the gentleman offer for the whole then 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.490
 connected to it with cable ties 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.869
 as a rectangular form , yes 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.490
 and the whole again inside with 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.950
 hot glue connected so that it just 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 stay in shape for the whole here 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.209
 again with cable ties at the front 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.239
 Body of the moored by the mess 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:26.709
 very simple story so i do 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:30.190
 this time you can do it here 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.519
 maybe see better if the focus 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.470
 works so well cable ties and 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.930
 cable ties and a bit of hot glue 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.440
 and already the whole thing is eaten 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.170
 that is slowly happening in the hardware store 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.680
 Employee looks like this 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.500
 have here are another piece is 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.200
 ansich transparency looks like one 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.250
 foil but relatively streaks that 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.250
 whole 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 But it is relatively expensive, I think 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.500
 square meter I have something around the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.579
 But have to pay 15 euros 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 wonderful with a pair of scissors 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.640
 to cut 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.220
 then drill and paint so 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.659
 you can do anything with it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:25.349
 according to you also the result here 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:26.640
 so here is the plate with the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.980
 I extended the whole thing 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.170
 I just have this model for me 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.299
 where the front differential sits 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.849
 just transfer to the plate once 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.549
 here in the back, have a look around here 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.069
 the differential as I said again 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:45.120
 to be able to moor 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.739
 Zack Zack zack so and this is not 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.450
 be about plexiglas people now 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.540
 probably some scold okoro 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.599
 lateral thinker that does not work that way 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.370
 is plexiglas that breaks right here 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.920
 my people this is not a change of glass that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.510
 Here's makrolon looks like 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.340
 plexiglas had the same if I had the same 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.590
 Properties macaroons is namely 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.959
 pretty shockproof and shatterproof it 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.079
 splinters can not be drilled 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.690
 can be threaded 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.519
 the saw cut can be purchased 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.699
 and then bend or it can be 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.049
 even cold because of the egg bank like 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.789
 Here, for example, on this pattern 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.580
 this is also possible 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.409
 eight millimeters thick makrolon how to 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.780
 can see here it is about 90 degrees 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:31.680
 bent and the bending point has become 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.270
 not even discolored so plexiglas 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.460
 It would definitely have been over here 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.610
 but this one is still so stable 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.690
 that I can get up there completely and 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.690
 it holds my whole weight 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:51.639
 that's what I'm doing 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.590
 No thoughts at all that that here 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.780
 break away or something similar it is so 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.470
 actually not possible from the 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.660
 Strength is similar to stone 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.910
 So at the moment the vehicle is still two 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.509
 bd how you can think so if you 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.490
 it is extended the wave here too short 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.169
 but since I do the following I werds in 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.710
 the middle through it and then 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.030
 according to the length I need 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.180
 just in the middle of yet another 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.639
 Weld in and then I have 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.009
 again a wheel in itself a whole 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.300
 simple story 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.820
 the steering the topic provisionally 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.740
 once infected only to that 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.199
 Connect to see whether so hinhaut 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.240
 Does not skin yet that is still too much 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.539
 pale table way too unstable 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.070
 then I would have to reinforce that and 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.110
 before that stand again correctly 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.729
 which is namely all set wrong 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.500
 I do not have the same 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.310
 impact to the left and to the right 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.940
 page 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.409
 that's not the point of the matter though 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:56.979
 otherwise I am here with the result 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:00.699
 almost three hours of free time left 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:04.020
 I must say quite satisfied 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.020
 Looks the whole thing out for you again 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:14.610
 Now look at this length 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:14.610
 that looks so horny from people so horny 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:32.150
 Compared to the other buggy hammer 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:32.150
 real hammer i love this vehicle 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.640
 but here I just see the 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.230
 player is not sitting upside down 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.520
 note 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.960
 I think anyway has no empty 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.070
 No right I can 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.020
 not imagine that such a small one 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.030
 spoiler at 70 km h 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.730
 somehow contact pressure or similar 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.320
 exerts on the rear axle 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.040
 probably only as rollover protection 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.960
 intended for the heat sink here 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.730
 but really pushes indeed does 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.530
 not so it is probably relevant if 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:06.480
 or the other way around 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.450
 so it does not pay attention yes that is 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.100
 actually what I wanted to show 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.540
 looking forward to the test drive, I'm 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.600
 not sure how big the turning radius 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.760
 but fails in the parking lot where we 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.380
 otherwise always have to go 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.990
 actually enough spill and needs 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:26.490
 to be able to apply it 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:28.770
 I'm not thoughts I'm 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.040
 looking forward to your reactions 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:37.440
 that commented is I think so 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:40.100
 Everything just bomb everything then clear 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.100
 Until next time
