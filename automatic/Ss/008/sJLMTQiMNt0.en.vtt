00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.630
 to start I ask the doctor piola 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.630
 which they put together the food doctor 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.829
 that space day more if I say we can kill 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.950
 I've expected from love what this tutea presentation was very good to say 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.000
 that can become contaminated and will walk of the foods by its characteristics 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.210
 they are very easy to be contaminated 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.619
 and that contamination can be multiple, it can be bacterial for its 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.690
 task as it can be is that this entity with toxic substances lorca and 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.149
 we face the toxicologists especially the third afternoon 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.270
 there are some of them are situations like ecotourism which is one of the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 proposals and power the poisoning acclaims in which follows can kill 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.710
 has a very high mortality 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.310
 how it occurs only 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.450
 good botulinum toxin generated by a germ I know it's one of the kitchens 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.180
 more potent than are known from the biological point of view 7 happens that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 that germ 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.740
 It is very resistant to most home methods 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.540
 d sterilization towards so in degree it does not kill 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.230
 maybe a form of resistance that with this gold yes then that's why 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.020
 let's say it's very common 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.609
 between the measures of homemade food would be 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.170
 especially in canned vegetables in our half opening 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 most frequent thing among preserves for example pepper or some for fraud 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 that can not be sterilized at all 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.550
 higher temperature descend 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.620
 ep then there products 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.280
 some that are more polluting than others first conclusion 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.350
 let's say to ee 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.080
 For example we have all the dairy land and in which are 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.299
 food very easily polluting concentrated on not suffering the summer 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.110
 we have in 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.120
 we had now solved quite a problem of the sideways that 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.080
 contaminated with a certain ease by the characteristics of lee does not believe 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.780
 that ice cream is a harmless product and obviously there is a danger that 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.859
 they enclose ice cream parlors 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.730
 certainly a product of the saturated world that you have to take into account not the 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.969
 guardian will consist of ita in lahore
