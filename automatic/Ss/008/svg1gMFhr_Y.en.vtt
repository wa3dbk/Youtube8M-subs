00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.179 
see from my workbench I haven't made
much<00:00:29.160> progress<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.730> remember<00:00:30.450> this<00:00:30.920> film<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
much progress but remember this film and

much progress but remember this film and
this<00:00:32.460> clips<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.199> about<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.320> process<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
this clips is about the process of the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.720 
this clips is about the process of the
project<00:00:35.460> rather<00:00:36.360> than<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.860> progress<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
project rather than the progress of the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.170 
project rather than the progress of the
product<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.140> flutes<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.340> pipes<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:42.030> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
product at the flutes the pipes as you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.110 
product at the flutes the pipes as you
saw<00:00:42.360> last<00:00:42.629> time<00:00:42.750> were<00:00:43.140> made<00:00:43.620> will<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.790> upper

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
saw last time were made will the upper

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.390 
saw last time were made will the upper
lips<00:00:45.300> made<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:47.400> next<00:00:48.920> important<00:00:49.920> job<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
lips made and the next important job to

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.479 
lips made and the next important job to
do<00:00:50.580> is<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.420> me<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.690> Shemp<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:53.280> upper

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
do is for me to Shemp that the upper

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.829 
do is for me to Shemp that the upper
lips<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.790> all<00:00:53.909> the<00:00:54.030> pipe<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.479> I<00:00:54.540> found<00:00:54.750> this

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
lips of all the pipe and I found this

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.770 
lips of all the pipe and I found this
was<00:00:55.049> quite<00:00:55.260> difficult<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.580> do<00:00:56.790> I<00:00:57.089> wear<00:00:57.540> took

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
was quite difficult to to do I wear took

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.780 
was quite difficult to to do I wear took
the<00:00:57.900> pipe<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.769> were<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> nice

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
the pipe they were to get a nice

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.109 
the pipe they were to get a nice
straight<00:01:00.650> shelter<00:01:01.650> across<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.100> top<00:01:02.339> so<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
straight shelter across the top so I

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.939 
straight shelter across the top so I
decided<00:01:03.479> to<00:01:03.659> do<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.930> using<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.350> electric

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
decided to do this using my electric

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
decided to do this using my electric
sander<00:01:05.240> but<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> pipes<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.710> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
sander but I want all the pipes to have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.600 
sander but I want all the pipes to have
a<00:01:07.860> nice<00:01:08.159> even<00:01:09.060> straight<00:01:09.450> line<00:01:10.049> chamfer<00:01:10.680> across

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a nice even straight line chamfer across

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
a nice even straight line chamfer across
the<00:01:13.070> top<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> upper<00:01:15.560> lip<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.400> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the top of the upper lip that's how I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
the top of the upper lip that's how I
decided<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.970> needed<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.900> something<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> my

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
decided I needed to do something to my

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
decided I needed to do something to my
son<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.190> what<00:01:20.310> I've<00:01:20.490> done<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.730> I've<00:01:20.910> encased

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
son as so what I've done is I've encased

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.160 
son as so what I've done is I've encased
it<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.500> rather<00:01:23.130> rickety<00:01:23.700> wooden

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
it in this rather rickety wooden

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.600 
it in this rather rickety wooden
structure<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> made<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.410> wooden<00:01:25.680> box<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
structure I made a wooden box for the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.790 
structure I made a wooden box for the
sand<00:01:26.910> at<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.150> belt<00:01:27.390> sander<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.230> sits<00:01:28.560> in

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
sand at the belt sander just to sits in

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.120 
sand at the belt sander just to sits in
and<00:01:29.190> then<00:01:30.000> I've<00:01:30.150> made<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.750> Ledge<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.140> which

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then I've made a a Ledge here which

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.290 
and then I've made a a Ledge here which
has<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> shelf<00:01:33.270> bonus<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.110> eight<00:01:35.090> roughly<00:01:36.090> eight

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
has a shelf bonus of eight roughly eight

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.360 
has a shelf bonus of eight roughly eight
of<00:01:36.510> degrees<00:01:37.250> which<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:40.560> reading<00:01:40.920> has<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.220> only

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
of degrees which my reading has to only

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.450 
of degrees which my reading has to only
should<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:43.040> slope<00:01:44.040> for<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
should be about the right slope for the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.720 
should be about the right slope for the
upper<00:01:45.360> lip<00:01:45.570> chamfer<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> turn

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
upper lip chamfer and then when I turn

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.860 
upper lip chamfer and then when I turn
on<00:01:47.760> my<00:01:48.000> son<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:49.260> just<00:01:49.470> slide<00:01:50.400> down<00:01:50.510> up<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.690> lip

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
on my son I can just slide down up a lip

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.130 
on my son I can just slide down up a lip
certain<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.920> nicely<00:01:53.450> slide<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:54.810> side<00:01:55.080> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
certain it nicely slide it from side to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.880 
certain it nicely slide it from side to
side<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.980> that<00:01:56.580> should<00:01:56.610> give<00:01:56.909> me<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.240> nice

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
side and that should give me a nice

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.649 
side and that should give me a nice
straight<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.310> don't<00:01:59.970> know<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.330> see<00:02:00.510> that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
straight I don't know you can see that

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.530 
straight I don't know you can see that

I've been doing I've made a French style

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.300 
I've been doing I've made a French style
flute<00:02:18.030> living<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.810> France<00:02:19.110> my<00:02:19.950> friend<00:02:20.190> should

make their flutes differently they make

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.360 
make their flutes differently they make
some<00:02:22.800> wonderful<00:02:23.959> mechanical<00:02:24.959> organs

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
some wonderful mechanical organs

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.430 
some wonderful mechanical organs
this<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> French<00:02:27.420> tile<00:02:27.690> fleet<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.319> an

you over you can test the flute by

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.030 
you over you can test the flute by
putting<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.269> block<00:03:06.480> on<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.799> can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
putting the block on it and you can

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.390 
putting the block on it and you can
widen<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.700> Lumiere<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.569> if<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.500> make<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.190> too

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
widen the Lumiere and if you make it too

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.680 
widen the Lumiere and if you make it too
big<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> find<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.239> quality<00:03:12.659> of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
big and you find that your quality of

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.229 
big and you find that your quality of
sound<00:03:13.650> reduces<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.579> can<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.849> sand<00:03:15.060> down

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
sound reduces and you can just sand down

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.240 
sound reduces and you can just sand down
the<00:03:15.420> whole<00:03:15.599> block<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.349> then<00:03:16.709> start<00:03:17.069> you're

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the whole block and then start you're

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.130 
the whole block and then start you're
making<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.640> room<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:18.030> don't<00:03:18.870> know<00:03:19.019> might

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
making you room you don't know might

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.160 
making you room you don't know might
possibly<00:03:19.489> look<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.510> base<00:03:21.659> of<00:03:21.690> my<00:03:21.930> flute

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
possibly look on the base of my flute

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.270 
possibly look on the base of my flute
this<00:03:22.379> is<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.709> made<00:03:22.920> from<00:03:23.480> pine<00:03:27.799> bough<00:03:28.799> rocks

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
this is just made from pine bough rocks

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.800 
this is just made from pine bough rocks
so<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.090> fruit<00:03:30.239> I'm<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:30.510> gonna<00:03:30.660> blow

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
so that's the fruit I'm just gonna blow

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.420 
so that's the fruit I'm just gonna blow
in<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.959> hole<00:03:31.139> listen<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:37.099> put<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.220> block

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
in the hole listen I put the block

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.390 
in the hole listen I put the block
nicely<00:03:38.970> lined<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.799> think<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:40.919> about<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
nicely lined up I think it's about the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.369 
nicely lined up I think it's about the
best<00:03:41.730> safety<00:03:42.049> token<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.370> that's<00:03:47.609> an<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:48.030> at<00:03:48.720> 440

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
best safety token and that's an a at 440

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.979 
best safety token and that's an a at 440
Hertz<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.549> other<00:03:50.940> than<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.299> found<00:03:51.690> a

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
Hertz so other than that I found a

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.289 
Hertz so other than that I found a
woodworking<00:03:52.470> shop<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.889> Paris<00:03:53.430> where<00:03:54.180> they

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
woodworking shop in Paris where they

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.229 
woodworking shop in Paris where they
would<00:03:54.419> work<00:03:54.629> throws<00:03:55.410> away<00:03:55.819> masses<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:56.940> scraps

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
would work throws away masses of scraps

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.289 
would work throws away masses of scraps
of<00:03:57.510> wood<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.919> welcomes<00:03:59.400> any<00:03:59.579> other<00:03:59.790> once<00:03:59.940> you

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
of wood and welcomes any other once you

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.460 
of wood and welcomes any other once you
down<00:04:00.720> his<00:04:00.900> dustbin

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
down his dustbin

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.849 
down his dustbin
so<00:04:01.980> my<00:04:02.519> sanding<00:04:03.269> block<00:04:03.449> is<00:04:03.599> made<00:04:03.810> from<00:04:04.049> scraps

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
so my sanding block is made from scraps

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.409 
so my sanding block is made from scraps
of<00:04:05.010> wood<00:04:05.069> recuperated<00:04:05.910> from<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.150> local

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
of wood recuperated from the local

of wood recuperated from the local
workers<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.139> been<00:04:07.400> if<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.639> find<00:04:09.000> leather

product<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:58.980> is<00:04:59.040> animal<00:04:59.670> glue<00:04:59.880> it<00:05:00.390> has<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.720> be

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
product this is animal glue it has to be

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.770 
product this is animal glue it has to be
diluted<00:05:01.320> with<00:05:01.350> their<00:05:01.800> water<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:03.090> boiled<00:05:03.960> for

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
diluted with their water and boiled for

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.990 
diluted with their water and boiled for
simmered<00:05:06.780> for<00:05:06.810> 20<00:05:07.290> minutes<00:05:07.590> or<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.580> it'll

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
simmered for 20 minutes or so and it'll

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.540 
simmered for 20 minutes or so and it'll
make<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.510> liquid<00:05:09.720> glue<00:05:10.020> but<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.040> advantage<00:05:11.460> of

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
make a liquid glue but the advantage of

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.810 
make a liquid glue but the advantage of
it<00:05:11.700> is<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.540> as<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.810> stays<00:05:13.020> liquid<00:05:13.670> when<00:05:14.670> it's

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
it is that as it stays liquid when it's

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.910 
it is that as it stays liquid when it's
warm<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:15.450> very<00:05:15.600> easy<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.900> work<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.710> can<00:05:16.800> put

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
warm it's very easy to work you can put

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.250 
warm it's very easy to work you can put
it<00:05:17.040> on<00:05:17.130> quite<00:05:17.400> thinly<00:05:17.880> as<00:05:18.300> soon<00:05:18.720> as<00:05:18.840> it's<00:05:18.990> cold

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
it on quite thinly as soon as it's cold

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.770 
it on quite thinly as soon as it's cold
the<00:05:19.440> glue<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.800> dry<00:05:20.190> moving<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.330> reglue<00:05:21.510> you

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
the glue is dry moving it to reglue you

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.870 
the glue is dry moving it to reglue you
just<00:05:21.990> run<00:05:22.200> an<00:05:22.350> iron<00:05:22.620> over<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.850> can

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
just run an iron over it and you can

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.850 
just run an iron over it and you can
peel<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.210> off<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:24.840> reglue<00:05:25.230> so<00:05:25.500> that's<00:05:25.680> as<00:05:25.770> long

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
peel it off and reglue so that's as long

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.340 
peel it off and reglue so that's as long
as<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.070> used<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.340> glue<00:05:26.640> my<00:05:26.670> leather<00:05:27.420> to<00:05:28.320> the
