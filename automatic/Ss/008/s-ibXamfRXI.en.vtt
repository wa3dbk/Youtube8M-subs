00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
tough and pretty unpredictable but with

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.910 
tough and pretty unpredictable but with
parallel<00:00:53.579> kinda<00:00:53.840> situation

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.040 

well<00:00:59.920> definitely<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.910> elements<00:01:01.480> in<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.780> city

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.630 
well definitely the elements in the city
are<00:01:02.320> not<00:01:02.559> quite<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.949> same<00:01:03.129> as<00:01:03.190> on<00:01:03.550> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
are not quite the same as on the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.070 
are not quite the same as on the
mountain<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.210> we're<00:01:04.750> skiing<00:01:04.989> on

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080

scaffolding<00:01:05.650> instead<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.729> natural<00:01:06.940> hill

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
scaffolding instead of the natural hill

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.230 
scaffolding instead of the natural hill
and<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.830> means<00:01:09.009> it's<00:01:09.340> going<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.549> be<00:01:09.700> shorter

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
and it means it's going to be shorter

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.050 
and it means it's going to be shorter
and<00:01:10.570> deeper<00:01:11.530> at<00:01:11.710> times

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
and deeper at times

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.050

you<00:01:16.420> just<00:01:16.750> have<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.049> go<00:01:17.170> as<00:01:17.259> hard<00:01:17.380> as<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.590> can

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
you just have to go as hard as you can

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:37.740
