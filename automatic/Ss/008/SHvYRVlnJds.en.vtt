 Compressor failure trousers 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.120
 moisture 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.500
 the presence of non-compensable cassis in units of the system produce effects 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.289
 damage to its components 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.140
 the non-compensating charges raise the pressure and the discharge temperature 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.960
 impairing product performance 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.519
 moisture can affect the system in two ways 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.250
 freezing is an expansion device helps to increase the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.200
 restricting the refrigerant gas or even blocking its flow there 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.120
 when reacting with lubricating oil and with the refrigerant 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.219
 it is reported that those that cause metallic confusion 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.140
 and deterioration of the insulation of the motorcycle road the kompressor can lead to burning 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.340
 component 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.760
 for these reasons, humidity must be eliminated and we must use 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.020
 a high-performance vacuum pump 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.080
 connected to the system 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.020
 return of liquid 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.610
 it can usually be said that the return of coolant in the liquid phase 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.900
 for the kompressor will occur whenever the system is charged with gas 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.000
 refrigerant or when the expansion 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.620
 not selected correctly 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.560
 for systems using forced confection with evaporator 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.759
 liquid return may occur if the airflow through the evaporator is 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.759
 restricted 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.250
 contamination 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 among contaminants that can lead to a failure of the kompressor issue 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 cassez non-compensable metal chips and other types of dirt 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 that can enter the system during its installation 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.270
 these pollutants 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.049
 create higher than normal condensation conditions by overloading the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.210
 valves and causing the bearing surfaces to wear out. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.660
 prematurely 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.859
 additionally 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.379
 formation of coal around the 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.080
 valves 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.289
 and in the segment area 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:17.219
 are other contaminants that can block 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.869
 small holes and caused constraints in both the flow of 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:27.009
 coolant inside the system as the oil flow through the kompressor 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.569
 In addition, the metal chips can cause the kompressor 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.839
 or that the valves do not feel 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.109
 overheating 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.749
 there are several sources of heat in the cooling system including heat 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:48.359
 generated by the compression of the gas friction of the bearings and the bovine of the motors 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.599
 the compressor designed to operate correctly 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.120
 with these normal thermal gains 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.569
 if the coil temperatures of the edu promoter or read with price up to this 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.720
 recommended limits, the kompressor will fail prematurely. 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.760
 the furnished promoter of the kompressor 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.510
 are designed for continuous operation 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.839
 the maximum temperature of 130 degrees Celsius 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.580
 the recommended maximum discharge temperature for 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.880
 Sweet tears from Brazil 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.990
 and 120 degrees centigrade if this limit is exceeded the correct man of the faults 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.670
 suction and discharge can degrade 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.159
 causing the valves to fail 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.609
 additionally the couple formed in this process 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.179
 will contaminate the system 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.180
 lifted the expansion device lock 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180
 and the kompressor lubrication system 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.219
 electrical problems 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.729
 the electrical components that can accompany the kompressor are 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.739
 in it the starting thermal protector 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.169
 capacitors starting haiti gear 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.659
 these components functioned properly within their 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.299
 temperature and board 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.829
 If you pass the parameters, the components will fail and can lead to 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.049
 road bike burning 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.699
 it is important to remember that only 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:17.739
 the electrical components specified by the product engineering hereunder. 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.859
 brazil shirt 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.900
 power intentions outside the kompressor operating range as well. 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.650
 have caused overheating and may cause the capacitors to fail. 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.819
 jellies resulting in very rapid cycling of the motorcycle protector 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:35.849
 thermal 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.819
 improper eye return 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.569
 the return of an eye can be a problem in the systems with the Indian and the prosecutor 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.460
 that the condenser are separated by long pipes 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.830
 this situation 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.600
 can have two damaging consequences on the compressor 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.680
 return of an eye at an inappropriate speed or 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.220
 system
