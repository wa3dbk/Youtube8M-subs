00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.130
 Halli hello and welcome 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.470
 youtube i am outraged you right 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.840
 welcome to a new video, yes and 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.550
 today for you black ops 2 like quick 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.860
 I then step right this is one 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.870
 quick stop tutorial all this nato 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.000
 in a little private match with the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.449
 love good bots that insert in the game 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.970
 can 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.769
 and important to say yes that we are 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.680
 first here together the animation 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.690
 look how it looks like here 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 how is the animation of the weapon we are 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.909
 look at this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:02.110
 here shows sixx coop we see that here 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:04.659
 that the animation is different than mw2 and 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.330
 mp3s goes slowly into the gate and then 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.000
 fast slow fast slow fast 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.290
 and then it's gonna be that tough 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
 WaffentrÃ¤ger but then is pretty 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 Quick to the coop and the question is now 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.540
 what is a war swap came in mw3 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.490
 many ask you why why 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.840
 that yes, the battle scope because I here 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 the weapon is not what you are here now 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.170
 Look is out of the cinema I have to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.090
 made extra so you just see 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.130
 what it looks like for you in game though 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.380
 you somebody snip you see 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.909
 that someone in innsbruck is going as well 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.120
 now here i am going to become natural 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.330
 First of all I will of course also one 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.520
 Install some clips as they are right for 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.680
 you look like I 'm doing a few now 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.780
 clicks cops and for you in the cinema mode 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.979
 and if you are now in spectator in 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.350
 his stonemason is looking for his 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.570
 For example, you would only be here like this 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.960
 a bit of what I see black 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.880
 However, what is important here is the look 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.740
 crosshairs flash so when I enter 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.659
 copies is quite minimal, the crosshair 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 blinking that says I'll ever do that 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.590
 to the door 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 and I'll just check it out 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.759
 few bots i say push headshot see 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.490
 flash the crosshairs for a moment and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.030
 then I'll drop you off now 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.550
 on 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.440
 from a live record that looks like 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.270
 and how the war does not rage from the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.660
 cinema mode be so looks much fun 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.660
 in order to 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.190
 Here we see that rationally and accurately 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.450
 that's what it should look like 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.800
 it is important if you now know how 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.350
 war head works 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.690
 So I have to go to Innsbruck with the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.630
 right mouse button see my crosshair 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.550
 press off and go back out of the scope 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.010
 out so I go from the head bridge 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.780
 and the excavated out just more 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.489
 this whole thing does not go jagged 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.140
 scope the outside scope and out again 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.360
 Do not be surprised if I'm so fast 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.630
 fall over 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.739
 the whole looks like that to salad 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.330
 I here the health and the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.340
 half asked so we see once 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.730
 very short four-stroke I give my 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.670
 mobile 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.090
 Here you can practice nice you should too 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.310
 to meet 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.080
 So you see the reticule very briefly 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.190
 and expresses and that is for each of 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.720
 you can do it now is the question 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.130
 of course, as usual, that's reasonable yes 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.769
 I see a lot of pots here you can 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.450
 set the private match offer her 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.709
 Of course you can also talk with your friends 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.900
 play the practice 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.060
 It is important that always remember 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.299
 have to be like football 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.340
 a pass in the run and the same is 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.170
 here so if the opponent is running I have to 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.640
 calculate approximately when I go into 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.590
 Copies was not the crosshairs see where 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.340
 the opponent is then and only then can 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.560
 I push off 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 that means when corner can come 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.489
 I'm not okay you the opponent from here so 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.080
 I can not go here in Innsbruck 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.930
 because, on the other hand, as likely during 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.340
 I'm here the way 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.780
 the enemy is already in the cockpit here 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.819
 So maybe I have to because he's right 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.709
 to as her and just go into a 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.540
 There are private matches with friends in 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.269
 a private match fix arrives here 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.159
 little bit looking for you the player moves 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.099
 People simply look to you here 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.659
 the box is still low at first 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.969
 low skill and then you are looking for it 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.879
 you and fixed costs you are looking for 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.530
 maybe first what is there after 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.719
 there is a recruit there that is the lowest 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.430
 Try it first as a recruit and afterwards 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.889
 maybe as veterans or stop 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.419
 mercenary 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.340
 yes and then you give it this way 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.650
 I 'm doing this and then you have 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.150
 At some point a few war course applies the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.320
 I have to give you a perfect class now 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.680
 do not explain there is another 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.800
 tutorial on the channel so you have to 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.630
 Do not worry about it now 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.060
 what is the perfect class that 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.410
 you will still be told on a canal 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.160
 I'll get there too 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.099
 to make video 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.630
 beauty of the wrap if you still have me 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.990
 can not subscribe you can me 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.570
 of course subscribe so that you can learn 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.070
 how it is really so what is the best 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.460
 class is of course a video too 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.490
 and vice versa, there is in one 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.990
 private match it could still drive 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.250
 the air must stop 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.330
 the air does not stop 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.250
 Of course you can stop the air 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.750
 because if I can fix group here 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.250
 be that they have not quite on it and 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.590
 maybe another shot art 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.840
 applying 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.570
 maybe a resin coop because of that 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.530
 I always recommend you cool immediately 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.650
 to stop air 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.970
 here in black ops 2 see how it is 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.699
 actually pretty middle of it all 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.479
 crosshair here what us of course 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.120
 huge advantage 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.530
 So he's always bringing it 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.690
 where to go scope there is the middle there 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.639
 Can you meet opponents like it 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.970
 In football, a pass in the running practices that 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.800
 here 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.240
 you only go in sceaux stops 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.120
 while decided that's right too 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.949
 important 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.169
 So not here here should hurt 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.300
 press and here is political on the other hand 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.340
 the he did not so do not meet 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.020
 I can press something here 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.790
 do not meet when I like to press and 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.630
 while running the shots that go 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.900
 everywhere 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.740
 it does not work, it does not work either 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.360
 kind of that one half a second in 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.639
 sceaux stay then is really that way 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.169
 when you in cinematic mode the crosshairs 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.000
 you can not see anymore during the 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.160
 playing crosshairs flashed briefly 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.020
 they can bring away all this well 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.800
 simply that is war schopen remains 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.720
 stand 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.479
 hold the air through it hurts you 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.220
 not and really exists with friends 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.139
 In the private match then someday could 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.520
 it really gets kicked by public 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.960
 me also a few factory directors 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.250
 give tutorial for all those now 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.449
 know how to properly war future 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.760
 but still do not know how 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:28.240
 there is also a public scope 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.310
 tutorial that you now directly you 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.620
 Let's get out there in private match with it 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.060
 the animation gets the pass skills 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.740
 It's a little different. It's one 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.330
 little different than other call of 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.740
 Duty parts and I hope, of course 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.600
 I always tell you in this video 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.849
 could help and please forget that 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.919
 rate comments and of course 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.080
 do not write your questions in the 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.439
 comments or your note 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.439
