 we can start that again 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.230
 before starting the Greeks where to 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.539
 try to have some requirements or 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.390
 a single garage that is in a 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.990
 apartment or ok anyway only 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.360
 a garage, however, that is 10 seats in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.549
 all eight places will have to be there 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.619
 your car insured in a ditch 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.570
 be a car you took before for 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.520
 street a little I hope to be free 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.110
 also always in the same direction to be 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 a vehicle you want to publish in 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.670
 this vehicle, however, the punt that will drink 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.200
 like 200,000 something like that though 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.340
 do not worry you can do this that you can 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.140
 do with all the machine you can 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 also publish the aid for boys 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 he published gave me a million 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 and half then really an act instead 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.530
 it's nothing once I've seen that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 try to have these requirements take 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.560
 the car in question that you want to apply 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 and head out of the garage 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.820
 once you have arrived you are 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.880
 you just need to get out of the garage 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.620
 destroy the car he is doing 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.270
 let's say a kind of ten for non 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.950
 pay the insurance but you can stay 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.870
 quietly you can destroy it in 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.610
 any way the beach will work it 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.890
 I myself advise you to destroy 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.140
 will destroy in the other way for that 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.690
 you will do much sooner and nothing once 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.580
 that you destroyed the car in the street 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.240
 however take the car of a civilian or 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.240
 a parked car 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.300
 once the car in question is taken 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.880
 you head in front of the gate of the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.150
 garage where you want to duplicate 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.819
 the car I repeat in this this who 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.770
 is using from as much as in that while 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.590
 I'll call you in front of the garages 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.850
 insurance as it was they sell in 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.080
 video you position yourself in front of the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.620
 sluice of your garage with 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.660
 insurance open without we say 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.970
 select the car then go to the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.020
 sluice and a moment before 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.819
 crashing into the gate 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.010
 select from insurance if it will make you 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.260
 enter the garage for animation 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.790
 say that it will have worked once that 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.730
 you entered the garage with the car 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.800
 lose on the way out and you will see that at 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.410
 deposit to bites mutual there will be precisely 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.489
 the much that you have taken back we say first 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.160
 with insurance 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.080
 you go quietly learn e 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.080
 return to your true one 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 once you are back at yours 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.710
 garage 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.570
 you simply have to take e 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.700
 replace it covered but with one of the two 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.050
 vehicles that you took on the road one 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.180
 once replaced 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.800
 take the other vehicle you took 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.570
 this the remaining one exits it 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.550
 destroy revenue in the garage and 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.860
 in fact he would have avoided cars and cars 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.630
 you can easily make others 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.370
 guys there's the 45-minute bypass 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.660
 so you can sell to the car 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.400
 endlessly 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.500
 I think it's a really good truck 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.610
 I wanted to ask for 150 live for this 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.740
 clinical kids because really 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.530
 fantastic I also share with everyone 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.970
 with our friends, anyone you know 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.630
 my for but the charismatic heat of everything 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.630
 beautiful 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.560
 all 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.120
