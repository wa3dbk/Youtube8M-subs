00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.810
 mosaic cut glass lines made in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.210

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 liquid below here or else instead 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 to use the mosaic grout is to leave 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.719
 transparency for this whole 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.850

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.000
 I loved that it is the strong cool effect 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.760
 individual people can take advantage of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.490
 times until it's 11 and if we're going to do it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.450
 this and if this is really a glass 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.500

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.900
 Beautiful visual I'm using 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.509
 My glass is actually not 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.299

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.060
 they have more or less the same the same 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.220
 way of working that uranus is not that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.490
 that is they they give a very effect 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.500
 Although the same florets you think 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.890

 low because not to run the risk of 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.879
 then pass and it is preferable to miss a 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.970
 slightly below 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.860
 This one looks at seeing off with 11 but the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.299
 piece is full if you start to 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.510
 down and runs the risk of 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.920
 Overcome the very super super foul
