00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
clumping part of that is because it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
clumping part of that is because it's
not<00:01:05.549> too<00:01:05.939> dramatic<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> volumizing<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.740> do

like this Bhaskar does a really good job
at<00:02:19.519> lengthening<00:02:20.590> my<00:02:21.590> lashes<00:02:21.829> and<00:02:22.430> adding

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
at lengthening my lashes and adding

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.890 
at lengthening my lashes and adding
volume<00:02:24.040> which<00:02:25.040> that's<00:02:25.760> what<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.150> costs<00:02:26.510> itself

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
volume which that's what it costs itself

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.990 
volume which that's what it costs itself
is<00:02:27.019> lengthening<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.680> volumizing<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:28.459> think<00:02:28.909> it

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
is lengthening and volumizing I think it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.789 
is lengthening and volumizing I think it
has<00:02:29.090> an<00:02:29.209> excellent<00:02:29.659> job<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.319> is<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
has an excellent job this is one of the

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.140 
has an excellent job this is one of the
first<00:02:30.920> mascaras<00:02:31.609> that<00:02:31.639> I<00:02:31.909> used<00:02:32.359> and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:34.459> think

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
first mascaras that I used and I think

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.580 
first mascaras that I used and I think
it<00:02:35.239> gives<00:02:35.389> an<00:02:35.689> excellent<00:02:35.989> effect<00:02:36.349> especially

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it gives an excellent effect especially

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.530 
it gives an excellent effect especially
for<00:02:37.069> a<00:02:37.099> beginner<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> that's<00:02:41.209> what<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.389> looks

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
for a beginner so that's what it looks

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.729 
for a beginner so that's what it looks
like<00:02:42.489> with<00:02:43.489> mascara<00:02:44.000> without<00:02:44.659> again<00:02:45.409> just<00:02:45.620> on

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
like with mascara without again just on

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.460 
like with mascara without again just on
the<00:02:45.859> top<00:02:46.040> lashes<00:02:46.659> so<00:02:47.659> I<00:02:47.689> mean<00:02:48.079> it's<00:02:48.230> definitely

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
the top lashes so I mean it's definitely

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.250 
the top lashes so I mean it's definitely
noticeable<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:50.239> it<00:02:50.359> being<00:02:50.540> black<00:02:50.780> Brown<00:02:51.049> I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
noticeable with it being black Brown I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.459 
noticeable with it being black Brown I
feel<00:02:51.439> like<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:53.109> chose<00:02:54.109> that<00:02:54.260> color

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
feel like it's I chose that color

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.289 
feel like it's I chose that color
because<00:02:54.829> it<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.069> less<00:02:55.280> intimidating<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.150> me

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
because it was less intimidating to me

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.509 
because it was less intimidating to me
but<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.109> don't<00:02:57.319> feel<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:57.859> like<00:02:58.219> any

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
but I don't feel like it's like any

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.479 
but I don't feel like it's like any
lighter<00:02:59.079> than<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:00.109> black<00:03:00.409> mascara<00:03:01.040> if<00:03:01.340> that

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
lighter than a black mascara if that

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.449 
lighter than a black mascara if that
makes<00:03:01.669> sense<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:03.139> don't<00:03:03.769> see<00:03:04.189> any

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
makes sense and I don't see any

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.030 
makes sense and I don't see any
noticeable<00:03:04.700> clumping<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.959> think<00:03:06.739> they<00:03:06.829> look

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
pretty and then they are enhanced but

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.550 
pretty and then they are enhanced but

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
you can't rip it off ruin most of the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.130 
you can't rip it off ruin most of the
time<00:04:03.150> when<00:04:03.269> he<00:04:03.420> interrupts<00:04:03.810> sort<00:04:04.050> of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
time when he interrupts sort of

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.660 
time when he interrupts sort of
recording<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.739> go<00:04:04.890> ahead<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.070> record<00:04:05.430> again

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.540 
but because this is mascara that will
not<00:04:09.330> be<00:04:09.569> happening<00:04:13.100> okay<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.160> there's<00:04:14.459> that

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.210 

when<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.630> use<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:22.079> mascara<00:04:22.560> it's<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.100> is

when I use this mascara it's it is

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.650 
when I use this mascara it's it is
because<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.610> want<00:04:23.940> kind<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.479> natural

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.260 
because I want kind of a more natural
look<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.860> don't<00:04:26.250> ever<00:04:26.400> go<00:04:26.580> back<00:04:26.760> in<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.120> do<00:04:27.240> a

look so I don't ever go back in and do a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.810 
look so I don't ever go back in and do a
second<00:04:27.720> coat<00:04:27.900> but<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.680> don't<00:04:29.370> feel<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.550> it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
second coat but I don't feel like it

second coat but I don't feel like it
would<00:04:29.940> clump<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.330> will<00:04:30.570> try<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
would clump I will try that in just a

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.570 
would clump I will try that in just a
second<00:04:31.500> after<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.770> feel<00:04:31.950> like<00:04:32.040> I've<00:04:32.160> given<00:04:32.310> it

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
second after I feel like I've given it

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.240 
second after I feel like I've given it
sufficient<00:04:33.300> time<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.720> dry<00:04:33.930> but<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:34.979> is<00:04:35.100> what

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
sufficient time to dry but this is what

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.740 
sufficient time to dry but this is what
it<00:04:35.340> looks<00:04:35.520> like<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.910> can<00:04:36.060> tell<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.419> they<00:04:36.570> are

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
it looks like you can tell that they are

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.170 
it looks like you can tell that they are
much<00:04:36.990> more<00:04:37.320> noticeable<00:04:38.010> now<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:38.940> have

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
much more noticeable now that I have

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.700 
much more noticeable now that I have
that<00:04:39.360> must<00:04:39.600> hear<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:42.350> okay<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:43.410> I'm<00:04:43.530> going<00:04:43.620> to

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
that must hear on okay so I'm going to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.800 
that must hear on okay so I'm going to
go<00:04:43.770> back<00:04:43.890> on<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.070> side<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.400> first<00:04:44.970> side<00:04:45.510> and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
go back on that side that first side and

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
go back on that side that first side and
put<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> second<00:04:46.470> coat<00:04:51.500> again<00:04:52.500> this<00:04:52.650> isn't

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
put a second coat again this isn't

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.500 
put a second coat again this isn't
something<00:04:52.979> that<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:53.340> would<00:04:53.430> normally<00:04:53.789> do<00:04:54.210> but<00:04:54.450> I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
something that I would normally do but I

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.890 
something that I would normally do but I
am<00:04:54.600> doing<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.080> for<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.350> benefit<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.130> video

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
am doing it for the benefit of the video

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:05.340 
am doing it for the benefit of the video
for<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.080> guys

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.100 

okay<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:06.190> that's<00:05:06.430> with<00:05:06.670> two<00:05:07.030> coats<00:05:07.360> well<00:05:07.750> it

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
okay so that's with two coats well it

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.900 
okay so that's with two coats well it
definitely<00:05:08.860> made<00:05:09.100> a<00:05:09.130> difference<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.790> the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
definitely made a difference of the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.600 
definitely made a difference of the
length<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.900> my<00:05:11.110> lashes<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.650> was<00:05:11.800> not<00:05:11.980> expecting

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
length of my lashes I was not expecting

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:27.450 
length of my lashes I was not expecting
that

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.620 

okay<00:05:28.300> so<00:05:28.360> that's<00:05:28.750> two<00:05:29.230> coats<00:05:29.950> on<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:31.420> top

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
okay so that's two coats on the top

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.300 
okay so that's two coats on the top
lashes<00:05:31.900> one<00:05:32.290> coat<00:05:32.560> on<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.800> bottom

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
lashes one coat on the bottom

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.890 
lashes one coat on the bottom
I<00:05:33.340> feel<00:05:33.790> like<00:05:33.880> this<00:05:34.000> gives<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.390> really<00:05:34.630> pretty

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780
