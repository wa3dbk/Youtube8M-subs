00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.750
 39 are going to meet 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.400
 free kick for Quilmes say goodbye to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.720
 all get into this ball stopped that 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.460
 has the set of pablo quatrocchi 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.849
 fernando crucial takes the face still 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.849
 he has not walked 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 comes from an ankle science 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.920
 left product of a lack of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.619
 zárate match against pain is in the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.020
 same place now yes sir of hurts 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 enough to take position to the area with 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.740
 much difficulty is slowed down in the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.150
 crescent these are the ones that center the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 backs of the men who are going to cover 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.940
 to caranta it hurts a lot to cross with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.390
 time to beat him together with gonzález 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.390
 gonzález 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.470
 do not 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.110
 the queues or quilmes arnaldo gonzález 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.900
 to the left stick of caranta permission 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.110
 said and is the first of quilmes the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.730
 first after so many minutes 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.970
 the tournament starts winning quilmes 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.370
 in front of central gonzález he did 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.350
 treading the 40 the gusts are to be 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.350
 sweeps I said at some point for 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.870
 break it you break quilmes 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.700
 grown up he had anticipated that 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.500
 had another intention about the end of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.140
 first time this is a great kicker 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.290
 to his credit he treasures a great goal 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.759
 example to san lorenzo de almagro also 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.080
 from a good expensive distance but it's 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.040
 here is the chance of the team of 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.530
 4g how much thread did he give, not sterile 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.960
 transforms the auction gonzález la 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.229
 stretched of caranta it deserved to quilmes 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.670
 he deserved it because he had been encouraged 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.800
 because he had gone ahead because he 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.479
 had stolen control in half of 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.890
 the russo team's court and what 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.470
 finds in this way wins the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.119
 brewer in surprise the giant of 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.490
 arroyito 10 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.049
 the teacher's orders are moved in easy 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.590
 have two easy I think central 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.570
 should slow down a little bit further 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.330
 of the domain that he was holding about 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 his adversary medina which is for me 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.380
 the attention arrives martínez backwards 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.380
 for benítez and he crazy benítez 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.590
 the knicks and the 3 in the back and more 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.180
 I think I went to fight and more 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.790
 big guy keeps the signs of 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.810
 skill that the crazy abreu one by one 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.430
 between that expensive 13 and 35 because I had to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.680
 decelerate central because it was 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.270
 doing and 100 saying and did not find 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.700
 hollows I could not find spaces 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.400
 I found clarity look at what paradox 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.280
 of fate the youngest in the fight 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.810
 from above and the highest defines it from 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.989
 down 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.810
 for that is abreu to pivot for 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.150
 hold to attend and not to forgive 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.069
 if you give him a ball like this was 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.489
 very high the risk that kirchner ran 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.860
 it was difficult to defend the result only 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.900
 with a defensive stop without having the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.420
 ball and handing over the entire field to 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.370
 adversary the party is now just in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:23.370
 As for result 11, there is history 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.370
 here in the giant that the wedge benitez 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.950
 but it is an isolated play of the 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.810
 last five minutes stopped pressing 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.519
 central although it still dominates the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.569
 match us from the inferior coins for 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.569
 see who touches balls 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.380
 he cut the thread by the thinnest he 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.500
 hit a listened to collect two to one a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.980
 the 39 pibes and baker was also 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.500
 a with already slim 3 - valid or wins 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.110
 central and five minutes slim got a 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.690
 zapatazo equal but god martínez and 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.680
 we said it was good because of the surprise 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.110
 Well obviously it's a good 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.230
 property that this boy treasures 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.330
 does not deviate the ball deviates 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.180
 gardens deviate martínez the ball 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.700
 that's why the path so rare that leaves 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.150
 without any chance to benítez 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.490
 regardless of it all the 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.440
 merit is thin that will look for that 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.880
 cuts diagonal to the middle that when 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.720
 grab the ball makes the decision to 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.010
 kick 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.990
 I insist central had stopped 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.870
 press but it was still the 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.210
 dominator of the encounter came out with another 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.530
 attitude of the second time and that's why to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.540
 this height must be said that he gave 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.310
 back the result is going to sit 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.100
 sure you have to wait there russian 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.540
 so victory is consumed here in 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.580
 the giant in this first game of 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.990
 championship for channels and brewers the 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.330
 warning of half tucked cent 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.180
 so that the header the rebound 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.860
 arch in back of barrientos returns 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.409
 to stay at a tempo does not end the 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.849
 see us claim that the end of the 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.110
 meeting ended clearly for you 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.849
 son since it is enabled accompanied 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.110
 for another semi lakers wants to finish the 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.460
 match the pair wedge wedges 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.420
 cachete goes cachete here to see what 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.990
 vaccine 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.990
 do not 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:32.080
 walter coins 3 to 1 remote central 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.270
 won by quilmes and wins first in his 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.790
 home 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.380
 that applies merlos regulation because 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.810
 when he announces what he is going to add 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.910
 to the party is the commitment that takes 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.610
 at least but if you understand that the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.540
 play has to finish the follow 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.540
 the game 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.760
 and he had quilmes and claimed the end 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.410
 ribbons central but recovered 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.290
 the team of Miguel Angel Russo 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.030
 in this way you see and here the 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.950
 referee correctly lets follow 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.900
 perfectly enabled coins because 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.820
 he is in his own field then he did 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.800
 still in look you had to think there was 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.020
 that hooking did not have to run so much 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.900
 I told them when he entered mint that this one 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.900
 for the last 25 meters know the 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.200
 last 60 meters or 50 meters a 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.930
 definition supported by technique rather than 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.180
 exquisite deserved to center so 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.520
 made the second time the closing of a 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.630
 perfect match for a coach who 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.790
 today celebrated as a technician of the scoundrel 200 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.040
 games three to one for the homeowner 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.820
 finished the match gentlemen in the kick 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.820
 soccer for all
