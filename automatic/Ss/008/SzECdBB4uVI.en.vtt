so now we're going to go over some
basics<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.510> harness<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.350> how<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> put<00:00:04.680> it

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710

made out of nylon like most of the Rope
used<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.510> rock<00:00:09.660> climbing<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.679> got<00:00:10.830> some

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
used in rock climbing it's got some

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
used in rock climbing it's got some
basic<00:00:11.340> parts<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.059> got<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> leg<00:00:12.900> loops

going to go around your base waste some

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
going to go around your base waste some
other<00:00:18.810> points<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> be<00:00:19.289> aware<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.189> belay

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
other points to be aware of is the belay

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
other points to be aware of is the belay
loop<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.199> power<00:00:22.410> point

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
loop and this is kind of a power point

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.230 
loop and this is kind of a power point
this<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.920> your<00:00:23.160> attachment<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> everything

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this is your attachment to everything

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.570 
this is your attachment to everything
that<00:00:24.420> you're<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.140> attached<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that you're going to be attached to and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.490 
that you're going to be attached to and
then<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.849> got<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.150> gear<00:00:27.539> loops<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.320> we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
then it's got these gear loops which we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
then it's got these gear loops which we
use<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:28.710> attaching<00:00:29.279> any<00:00:29.760> gear<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.300> you're

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
use for attaching any gear that you're

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.030 
use for attaching any gear that you're
going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> use<00:00:30.840> later<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.619> when<00:00:31.920> you're

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
going to use later on when you're

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to use later on when you're
climbing<00:00:32.930> now<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.530> designed<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
climbing now the way this is designed is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.420 
climbing now the way this is designed is
so<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.840> fall<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.950> Rope<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> going

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
so that when you fall the Rope is going

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030 
so that when you fall the Rope is going
to<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.960> leg<00:00:40.140> loops<00:00:40.379> are

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to get you here and the leg loops are

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.590 
to get you here and the leg loops are
going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> catch<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.640> legs<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
going to catch your legs so that the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.750 
going to catch your legs so that the
fall<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.110> comfortable<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.100> they

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
fall is as comfortable as it can be they

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
fall is as comfortable as it can be they
used<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.510> things<00:00:45.690> called<00:00:45.960> Swami

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
used to use just things called Swami

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
used to use just things called Swami
belts<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.190> basically<00:00:47.579> tying<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> rope

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
belts which is basically tying the rope

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
belts which is basically tying the rope
around<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.629> waist<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.649> imagine<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
around your waist you can imagine if you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.979 
around your waist you can imagine if you
fell<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.360> only<00:00:51.449> tied<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:51.809> your

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
fell and it was only tied around your

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
fell and it was only tied around your
waist<00:00:52.230> how<00:00:52.469> uncomfortable<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.460> even

waist how uncomfortable and even
dangerous<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.620> we'll<00:00:55.739> put

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
dangerous that could be so now we'll put

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.110 
dangerous that could be so now we'll put
on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> harness<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.640> naturally

falls into you can imagine how that's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.619 
falls into you can imagine how that's
going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.940> leg<00:01:03.149> loops<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
going to go on the leg loops and the

these these clasp right here make the
process<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.270> double<00:01:33.990> backing<00:01:34.439> irrelevant

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
process of double backing irrelevant

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
process of double backing irrelevant
what<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.909> an<00:01:36.150> old<00:01:36.329> fashioned

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
what you would do on an old fashioned

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
what you would do on an old fashioned
harness<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> when<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.070> through<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
harness is when it was through this

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
harness is when it was through this
you'd<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.030> take<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.570> nylon<00:01:39.930> loop<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you'd actually take your nylon loop and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
you'd actually take your nylon loop and
put<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.070> through<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> looks

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
put it back through so that it looks

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
put it back through so that it looks
like<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.700> safe

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
like that and that's when it was safe

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
like that and that's when it was safe
but<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> most<00:01:45.780> modern<00:01:46.110> harnesses<00:01:46.710> they've<00:01:46.920> got

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
but on most modern harnesses they've got
