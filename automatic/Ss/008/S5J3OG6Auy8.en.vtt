00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.450
 the frames you have at home are to be replaced or are recent actions 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.739
 recent 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.859
 the fairies are to be replaced 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.989
 and escorted to replace windows beasts with new fixtures a 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:24.109
 savings there are state deductions up to 55% of the expenses also exists 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.189
 cece ciato I think of you what brings sant'anna past for what I am not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.669
 neptune are good 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.700
 sensor operation we felt at about 3 years of life 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.340
 I'm quite recent 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.680
 they are not decent but they are not sestriere 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.400
 are fairly recent up 2 district untreated should I choose what i 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.190
 more important than the window 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.980
 thermal insulation conversation psycho beauty I have security against thieves 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.280
 but surely thermal insulation but then found tanaka had to live and for 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 as regards instead the aesthetic oleol security 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.620
 I would almost say security 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.650
 the courier supplies 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.460
 bee 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.530
 in my case they are 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.320
 macho all the center-distance safety instruments that are important 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.960
 tertiary improvement with also for accustic or mixed rice 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.320
 back cover I think of every moment 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 then everything else is also important 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.439
 you can all be all feed feeds ready for anything but not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.160
 thermal insulation 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.229
 in your opinion 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.069
 how much can a quality window frame that allows a 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.619
 high thermal and acoustic savings and we do not need any maintenance 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.420
 idea 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.509
 born in what sense how much it costs are various on the window only even on one 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.260
 window only 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.520
 and 401 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.660
 badoo I am not worthy of the however I believe that 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.830
 in this field the quality you pay dependent fish cost quite 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.860
 I don't put a window on it, I think it costs about shoes 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.370
 1000 euros 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.639
 about 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.970
 but a window or window type 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.259
 a door 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.099
 window window type 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.870
 weight from 500 to 1000 euros depending on the quality of the size not 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.900
 you can do that in that amount to think about it 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.019
 I would say 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 group from experience than lately 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.669
 from 800 thousand euros 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.319
 thousand euros 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.609
 ii according to you how important it is to install in a building 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.609
 new window frame 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.539
 deda 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:55.739
 sanson assembly summary of juvenile age importance this depends on 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.559
 technician who does 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.909
 work 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.059
 well I think it's very important because it's also fundamental for the 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.499
 speech and thermal insulation panels and to comment first 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.159
 siena chains were important terminating wife 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.739
 internet offers teletu very important very important film 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.509
 . 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.519
 the installation is very important 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.319
 to me I beat the technical assistance service to regulate yours 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.319
 windows how it went 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.529
 it worked on the first day and hopefully continue in short 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.639
 but 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.899
 honor on my shoulders of my son because 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.339
 it was changed again last year 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:45.289
 seychelles came to fix it well 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.889
 well they came to repair it 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.100
 but no anomalies are used 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.529
 postponed 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:56.919
 she knows the window at the manufacturer of part shutters windows what do you think 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.739
 I don't think I know anything for having seen a daily billboard 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.649
 But I don't think about advertising 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:11.439
 if I weigh the frames and we are valid and above all doors and windows in 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.980
 plastic to the face with good success 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.980
 or making money benelli c date we are indeed 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.680
 and very good summer 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.580
 perhaps better than wood because over time they always remain the same 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.639
 because I know the party is also for the varese I think I do not know if leading in 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.789
 sector o 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.789
 only one atom derives 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.780
 and if there is a serious company that works a lot of wood well under its own 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.689
 penis usually this case means that 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.279
 is that things work that go hand in hand 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.969
 God and I have never needed it today certainly but I know it as an invitation 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.969
 at dinner together with a very serious company 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.230
 I know them a little for advertising and also lately because 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.469
 and I did some work 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.979
 I think well because my daughter was mounted on the left 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.930
 I am fine only buildings that we have at 15 o'clock
