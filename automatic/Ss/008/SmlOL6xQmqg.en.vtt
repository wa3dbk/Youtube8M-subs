00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
explained how to do the glitch which is

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.910 
explained how to do the glitch which is
pretty<00:02:43.350> simple

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
pretty simple

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.120 
pretty simple
and<00:02:45.110> once<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.230> achieve<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.709> glitch<00:02:46.920> it's

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and once you achieve the glitch it's

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.750 
and once you achieve the glitch it's
pretty<00:02:47.310> awesome

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
pretty awesome

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
pretty awesome
it's<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.630> really<00:02:48.840> simple<00:02:49.260> there's<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.560> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it's it's really simple there's just a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.960 
it's it's really simple there's just a
couple<00:02:49.800> lines<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.130> code<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.520> got<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.730> put<00:02:50.880> into

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
couple lines of code you got to put into

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.040 
couple lines of code you got to put into
your<00:02:51.060> York<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.770> guess<00:02:53.730> some<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.660> your<00:02:54.750> TF

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
something like that but it's pretty

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.370 
something like that but it's pretty
simple<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.120> then<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> glitch

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
simple to do and then you can a glitch

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.850 
simple to do and then you can a glitch

the glitch but with the glitch you can
and<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.330> looks<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.720> looks<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.200> have

two unusual effects from one hat which
can<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.780> pretty<00:03:27.989> awesome<00:03:28.170> but<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.760> why

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
can be pretty awesome but that is why

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.810
