00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
you're still protected from the falling
rocks<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:58.910> still<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.090> lot<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.270> spawns

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
rocks but you still get a lot of spawns

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.470 
rocks but you still get a lot of spawns
i<00:03:01.040> really<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.370> spot<00:03:02.610> on<00:03:02.820> fields<00:03:03.240> nearly

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
i really like that spot on fields nearly

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.380 
i really like that spot on fields nearly
as<00:03:03.660> efficient<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.380> some<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.680> other<00:03:04.830> spots

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
as efficient and some of the other spots

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.780 
as efficient and some of the other spots
so<00:03:06.390> spot<00:03:06.900> number<00:03:07.050> two<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:08.300> right<00:03:09.300> here<00:03:10.790> you're

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
so spot number two is right here you're

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.920 
so spot number two is right here you're
actually<00:03:11.910> supposed<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.360> be<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.690> corner

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
actually supposed to be in that corner

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.830 
actually supposed to be in that corner
so<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.320> they<00:03:13.500> all<00:03:13.590> pile<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.630> same

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
so that they all pile but the same

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.380 
so that they all pile but the same
general<00:03:16.230> idea<00:03:16.380> i<00:03:16.820> really<00:03:17.820> like<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.030> spot

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
general idea i really like that spot

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.100 
general idea i really like that spot
either<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.800> well<00:03:20.720> number<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.870> he's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
either just because well number one he's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.680 
either just because well number one he's
there<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.650> number<00:03:22.980> two<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.520> don't<00:03:24.330> feel<00:03:24.510> it's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
there and number two I don't feel it's

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.260 
there and number two I don't feel it's
nearly<00:03:24.870> as<00:03:25.020> efficient<00:03:25.610> spot<00:03:26.610> number<00:03:26.850> three

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
nearly as efficient spot number three

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.220 
nearly as efficient spot number three
the<00:03:27.600> one<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.050> use<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.860> right<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.670> here<00:03:30.560> now

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
the one that I use is right up here now

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.590 
the one that I use is right up here now
to<00:03:34.230> use<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.590> spot<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.310> turn<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.180> your<00:03:36.210> prayer

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
to use the spot you turn on your prayer

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.780 
to use the spot you turn on your prayer
I<00:03:36.840> screw<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.800> last<00:03:38.010> time<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.460> you<00:03:38.550> want<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
I screw that up last time if you want to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.840 
I screw that up last time if you want to
see<00:03:38.940> my<00:03:39.150> worst<00:03:39.690> completionist<00:03:40.290> ever<00:03:40.850> you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
see my worst completionist ever you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.290 
see my worst completionist ever you
would<00:03:42.150> understand<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:44.160> equip<00:03:44.790> your<00:03:44.940> weapon

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
would understand you equip your weapon

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.800 
would understand you equip your weapon
and<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:46.770> watch<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.580> they<00:03:47.970> all<00:03:48.120> flock<00:03:48.510> talking

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and you watch as they all flock talking

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.080 
and you watch as they all flock talking
to<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.890> said<00:03:50.100> whatever<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.430> textile<00:03:50.940> you

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
to you you said whatever a textile you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.470 
to you you said whatever a textile you
want<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.570> then<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:53.160> start<00:03:53.640> an<00:03:53.730> attacking<00:03:54.060> as

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
want and then you start an attacking as

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.410 
want and then you start an attacking as
so<00:03:55.070> if<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.220> have<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> combat<00:03:56.730> familiar<00:03:57.060> it

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
so if you have a combat familiar it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.850 
so if you have a combat familiar it
definitely<00:03:57.690> speeds<00:03:58.410> up<00:03:58.680> your<00:03:59.480> XP<00:04:00.480> an<00:04:00.600> hour<00:04:00.860> so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
definitely speeds up your XP an hour so

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.710 
definitely speeds up your XP an hour so
you'll<00:04:02.490> want<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:03.000> starts<00:04:03.240> pecking<00:04:03.420> that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you'll want to just starts pecking that

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.390 
you'll want to just starts pecking that
