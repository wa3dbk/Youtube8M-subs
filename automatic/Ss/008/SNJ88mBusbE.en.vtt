the<00:02:23.620> beam<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:25.210> here<00:02:25.570> we<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.490> to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the beam so here we go this is to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.110 
the beam so here we go this is to
replicate<00:02:28.860> conditions<00:02:29.860> offshore<00:02:30.490> now<00:02:31.060> the

replicate conditions offshore now the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.720 
replicate conditions offshore now the
gyro<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:34.000> can<00:02:34.210> see<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:35.020> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
gyro is on and you can see that it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.690 
gyro is on and you can see that it
incredibly<00:02:36.900> dampens<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:39.870> jerky<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.700> radical

according<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.270> our<00:02:46.360> measurements<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.500> boats

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
according to our measurements the boats

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.970 
according to our measurements the boats
average<00:02:48.250> roll<00:02:48.550> with<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.120> gyro<00:02:49.570> on<00:02:49.870> was<00:02:50.680> five

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
average roll with the gyro on was five

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.730 
average roll with the gyro on was five

off<00:02:59.190> the<00:03:00.190> gyro<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.850> off<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.730> we're<00:03:04.060> going

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
off the gyro is off and and we're going

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.260 
off the gyro is off and and we're going
to<00:03:04.270> see<00:03:04.480> how<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.960> boat<00:03:05.290> rolls<00:03:05.620> with<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.790> gyro

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
to see how the boat rolls with the gyro

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.510 
to see how the boat rolls with the gyro
off

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.190 

that's<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.760> weight<00:03:12.940> from<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.320> 47<00:03:14.320> footer

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
that's the weight from the 47 footer

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.340 
that's the weight from the 47 footer
quite<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> big<00:03:17.470> difference<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.460> can<00:03:18.550> see<00:03:19.350> we

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
quite a big difference so you can see we

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.620 
quite a big difference so you can see we
measured<00:03:20.770> an<00:03:20.920> average<00:03:21.310> role<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.910> ten<00:03:22.300> point

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
measured an average role of ten point

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.290 
measured an average role of ten point
six<00:03:22.870> degrees<00:03:23.020> in<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.770> test<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.820> gyro

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
six degrees in this test with the gyro

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.490 
six degrees in this test with the gyro
off<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.610> just<00:03:27.970> enough<00:03:28.300> roll<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:29.080> get<00:03:29.260> your

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
off this is just enough roll to get your

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.590 
off this is just enough roll to get your
plate<00:03:29.860> sliding<00:03:30.340> across<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.790> table<00:03:31.360> or<00:03:31.570> to

plate sliding across the table or to

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.380 
plate sliding across the table or to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
cause queasiness in a guest unused to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.080 
cause queasiness in a guest unused to

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
being at sea Darren's lying the boat up

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.230 
being at sea Darren's lying the boat up
and<00:03:37.270> it's<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.840> take<00:03:38.050> us<00:03:38.200> right<00:03:38.320> a<00:03:38.500> beam

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
and it's going to take us right a beam

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:50.820 
and it's going to take us right a beam
so<00:03:40.240> this<00:03:40.570> will<00:03:40.750> be<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.900> good<00:03:41.200> test

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.900 

yeah<00:03:51.400> definitely<00:03:52.390> definitely<00:03:53.760> dampens<00:03:54.760> it

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
yeah definitely definitely dampens it

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.570 
yeah definitely definitely dampens it

four hours conducting these tests I can
