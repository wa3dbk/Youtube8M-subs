that one's cheaper I'll get that one for
them<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.230> think<00:03:30.470> that's<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.650> very<00:03:30.769> valid<00:03:31.040> point<00:03:31.160> I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
them I think that's a very valid point I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.830 
them I think that's a very valid point I

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
mean it used to be let's go play Atari

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.050 
mean it used to be let's go play Atari
let's<00:03:33.140> play<00:03:33.350> Nintendo<00:03:33.830> but<00:03:34.010> Paul<00:03:34.220> should<00:03:34.790> Sony

let's play Nintendo but Paul should Sony

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.610 
let's play Nintendo but Paul should Sony

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
worried that that in a few years time it

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.680 
worried that that in a few years time it
might<00:03:36.680> be<00:03:36.739> let's<00:03:36.980> play<00:03:37.220> xbox<00:03:37.760> or<00:03:37.940> Wii<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.360> not

early to predict something like that oh

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.660 
early to predict something like that oh
I<00:03:42.530> think<00:03:42.709> they<00:03:42.920> absolutely<00:03:43.160> should<00:03:43.640> be

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
I think they absolutely should be

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.120 
I think they absolutely should be
worried<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.120> mean<00:03:44.299> I've<00:03:44.450> seen<00:03:44.830> sitcoms<00:03:45.830> where

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
worried I mean I've seen sitcoms where

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.100 
worried I mean I've seen sitcoms where
they<00:03:46.280> make<00:03:46.520> jokes<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.360> generic<00:03:47.840> name

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
they make jokes and the generic name

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.559 
they make jokes and the generic name
they<00:03:48.319> use<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.800> Xbox<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.430> does<00:03:49.610> happen<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.209> they

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
they use is Xbox it does happen and they

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:51.610 
they use is Xbox it does happen and they
you<00:03:50.810> know<00:03:50.959> they<00:03:51.110> have<00:03:51.140> to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
you know they have to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.559 
you know they have to
be<00:03:51.830> mindful<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.580> what<00:03:52.849> has<00:03:53.000> happened<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.420> hope

they<00:03:53.720> read<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.140> egm<00:03:54.530> article<00:03:54.980> because<00:03:55.459> I

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
they read the egm article because I

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.520 
they read the egm article because I
think<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.629> they<00:03:56.930> need<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.230> know<00:03:57.409> that

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
think that they need to know that

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.440 
think that they need to know that
they're<00:03:57.860> there<00:03:57.890> in<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.340> world<00:03:58.849> of<00:03:59.030> hurt<00:03:59.239> right

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
they're there in a world of hurt right

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.570 
they're there in a world of hurt right
now<00:03:59.629> and<00:03:59.870> this<00:04:00.319> next<00:04:00.650> year<00:04:00.799> is<00:04:00.890> critical<00:04:01.400> for

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
now and this next year is critical for

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.339 
now and this next year is critical for
them<00:04:01.700> if<00:04:01.849> they<00:04:02.060> don't<00:04:02.420> make<00:04:02.629> significant

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
them if they don't make significant

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.619 
them if they don't make significant
leaps<00:04:03.680> forward<00:04:04.069> then<00:04:04.819> then<00:04:05.269> it's<00:04:05.450> really

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
leaps forward then then it's really

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.930 
leaps forward then then it's really
problematic<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.379> mean<00:04:06.530> when<00:04:06.709> let's<00:04:07.670> put<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.879> to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
problematic I mean when let's put it to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.920 
problematic I mean when let's put it to
you<00:04:08.000> this<00:04:08.120> way<00:04:08.180> we<00:04:08.510> should<00:04:08.569> have<00:04:08.690> this

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
you this way we should have this

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.869 
you this way we should have this
discussion<00:04:09.319> in<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.709> year<00:04:10.040> because<00:04:10.400> after<00:04:10.700> then

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
discussion in a year because after then

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.089 
discussion in a year because after then
this<00:04:11.209> coming<00:04:11.659> holiday<00:04:11.840> season<00:04:12.500> if<00:04:12.620> there's

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
this coming holiday season if there's

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.130 
this coming holiday season if there's
still<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.670> far<00:04:13.909> behind<00:04:14.090> then<00:04:14.810> they're<00:04:15.019> in

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
still this far behind then they're in

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.610 
still this far behind then they're in
trouble

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
trouble

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.080 
trouble
yeah<00:04:16.040> well<00:04:16.220> Dan<00:04:16.400> no<00:04:16.669> what<00:04:16.790> do<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:16.910> think<00:04:17.030> about

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
yeah well Dan no what do you think about

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.759 
yeah well Dan no what do you think about
that<00:04:17.209> because<00:04:17.449> it<00:04:17.630> seemed<00:04:17.780> like<00:04:17.810> sony<00:04:18.229> sony

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
that because it seemed like sony sony

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.500 
that because it seemed like sony sony
they're<00:04:19.160> they're<00:04:19.400> reluctant<00:04:20.000> at<00:04:20.090> best<00:04:20.299> to

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
they're they're reluctant at best to

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.909 
they're they're reluctant at best to
admit<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.930> they<00:04:21.079> might<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.350> in<00:04:21.440> any<00:04:21.650> bit<00:04:21.889> of

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
admit that they might be in any bit of

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.830 
admit that they might be in any bit of
hurt<00:04:22.280> let<00:04:22.490> alone<00:04:22.639> a<00:04:22.699> whole<00:04:22.850> world<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> do

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
hurt let alone a whole world of it do

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.090 
hurt let alone a whole world of it do
you<00:04:23.870> think<00:04:24.020> they're<00:04:24.139> banking<00:04:24.470> on<00:04:24.590> on<00:04:24.800> blu-ray

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
you think they're banking on on blu-ray

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.460 
you think they're banking on on blu-ray
and<00:04:25.639> on<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.630> raw<00:04:26.750> horsepower<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.440> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
and on this the raw horsepower of the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.990 
and on this the raw horsepower of the
console<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.310> keep<00:04:28.460> them<00:04:28.610> going<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:28.970> year

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
console to to keep them going this year

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.040 
console to to keep them going this year
or<00:04:29.330> are<00:04:29.360> we<00:04:29.479> gonna<00:04:29.600> finally<00:04:29.870> see<00:04:29.930> some

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
or are we gonna finally see some

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.900 
or are we gonna finally see some
exclusives<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.889> some<00:04:31.280> good<00:04:31.430> games<00:04:31.550> coming

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
exclusives and some good games coming

exclusives and some good games coming
out

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
out

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.180 
out
I<00:04:32.270> think<00:04:33.050> blu-ray<00:04:33.440> is<00:04:33.620> part<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:33.949> the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
I think blu-ray is part of the

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.340 
I think blu-ray is part of the
horsepower<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.060> definitely<00:04:35.510> part<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.930> but

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
horsepower is definitely part of it but

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.300 
horsepower is definitely part of it but
the<00:04:36.470> thing<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.770> they're<00:04:36.949> not<00:04:37.039> really

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
the thing is they're not really

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.680 
the thing is they're not really
delivering<00:04:37.490> on<00:04:38.120> everything<00:04:38.539> they're

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
delivering on everything they're

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.240 
delivering on everything they're
promising<00:04:39.289> you<00:04:39.380> know<00:04:39.500> there<00:04:39.860> aren't<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.070> lot<00:04:40.100> of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
promising you know there aren't a lot of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.460 
promising you know there aren't a lot of
blu-ray<00:04:40.610> movies<00:04:40.970> out<00:04:41.180> there<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.630> the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
blu-ray movies out there and the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.710 
blu-ray movies out there and the
horsepower<00:04:42.770> these<00:04:43.699> games<00:04:44.000> do<00:04:44.270> not<00:04:44.300> look<00:04:44.690> like

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
horsepower these games do not look like

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.360 
horsepower these games do not look like
what<00:04:45.080> they<00:04:45.169> show<00:04:45.410> for<00:04:45.440> target<00:04:46.010> videos<00:04:46.340> a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
what they show for target videos a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.400 
what they show for target videos a
couple<00:04:46.729> years<00:04:46.910> ago<00:04:47.000> at<00:04:47.300> our<00:04:47.810> trade<00:04:48.169> show

catch<00:06:15.539> up<00:06:15.750> with<00:06:15.780> their<00:06:16.020> online<00:06:16.169> network<00:06:16.650> I

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
catch up with their online network I

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.890 
catch up with their online network I
think<00:06:17.639> so<00:06:17.849> I<00:06:17.879> mean<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.389> know<00:06:18.509> they<00:06:18.689> need<00:06:18.870> to

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
think so I mean you know they need to

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.529 
think so I mean you know they need to
look<00:06:19.139> at<00:06:19.289> what<00:06:19.469> Xbox<00:06:19.889> Live<00:06:20.159> does<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.939> sort<00:06:21.479> of

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
look at what Xbox Live does and sort of

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:22.999 
look at what Xbox Live does and sort of
mirror<00:06:21.840> that<00:06:22.020> which<00:06:22.229> they've<00:06:22.439> done<00:06:22.469> a<00:06:22.680> little

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
mirror that which they've done a little

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.230 
mirror that which they've done a little
bit<00:06:23.129> but<00:06:23.310> they<00:06:23.400> need<00:06:23.550> to<00:06:23.639> catch<00:06:23.849> up<00:06:23.879> because

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
bit but they need to catch up because

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.300 
bit but they need to catch up because
they're<00:06:24.360> sort<00:06:24.840> of<00:06:24.930> Xbox<00:06:25.650> LIVE<00:06:25.889> like<00:06:26.129> nine

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
they're sort of Xbox LIVE like nine

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.100 
they're sort of Xbox LIVE like nine
months<00:06:26.550> ago<00:06:26.789> but<00:06:27.300> I<00:06:27.330> think<00:06:27.599> actually<00:06:27.780> while

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
months ago but I think actually while

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.959 
months ago but I think actually while
they<00:06:28.259> really<00:06:28.590> need<00:06:28.770> is<00:06:28.949> one<00:06:29.219> really<00:06:29.520> great

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
they really need is one really great

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.540 
they really need is one really great
online<00:06:30.240> game<00:06:30.840> they<00:06:31.349> need<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:31.650> halo<00:06:32.099> 2<00:06:32.159> they

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
online game they need a halo 2 they

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.550 
online game they need a halo 2 they
needed<00:06:32.909> Gears<00:06:33.120> of<00:06:33.180> War<00:06:33.300> if<00:06:33.689> they<00:06:34.110> find<00:06:34.409> the

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
needed Gears of War if they find the

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.890 
needed Gears of War if they find the
game<00:06:34.740> that<00:06:34.770> really<00:06:35.129> pushes<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.909> I<00:06:36.090> think<00:06:36.750> it'll

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
game that really pushes it I think it'll

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.929 
game that really pushes it I think it'll
help<00:06:36.960> a<00:06:37.229> lot<00:06:37.409> all<00:06:38.099> right<00:06:38.159> so<00:06:38.430> one<00:06:38.610> year<00:06:38.759> from

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
help a lot all right so one year from

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.369 
help a lot all right so one year from
now<00:06:39.000> Paul<00:06:39.360> in<00:06:39.509> your<00:06:39.629> mind<00:06:39.810> who<00:06:39.990> is<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.229> leader

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
now Paul in your mind who is the leader

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.469 
now Paul in your mind who is the leader
in<00:06:40.500> this<00:06:40.590> console<00:06:40.979> war<00:06:41.159> oh<00:06:41.370> I<00:06:41.879> still<00:06:42.270> think

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
in this console war oh I still think

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.439 
in this console war oh I still think
Xbox<00:06:42.870> will<00:06:43.080> be<00:06:43.229> the<00:06:43.409> leader<00:06:43.650> it<00:06:44.639> only<00:06:45.090> began

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
Xbox will be the leader it only began

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.179 
Xbox will be the leader it only began
because<00:06:45.750> they<00:06:46.020> have<00:06:46.199> a<00:06:46.229> year<00:06:46.529> I<00:06:46.680> think

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
because they have a year I think

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.429 
because they have a year I think
oh<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.879> gap<00:06:48.120> will<00:06:48.360> be<00:06:48.389> much<00:06:48.779> much<00:06:49.050> smaller

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
oh the gap will be much much smaller

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.950 
oh the gap will be much much smaller
between<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.550> three<00:06:50.759> of<00:06:50.789> them<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.479> Wii<00:06:51.659> to<00:06:51.840> me

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
between the three of them the Wii to me

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.469 
between the three of them the Wii to me
is<00:06:52.110> actually<00:06:52.529> more<00:06:52.770> of<00:06:53.009> a<00:06:53.159> I<00:06:53.520> mean<00:06:53.909> I'm<00:06:54.300> not

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
is actually more of a I mean I'm not

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:55.580 
is actually more of a I mean I'm not
sure<00:06:54.659> what<00:06:54.810> the<00:06:54.870> word<00:06:54.900> would<00:06:55.169> be<00:06:55.199> but<00:06:55.469> like

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
sure what the word would be but like

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.200 
sure what the word would be but like
it's<00:06:55.770> almost<00:06:55.860> a<00:06:56.009> wild<00:06:56.430> card<00:06:56.669> like<00:06:56.849> it<00:06:56.969> could<00:06:57.180> be

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
it's almost a wild card like it could be

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.510 
it's almost a wild card like it could be
an<00:06:57.419> utter<00:06:57.569> disaster<00:06:57.779> still<00:06:58.379> it<00:06:58.590> could<00:06:58.770> be<00:06:58.919> just

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
an utter disaster still it could be just

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.399 
an utter disaster still it could be just
a<00:06:59.610> huge<00:06:59.819> monster<00:07:00.300> but<00:07:00.479> I<00:07:00.539> think<00:07:00.779> between<00:07:00.900> Sony

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.409 
a huge monster but I think between Sony

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.129 
a huge monster but I think between Sony
and<00:07:01.710> and<00:07:02.009> Xbox<00:07:02.879> it'll<00:07:03.150> be<00:07:03.240> a<00:07:03.270> much<00:07:03.479> closer<00:07:03.810> race

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
and and Xbox it'll be a much closer race

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.779 
and and Xbox it'll be a much closer race
but<00:07:04.469> I<00:07:04.680> think<00:07:05.009> Microsoft<00:07:05.430> will<00:07:05.520> still<00:07:05.699> be

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789 
but I think Microsoft will still be

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.490 
but I think Microsoft will still be
