00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.850
 perceive mud and the ju with the throne 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.130
 pickering is they realized that there were 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.410
 strangers for information in the orbit of 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.840
 uranium and even neptune, then 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.760
 they started doing some work 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.099
 for discovering another for a 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.009
 planet close to return affecting 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.380
 then in its orbit let's say this 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.230
 question of disturbance did not find 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.329
 14 years after his death as early as 18 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.430
 February 1930 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.980
 okay this new celestial object he was 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.680
 discovered that was is by an auxiliary 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.800
 of him a star in the young man named kai eide 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 right then clear who was noted for 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.270
 for the first time a planet the pluto is 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 this was in 1930 that date is important 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.170
 that there are some curious facts there 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.870
 what happened 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.990
 the magazine team at the time launched a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.970
 challenge to what name then it would be given 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.979
 Pluto and then a girl of 11 years 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.909
 age at the time to the city of oxford 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.880
 in England she sent the idea 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.240
 proposal of this new object was then 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.969
 discovered 1930 to be called pluto in the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.600
 Roman mythology means god in us 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.460
 dead and riches also one of the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.920
 moons of pluto is called a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.289
 boatman who takes the living to the world 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.579
 of the dead they liked this suggestion 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:41.060
 of the idea why pl submits to 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.209
 aaa percival load the initials of the name 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.889
 perceive soon and and in another curious fact 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:51.350
 Also that runs in this game season is that 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:54.529
 there was munique mickey from disney 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.869
 he had a dog is yours 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.670
 doggie not a pet 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.219
 but still had no name there either 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.569
 where it took is all this uproar 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.609
 who was having and called that 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.580
 pluto dog that we know is 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.010
 the mickey dog then the pluto is that 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.340
 there is the name given in English Pluto 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.800
 was actually given because of that name 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.340
 that was given to the planet itself but in 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.650
 1932 soon after the discovery 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 on duty in the name of what is a planet 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.760
 this on August 24 , 2006 planet is a 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.569
 celestial body orbiting around the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.200
 The sun has a rounded shape and it is a 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.480
 which is the predominant 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.549
 other objects that are in your 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.069
 orbit other lines 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.319
 only what pluto if you look at this 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.510
 definition in its orbit there are so many 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.629
 other objects also in the middle 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.150
 okay so this condition does not henrique 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.130
 needs to be a dimension object 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.470
 predominantly among the others that 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.349
 in orbit to neighbors causes 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.500
 that it is not a planet and becomes 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.980
 a planet not according to Nelson in the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.099
 International 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.170
 Pluto is planet does not give 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.209
 What happens is a very strong lobby. 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.489
 I even talked to one of the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.069
 participants of this meeting 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.190
 of the International Astronomical Union 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.620
 And she said it 's closed, I do not know 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.910
 opens more is a closed setting is over 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.519
 but the Americans are constantly 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.970
 insist to say we replace Pluto 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.970
 as a planet and not a dwarf planet 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.519
 you could measure the diameter of that 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.950
 planet passing through his equator you 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.950
 has 2,302 km which means that the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.849
 land is 12,756 kilometers in diameter 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.599
 equatorial 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.370
 it is 5.5 times smaller than land if 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.299
 I could put it comfortably 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.299
 inside Brazil
