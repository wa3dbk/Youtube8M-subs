jumper<00:00:59.039> -<00:00:59.280> 18<00:01:01.579> okay<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:02.789> we're<00:01:03.090> connecting<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
jumper - 18 okay now we're connecting it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.289 
jumper - 18 okay now we're connecting it
to<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> computer<00:01:04.610> here<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> bottom<00:01:06.000> right

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

to the computer here on the bottom right
you'll<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.140> has<00:01:07.290> four<00:01:07.619> sets<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you'll see that it has four sets of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.260 
you'll see that it has four sets of
different<00:01:08.130> sensors<00:01:08.720> for<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> 10<00:01:10.080> DOF<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
different sensors for the 10 DOF and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.560 
different sensors for the 10 DOF and
then<00:01:12.920> here's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> bigger<00:01:14.340> screen<00:01:14.790> shot<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
then here's a bigger screen shot of it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
then here's a bigger screen shot of it
and<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.400> four

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and you can see that there's four

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
and you can see that there's four
different<00:01:17.700> sets<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> shows<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> sensors<00:01:19.590> are

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
different sets and shows the sensors are

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
different sets and shows the sensors are
working<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> different

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
working now this is a different

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
working now this is a different
quadcopter<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.049> shows<00:01:22.380> 6<00:01:22.740> DOF

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
quadcopter that shows 6 DOF

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
quadcopter that shows 6 DOF
with<00:01:23.549> only<00:01:23.820> 2<00:01:24.210> sensors<00:01:25.670> now<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> show

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
with only 2 sensors now I want to show

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.399 
with only 2 sensors now I want to show
you<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.780> has<00:01:30.990> built-in

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you that this has built-in

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
you that this has built-in
OSD<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.700> we're<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:33.000> connect<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> battery

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
OSD so we're gonna connect the battery

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.280 
OSD so we're gonna connect the battery
to<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> quadcopter<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.150> turn<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.020> so

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
to to the quadcopter and turn it on so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.520 
to to the quadcopter and turn it on so
that<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.650> see<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.369> has<00:01:38.430> built-in

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.330 

okay<00:01:46.070> now<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.340> battery<00:01:46.730> is<00:01:46.790> connected<00:01:48.340> here

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
okay now the battery is connected here

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120 
okay now the battery is connected here
on<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.610> screen<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:49.940> can<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:51.530> shows

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:09.639 

it<00:01:59.330> shows<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.660> horizon<00:02:01.960> an<00:02:02.960> angle<00:02:04.540> pitch<00:02:08.649> and

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
it shows the horizon an angle pitch and

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.720 
it shows the horizon an angle pitch and
yaw

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

to 1,600 one thing about it is that the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.270 
to 1,600 one thing about it is that the
the<00:03:35.800> connector<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.790> uses<00:03:37.270> XT<00:03:37.930> 30<00:03:38.440> instead<00:03:39.070> of

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
the connector it uses XT 30 instead of

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.810 
the connector it uses XT 30 instead of
the<00:03:39.730> xt60<00:03:40.510> what's<00:03:41.080> usually<00:03:41.590> what<00:03:42.550> we<00:03:42.670> would

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
the xt60 what's usually what we would

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.699 
the xt60 what's usually what we would
see<00:03:43.060> when<00:03:43.270> we<00:03:43.360> buy<00:03:43.510> batteries<00:03:45.420> anyways<00:03:49.709> well

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
see when we buy batteries anyways well

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.380 
see when we buy batteries anyways well
this<00:03:50.950> concludes<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.640> introduction<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.180> the
