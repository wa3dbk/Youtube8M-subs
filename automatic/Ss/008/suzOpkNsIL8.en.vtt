 hello everybody today takes you to mine 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.560
 land of origin to piacenza and we prepare 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.660
 together the recipe of pisarei and fasò 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.090
 first we start to prepare the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 gravy and we will need tomato puree 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 oil an onion borlotti beans a 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.170
 pinch of salt for the dough instead there 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.980
 will serve milk and breadcrumbs flour 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.800
 water 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:05.509
 let's start hoping for the onion and reducing it 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:07.009
 the fine pieces we take the oil e 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.340
 let's start making our sauté 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.720
 add the hot oil and the onion 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.320
 we give a shuffle and we do 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.330
 slowly fry the onion 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.310
 add the borlotti beans to ours 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.850
 fried and let go for some 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.850
 minute 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.860
 at this point we can add the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.510
 tomato sauce with our beans e 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.690
 let it cook add a pinch 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.240
 of salt and then with the lid we cover 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.620
 ours on that we leave it in 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.320
 set aside to cook while we 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.640
 we will prepare the dough of pisarei 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.229
 take a saucepan and go to 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.770
 heat the milk we need 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.770
 boiling 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.020
 while milk warms up on a pastry board 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.220
 we pour a pile of breadcrumbs and a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.200
 pile of flour and let's try 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.500
 get a kind of fountain from 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.330
 will pay state we take milk and it 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 let's add gently to the floor 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.210
 top and breadcrumbs and mix it with 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.210
 a spoon 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.129
 now we can incorporate the flour a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.690
 breadcrumbs and possibly add 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.690
 a little water if the fabric is flushed 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.349
 add it slowly because it doesn't have to 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.120
 turn out to be too sticky 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.120
 it must be soft but not sticky 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.990
 once finished kneading 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.450
 we can put some breadcrumbs in 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.569
 a dish on which we will then put the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.760
 our pisarei and now we prepare the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.520
 our sight the pisarei take the name 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.560
 from this it sets in dialect 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.780
 Piacenza means precisely snake and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.530
 now we prepare our Pisans with the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.290
 left hand 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.709
 take a little bit of pasta and with your hand 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.900
 right 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.180
 we work quickly by sliding 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.180
 the pis the pali ce on the pastry board 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.750
 when we finish the first snake 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.960
 we can transfer the pisarei to ours 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.960
 dish 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.770
 but our pisarei will be ready 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.860
 we can put them to cook in one 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.569
 pot of salted water 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.440
 in the meantime we can put the sauce 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.440
 in a baking dish 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.480
 once you 're there, they start coming 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.730
 afloat we leave one more to boil 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.060
 minute and then we can drain them put them 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.060
 in the south 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.150
 at this point our pisarei are 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.010
 ready to be brought to the table and 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.020
