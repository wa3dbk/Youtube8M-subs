00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:26.110
 this exercise Monday usually the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.110
 Monday 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.080
 Y 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.860
 but they say 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.600
 ok walmart is sometimes back 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.329
 light 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.200
 because on Wednesdays I do legs 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.670
 but on Wednesdays I focus 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.950
 more in the quadriceps 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.950
 which I make a wall 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 the trapezoids do not work more than 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 once every two or three months because it is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.400
 very fast and it is matched by others well 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.520
 I do not know 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.700
 but if you will work on them, I will arrange here the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.830
 Friday afternoon except arms but if the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.460
 heavy arm 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.600
 or more intense more concentrated more 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.290
 turn is the arm and on Saturdays 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.290
 again legs 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.530
 more focused 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.530
 moral antrum 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.549
 ok on Sundays on Sunday the 31st 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.320
 train or when I'm in clean do not go 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 on Sundays when I'm not in cleaning 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.689
 and I have so many foods and good meals 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.450
 and I feel physically well among the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.630
 friends then I would repeat the south another 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.630
 time 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.230
 this is an asterisk because not always 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.020
 I do it ok 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:22.200
 now let's explain 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.030
 part calf as is my part 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.440
 and it's part of the challenge is calf and 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.650
 lower back 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.650
 the works monday wednesday 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.860
 and Friday 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.830
 three times a week his part shores 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.080

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.750
 dead today for extensions and both 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.720
 queen routine of four exercises of 12 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.770
 to 15 respectively 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.770
 to address this 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.020
 because it is passion 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.530
 the muscle that touches the main one but 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.290
 leave it as I do 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.830
 let's say I start chest I start with 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.830
 cables 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.470
 I said oh 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.960
 something that will be 34 laps of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 intersections to start quite 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.360
 joints that move well all 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.480
 warm up and after that I already had a 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.480
 Free heavy exercise can be good 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.760
 removed 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.670
 the light 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.000
 down can be like ropes 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.000
 etcetera 1 free ok 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.540
 I start with a light one 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.250
 warming that the second exercise 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.250
 caixa embargo heavy ones 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.450
 free 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.560
 either express chest and back already 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.190
 understands the squats already named 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.430
 a press like in ropes in arms of 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.160
 turmeric recipe and again in legs a 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.740
 dead weight started by moral ok weight 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.610
 Free expressed series of 8 repetitions 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.610
 of 20 laps and always to a third 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.040
 in this isolation handling sections 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.050
 more slowly more than individual 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.450
 let's say in breasts handling cables 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.160
 individual or can be a machine 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.120
 credit is individual we tighten a 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.760
 second 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.730
 returning individual space always 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.120
 to isolate well the muscle that is would be 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.110
 is third normally here I'm going to a 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.840
 misery 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.540
 4 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.540
 5 would be a misery 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.259
 I did not stop him to come back let's say 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.810
 for example in chest I go here they look 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.580
 three planes here the misery I'm going to poke 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.400
 more for those inclined equally a 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.860
 little heavy 10 and then combine with 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.190
 a pumping that can be lizards with 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.949
 the closed arms 25 that one heavy on 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.949
 the vision is a light one with I see 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:31.520
 although the 4th and 5th and 6th Aug 34 laps 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:38.690
 many closures and here of 2025 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:43.069
 ok we go to the sixth in the sixth that to 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.710
 sometimes I can do six laps of 15 a 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.080
 just take a break to see flavors 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.750
 that kristen you have to start 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.260
 unite all maybe something the one that publishes 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.570
 this week that are 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.980
 three people doing no exercise 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:03.570
 and tensions rest here in this one 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.570
 always invent 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.449
 here I do not have one key but almost 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.119
 always as I say I do something different 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.830
 every day in this exercise not 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:21.129
 always 25 exercises seemed like 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:24.009
 you know 4 sometimes at 33 to 27 but I 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.319
 Like I like to be like this I get routine 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.529
 like to put the heavy in the second already 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.699
 that my muscles like to put in the 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.399
 third party mix 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.949
 with that meter of being and in the third and 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:37.569
 he changed it because of the marginalization 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.909
 it's always the same does not have a routine 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.870
 established but this is a system in 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.270
 which, mentally, I rely on 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.949
 even if I did not think about it, I had a 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.339
 training and has been aware that what 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.979
 I made similar to this try to do it and 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:57.770
 they will serve this consistency of 20 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:04.460
 network this from 8 to 6 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:06.710
 hodges the order of 12 and 8 and 57 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.990
 there's a long crazy thing to do that the 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.379
 muscle gets tired of going back and it's not going to 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.690
 finish your routine or what we do is going to 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.610
 be good too and this decision no longer 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.180
 It takes a long time and it has served me 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.280
 you are going to notice that your physique is excellent 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.229
 it starts to match everywhere 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.520
 equally end I found weak by 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.129
 example back 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.960
 only my back attracts the dots 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:32.569
 weak just doubt it by your hand 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:37.930
 make champion it's good to express that 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:37.930
 He liked it like that between the pure river champion
