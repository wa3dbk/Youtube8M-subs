00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.060
 present two easy decorations and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.859
 fast made with frost on angles 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.450
 so that they are very suitable for 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.450
 professionals for bastard breaks 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.820
 and yes Wednesday I totally 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 broken my angle that's why I have them 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 a little repair in resin because 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.450
 I had too much pain and I have everything 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.400
 shortcut 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.570
 so I guess a lot of between 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.460
 you will be happy that I have the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.369
 short nails of objects to have laid a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 pink varnish 2 and 6 then I applied some 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.650
 top coat and with the finger I posed the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.180
 golden pigment so it's a pigment of 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.250
 at emi but you can very well 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 take eyeshadow for example 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 so I tap to make my gradient 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.710
 then I take the special foils gel 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.510
 abc nike store 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 I then take my detail brush 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 special synthetic hair gel very 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.909
 end with points there it's hard it's 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.190
 really great for making patterns 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.080
 super end there was then this new 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 carousel shah deniz so these are 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.159
 small golden shapes that I found very 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.379
 nice so I'm going to place them have just 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.820
 by raising the collar of my nail just 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.070
 to be able to place my motive 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.229
 correctly and then with the gel 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 excavations and the brush I'm going to draw 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.220
 so spirals and drops 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 so do not apply the gel 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 to do too much otherwise the foil is not going 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.950
 adhere neither too thick because otherwise he 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 will not be enough to catalyze and when 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.360
 you're going to press with the paper it's okay 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.480
 explode in fact so you can do 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.700
 really what you want as a motive 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.800
 and then you catalyze the pattern a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 minute thirty under UV lamp no more 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.410
 then I apply my foil paper adcenter 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.090
 golden over it so I press and I 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.370
 withdraw and if it will not fit well you 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.010
 put a piece over and you 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.380
 remove I then protect it with 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.060
 fire of the semi permanent varnish not to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 that it is there bim and for really good 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.180
 protect him 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 I take this opportunity to put my form and I 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 catalysis I then apply a second 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.690
 semi- permanent varnish layer for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.970
 well protect and I fill a little bit 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.580
 my form with to seal it well for 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.860
 although it takes the game of fats 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 everything I apply then with a small 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.780
 few permanent semi of in a few 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.879
 glitter for that saab laugh and I 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.489
 covers a permanent semi dom or 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.230
 of freeze so here you have created a 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.590
 little liquid stone a very gem 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.970
 easy to do just 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.250
 read any shape that you 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.629
 so, that's a little bit thick 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.400
 for natural golds but 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.450
 personally it did not bother me I do not 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.959
 am not too much at home is nothing and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.209
 sathonay super good for the 2nd decoration 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.400
 sugar effect I took gel white paint 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.860
 to lower the blinds without residue is 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.370
 very important so the base is just 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.069
 a nail not been with the tough rating of 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.989
 ask there defect effect sugar is realized 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.150
 really when your nail and finish 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.940
 over the top shell or over the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.860
 finishing gel I 'm applying so end I 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.470
 draws traits always with the same 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.959
 perso and the heathland gene that you can 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.640
 draw what you want I take 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.750
 then white resin not been 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.840
 you have the references in the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.459
 description I sprinkle over you 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.560
 can also rectified just before 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.420
 catalyze by scratching a little bit the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.760
 sides for you to do it again with 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.980
 a spike will catalyze you so normally 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.780
 two minutes lift or on the help and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.579
 then brush the pattern and then 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.069
 leave it as is, we do not put anything 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.049
 it's over I hope this 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.450
 tutorial did you like do not worry I 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.000
 will also make tutoring easier with 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.350
 just polish and all that if you have 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.840
 ideas one of the suggestions do not hesitate 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.079
 not to write to me in comment to 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.079
 soon
