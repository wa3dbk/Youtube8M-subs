00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello to all of you it's steven 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.150
 and today I will give you 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.460
 several tips for the battery 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.240
 your iphone ipod touch or ipad hard 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.340
 longer 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 so as you know it's not a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.699
 secret on apple devices 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.439
 unfortunately the battery 10 minutes 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.269
 very very fast so we will try 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 to improve all that to have a battery 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.900
 which lasts as long as possible 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.730
 first thing you go in the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 settings and you go down a little bit 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 in the privacy section just 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 here we will go to manage the service of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.680
 location that is useful in not bad 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.510
 applications such as 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.030
 plans to locate you as his name 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 the indicated so there me I loved it aof I 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.329
 really advise you to do that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 the location service that's eating a 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.530
 sacred package of batteries so being 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 aof you are already going to save some 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.879
 badly you can as well on the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.350
 leave to eaunes but in this case me I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.520
 advise you to tick only the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.859
 most essential applications 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 just here you really tick the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.520
 applications that serve you and you 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.619
 uncheck others so there for example 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.479
 the location service will work 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.799
 only for syria and for plans 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.290
 and in all other applications 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.880
 it will be disabled so it's a good one 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.890
 compromise between turning it off and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.229
 activated you check only those 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.430
 useful applications that's for the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.600
 first advice I had to you 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.580
 give to save from the battery 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.100
 second thing it's happening in the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.509
 notifications right here there you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.799
 find the list of all 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 applications for which you have 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.220
 the possibility of receiving 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 certain notifications are found in 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.360
 the notification center of others not 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.259
 and there are certain applications for 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.240
 which you do not care 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.799
 totally to receive notifications 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.540
 there for example you see that I 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.280
 disabled banners disable them 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.909
 are disabled the lozenges on 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.829
 application 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.030
 everything was removed simply because 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.770
 that I do not want to receive 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.200
 notifications from this app it does not 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.729
 I'm not interested so also for the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.409
 applications you use the least 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 and disable the most things 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.920
 possible and for others 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.869
 Well, you can activate the center 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 notifications the banners the sounds 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.869
 and all he serves you so does 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.060
 well sorting between applications 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.829
 useful and the others less useful for 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.010
 save again a maximum of 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.630
 drums 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.490
 then there is a second type of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 notification that this time little of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.730
 people know about email 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
 so you go to this section 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.280
 and you will go into new data 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.140
 right here there the push notification you 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.940
 put it aof disable you 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.490
 the display of notification banners 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.960
 for each new mail and then the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.150
 search me I advise you to the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.920
 put in manual like that you avoid that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.140
 the iphone does not search automatically 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.010
 all x times if you have not received 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.710
 new mails 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.270
 the search will be done only when 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.470
 you will open the mail application and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.360
 only in this case 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.670
 so again that allows you to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.840
 save from the battery so here we go 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.040
 still stay a little bit in the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.960
 settings to try to find 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.700
 other little tips that will help us 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.830
 allow to gradually increase 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.240
 the autonomy of the device other months 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.340
 advice I have to give you this 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.090
 going on here in the wifi you go 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.770
 In this section 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.840
 and I just advise you 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.850
 to put the wifi aof when you 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.770
 get out of your home you turn it off 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.450
 so that your iphone can always 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.910
 to be connected to the internet since you 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.500
 have the 3g but he will not look for 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.570
 constantly a relay wifi for himself 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940
 connect and you will save your 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.070
 battery in the same style we have the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.810
 bluetooth my advice it is very simple 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.580
 disable it if you do not use it 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.230
 not and put the man only 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.030
 when you need it 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.190
 if you have a kit or a headset 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.080
 bluetooth and well but such just when 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.519
 it is necessary and if you do not have it well 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.140
 you do not need the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.269
 bluetooth leave it aof 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.610
 we will now go take a look 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.930
 in category b are so there you 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.880
 find all about noises 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.620
 of your device the vibrations the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.090
 ringtones and again in 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.620
 looking good we can find 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.209
 some small details that will help us 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.600
 allow to increase the battery of 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.700
 the device 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.310
 first thing I show you the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.720
 vibrator so in ring mode me I 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.100
 advise you to disable it on 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.690
 vibrator you put it aof 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.580
 since when you're in mode 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.870
 ringtone if your device rings 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.269
 hear it you do not need a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.890
 vibration plus leave the mode 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.140
 vibrate when you're vibrating and 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.959
 in ring mode disable the vibration 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.620
 additional then other tip that 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.150
 I propose you 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.590
 and there we had to really look for 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.930
 find it since it is at the end 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.670
 background of the settings of our device in 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.920
 the settings section you go down you 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.970
 go in accessibility and there you 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.070
 find all options 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.320
 configurable and including one that 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.720
 is called flash led for just warning 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.250
 here that's going to emit a blink 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.630
 with your flash in the back of 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.560
 the device when you receive a 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.230
 notification 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.080
 it can be anything to a sms a 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.060
 reminder an email anything and by 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.650
 default c activated so it really takes 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.389
 go get to find it and so 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.610
 you clear to save another one 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.440
 time of battery then we have syria 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.030
 for those they have it of course so 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.530
 the vocal assistant of apple me I you 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.940
 advise to put it off if you do not 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.650
 you do not use it if you feel that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.840
 siri is not helpful to you 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.400
 do not use regularly that you 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.530
 find you go faster without 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270
 him and well disable him because he 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.030
 he eats a lot of batteries 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.410
 syria then another little thing that I 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.920
 can you show who is always good at 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.540
 know 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.400
 it concerns automatic locking 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.680
 of the device so it's important to 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.810
 well configure it me I place them 6 to 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.730
 3 minutes what you do not need 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.410
 to do it will never do it 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.970
 if you forget your device by 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.560
 example in a place that is not 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.200
 locked and well it will not run 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.580
 never and you will really decrease 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.410
 your battery has a high speed 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.220
 whereas if you have selected three 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.380
 minutes or less 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.790
 well it's okay your device 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.350
 if you forget that lock will go 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.780
 automatically and will save your 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.730
 battery i'll finish with the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.620
 brightness that's also important for 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.510
 the next battery if you are 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.460
 indoors or outdoors if you 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.410
 have a lot of light or think little about 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.540
 to adjust it because that it decreases very 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.370
 quickly the battery so here for all 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.750
 these little tips and little advice that 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.010
 I had to share with you so that your 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.820
 battery hold the longest 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.010
 possible 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.270
 I hope it helped you tell me 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.840
