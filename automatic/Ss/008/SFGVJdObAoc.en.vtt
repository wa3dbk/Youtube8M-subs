00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.990
 you've got to all of them it's all over but today we find ourselves 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.480
 for a little tutorial in which I will show you a site that will help you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.950
 to find out if your computer is powerful enough to run a 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:19.880
 Thu 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.300
 although it would be silly to go shopping in stores 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.160
 and not to be able to play so this site the reference very very useful I you 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.449
 strongly advise 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.439
 so to access this site you realize on google 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.820
 the state must be organized 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.580
 the mix like these 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.300
 here we do not have the right to vote 3w points 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 a highly skinny system as you click on this link 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.320
 you are then redirected to a page 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.510
 that looks like this m a little boiler you hate tenure 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.500
 this is the game you want to test jean-marc it's coming soon enough 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.460
 powerful 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.500
 for tsg for example a decree exists 3 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.620
 still is it's pretty powerful against 6 300 exp this 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.870
 new edition 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.900
 we leave on some golden buttons on this beautiful beach page 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.070
 who tells us the toque this is my death of a bull pass addresses of the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.330
 purse has indeed let go I could not play 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.620
 he knew 132 barnsley information why I can not play them but 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.630
 just too because here is Tuesday's motherboards graphics cards 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.290
 is not powerful enough 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.150
 the general secretary you really have every day in the presence I 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.330
 hit my class 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.350
 we can see that this is my class 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.430
 and we also see if their pc is powerful enough 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 to see with the fact that the party is no problem 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.760
 the government has retained a stent choice to play that the purpose of these 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.990
 abductions the loss of a quarter of an hour 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.720
 and so here is a title of the site 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.280
 pity that this small town in the midst of crisis debate 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.720
 check out this site before buying the game 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 I tell you, do you wear the weather in a hi procedure?
