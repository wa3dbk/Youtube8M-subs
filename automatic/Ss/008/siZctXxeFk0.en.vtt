00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
whole thing is completely ridiculous I

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.949 
whole thing is completely ridiculous I
think<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.150> should<00:02:51.180> actually<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.600> get<00:02:51.750> rid<00:02:51.900> of

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
think we should actually just get rid of

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.240 
think we should actually just get rid of

Terry because he's an awful person it's
quite<00:02:58.050> understandable<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:58.980> makes<00:02:59.100> a

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
quite understandable it just makes a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.260 
quite understandable it just makes a
mockery<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.640> whole<00:02:59.670> system<00:02:59.970> at<00:03:00.209> the

mockery of the whole system at the
handshake<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.110> idea<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.530> sportsmanship

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920

the<00:03:02.610> lineup<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.600> pretty<00:03:03.780> new<00:03:03.930> thing<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
the lineup is it's a pretty new thing to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.050 
the lineup is it's a pretty new thing to
the<00:03:04.470> game<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.130> Premier<00:03:05.430> League<00:03:05.459> anyway<00:03:05.820> I

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
the game in the Premier League anyway I

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.490 
the game in the Premier League anyway I
think<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.450> needs<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.320> shake

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
think it needs to go that you just shake

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.080 
think it needs to go that you just shake
hands<00:03:07.680> afterwards<00:03:08.070> idealistic<00:03:08.459> no<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> agree

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
hands afterwards idealistic no I agree

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.490 
hands afterwards idealistic no I agree
with<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> sportsmanship<00:03:09.959> angle<00:03:10.380> but

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
with you the sportsmanship angle but

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.750 
with you the sportsmanship angle but
it's<00:03:10.709> been<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> tradition<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.459> spin<00:03:11.670> around

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
it's been a tradition and spin around

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.040 
it's been a tradition and spin around
for<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> while<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.420> doubt<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> go

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
for a while so I doubt it's going to go

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.990 
for a while so I doubt it's going to go
away<00:03:13.410> anytime<00:03:13.560> soon<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.340> know<00:03:14.430> set<00:03:14.730> bladder
