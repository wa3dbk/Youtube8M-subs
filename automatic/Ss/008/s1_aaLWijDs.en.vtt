00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.489
 you know welcome to this first tutorial our team we're going 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.009
 talk about painting 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.889
 essential steps for well sprayed get a good result 

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.609
 but in vain 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.480
 we start by dropping a few drops of 18 years to see here from 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.130
 ethyl alcohol 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.249
 yet on the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.380
 to avoid that the painting does not go back 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.970
 and then we put a few drops of paint on the bottom of the side 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.040
 that's like this one and then starts again on a report 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.600
 decrease of 2 50% of paint they were 50% from 18 hours 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.090
 of course I advise you to start with painting de gaulle 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.790
 team 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.810
 very easy to apply their program it is very tolerant 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.110
 with the different criteria of 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.640
 of dilution rather than the paintings and moral or the mms in general which is 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 are significantly more difficult 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.649
 eighteen girls and find the right report 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.900
 jean tura 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.770
 so for 100 pupils paintings of the museum 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.650
 failing to finish it at mellac amiable especially with the maternity paintings 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.640
 so obviously obvious 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.970
 a18 komilfo so as you see there 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.530
 I put the important painting well adding constantly 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.490
 Thursday during small drops to drip to good 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.260
 good but gerets 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.950
 the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.100
 that's the question that some on the sides side of the side 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.869
 aspects of painting then a fool that the usual find all 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.550
 immediately following 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.140
 the defeat in voice of the rent of a big sick body how the painting of 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.620
 flow on the edge of the bucket 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.300
 but we immediately see a series of holes 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.800
 basescu is diluted but hey that's okay it comes with the experience at first there 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.660
 will have to do spray tests 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.530
 how much he found the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 the report to the discussions for painting 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.039
 here in my heart we continue to make sure of the sustainability 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.519
 is not obvious from the back of voice and video 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.019
 that's it, then we'll start gently spraying ourselves when we 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.059
 starts with a little reason precisely veils of paint I try not to 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.239
 not adopt approaching too close 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 and one more after the gas is too much grazing 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.409
 plus the benefits of killer mothers to be well aware 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:45.079
 hard 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.229
 painting rendering 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:51.209
 then you have to use the capacity that does not have no absorbent products 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.789
 like glossy cardboard are there the paint is absorbed by the by 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:01.319
 the support and we will have a bad bad judgment then on the on the 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.269
 plastic piece obama which is a 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.659
 durand director of painting 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.349
 so I use hagemann against the light% to see well the 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 made the painting is not obvious on the video 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.439
 to show so there I try to show you will talk again 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.009
 by brian however for lighting not very visible the sea in the 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.189
 reality you're backlighting no window and a purpose and 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.979
 harassing he is immediately see 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.069
 if your painting 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.579
 ready to dilute in the club too diluted is registering the back 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.569
 howard who will find very bad of the single piece 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.260
 and not enough of the vehicle 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.539
 we raised up and spit it out tools needed for a very tight vote 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 or rather it says nothing 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:49.459
 the granule 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.459
 it is clear that genk search 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.819
 in the club we simply went for the tutorial point e 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.700
 a painting of 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.259
 two cans 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.109
 of fantasies 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.419
 so we do not get too much spraying 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.849
 lilou cement 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.009
 but ended up completely covering cans 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.469
 while constantly watching 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.590
 from the amount of colombian paint they said since we sprayed in this 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.079
 time 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 on the piece 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 victoria this system that can help you 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.590
 he hopes to find soon on tf1 the opposing team
