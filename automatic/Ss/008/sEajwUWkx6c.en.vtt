review<00:00:38.610> sample<00:00:38.850> provided<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.629> us<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.020> just

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
review sample provided to us I just

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
review sample provided to us I just
forked<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> money<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.670> okay<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
forked over the money I'm like okay I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330 
forked over the money I'm like okay I
got<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.350> action<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.190> their

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
got to see this in action so their

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.080 
got to see this in action so their
tagline<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.360> fast<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:46.260> focus<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
tagline is be fast be focus and the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.810 
tagline is be fast be focus and the
implication<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.610> will

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
implication of that is that this will

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.330 
implication of that is that this will
make<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.180> faster<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.750> more<00:00:52.379> focus<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.010> uses<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
make you faster and more focus it uses a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.959 
make you faster and more focus it uses a
technology<00:00:54.270> called<00:00:54.770> tDCS<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:56.219> transcranial

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
technology called tDCS or transcranial

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
technology called tDCS or transcranial
direct<00:00:57.390> current<00:00:57.660> stimulation<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.920> while

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
direct current stimulation so while

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.330 
direct current stimulation so while
there<00:00:59.280> may<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.430> evidence<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.379> tDCS<00:01:01.379> does<00:01:01.980> do

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
there may be evidence that tDCS does do

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 
there may be evidence that tDCS does do
something<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.120> usually<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> clinical

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
something it's usually in a clinical

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
setting and it's usually with much

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
setting and it's usually with much
different<00:01:07.229> equipment<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> first

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

default mode that the focus runs in but
if

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
if

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
if
you<00:02:13.770> get<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.190> accessory<00:02:15.000> pack<00:02:15.240> or<00:02:15.510> extras

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
you get the accessory pack or extras

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.900 
you get the accessory pack or extras
pack<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.500> whatever<00:02:16.770> else<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.190> called<00:02:17.430> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
pack or whatever else it's called you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190 
pack or whatever else it's called you
get<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> few<00:02:18.420> different<00:02:18.780> things<00:02:18.960> including

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
get a few different things including

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.950 
get a few different things including
some<00:02:19.950> different<00:02:20.580> modes<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.510> sinus

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
some different modes so you get sinus

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.910 
some different modes so you get sinus
pulse<00:02:22.530> nose<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.790> sham<00:02:24.360> mode<00:02:24.690> sham<00:02:25.380> mode<00:02:25.680> is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
pulse nose and sham mode sham mode is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.740 
pulse nose and sham mode sham mode is
exactly<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.940> sounds<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.390> it's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
exactly what it sounds like it's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.390 
exactly what it sounds like it's
actually<00:02:28.170> faking<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.280> do

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
actually faking it so that you can do

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.940 
actually faking it so that you can do
blind<00:02:29.700> tests<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.410> figure<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.710> if

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
blind tests and so you can figure out if

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.890 
blind tests and so you can figure out if
it<00:02:32.040> actually<00:02:32.220> has<00:02:32.550> any<00:02:32.670> effect<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.420> includes<00:02:33.780> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it actually has any effect it includes a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.810 
it actually has any effect it includes a
bunch<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.230> extra<00:02:34.650> sponges<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.490> those<00:02:35.640> are

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
bunch of extra sponges so those are

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.990 
bunch of extra sponges so those are
dampening<00:02:36.270> sponges<00:02:37.460> includes<00:02:38.460> whatever

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
dampening sponges includes whatever

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.810 
dampening sponges includes whatever
these<00:02:39.570> are<00:02:39.630> some<00:02:40.110> more<00:02:40.230> pads<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.950> things<00:02:41.220> more

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
these are some more pads for things more

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.840 
these are some more pads for things more
wires<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.990> doodads<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.710> extra<00:02:44.400> right<00:02:44.640> these

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
wires and doodads I extra right these

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.900 
wires and doodads I extra right these
are<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> external<00:02:45.420> pads<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.340> external<00:02:47.340> leads

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
are the external pads and external leads

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.640 
are the external pads and external leads
so<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.690> actually<00:02:49.020> hook<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.440> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
so you can actually hook them up a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.480 
so you can actually hook them up a
little<00:02:49.890> bit<00:02:50.010> differently

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
little bit differently

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.540 
little bit differently
alright<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.270> got<00:02:51.300> more<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.410> those<00:02:52.830> again

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
alright we got more of those again

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.070 
alright we got more of those again
another<00:02:54.330> little<00:02:54.780> carrying<00:02:55.320> case<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:56.100> well<00:02:56.460> as

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
another little carrying case as well as

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.670 
another little carrying case as well as
evidently<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.410> stand<00:02:59.510> for<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.570> focus<00:03:00.900> all

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
evidently a stand for the focus all

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220 
evidently a stand for the focus all
right<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.580> there's<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.300> extras<00:03:03.660> pack<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:04.110> any

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
right so there's the extras pack at any

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.720 
right so there's the extras pack at any
rate<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:04.740> mostly<00:03:05.070> interested<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.610> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
rate I was mostly interested in the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.310 
rate I was mostly interested in the
additional<00:03:06.150> modes<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.690> some<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.110> modes

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
additional modes and some of the modes

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.930 
additional modes and some of the modes
that<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.680> enables<00:03:08.070> I've<00:03:08.250> been<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.640> bit

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that it enables I've been a little bit

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.930 
that it enables I've been a little bit
better<00:03:09.480> investigated<00:03:10.350> there's<00:03:11.220> an<00:03:11.370> app<00:03:11.610> that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
better investigated there's an app that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.220 
better investigated there's an app that
allows<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.360> control<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:12.990> can<00:03:13.200> use

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
allows you to control it so you can use

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.810 
allows you to control it so you can use
the<00:03:13.530> touch<00:03:13.680> sensitive<00:03:13.980> controls<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.700> the

android and there will be Windows Mac
and<00:03:27.780> Linux<00:03:27.840> ones<00:03:28.560> as<00:03:28.800> well<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.180> let's<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
and Linux ones as well so let's have a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.020 
and Linux ones as well so let's have a
look<00:03:30.780> at<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.380> okay<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.860> guess<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.130> inside<00:03:32.820> here

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
look at the okay I guess so inside here

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.090 
look at the okay I guess so inside here
you<00:03:33.150> get<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.360> little<00:03:33.630> bottle<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.680> dampening

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you get a little bottle for dampening

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.520 
you get a little bottle for dampening
your<00:03:35.370> sponges<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.390> also<00:03:36.990> get<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> charging

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
your sponges you also get a charging

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.160 
your sponges you also get a charging
cable<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.670> uses<00:03:39.030> micro<00:03:39.360> USB<00:03:39.810> because

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
cable it uses micro USB because

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.840 
cable it uses micro USB because
everything<00:03:40.830> does<00:03:41.010> these<00:03:41.220> days<00:03:41.250> even<00:03:41.700> though

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
everything does these days even though
