today<00:00:14.510> we'd<00:00:14.719> like<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:14.900> share<00:00:15.260> with<00:00:15.320> you<00:00:15.559> a

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
today we'd like to share with you a

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.920 
today we'd like to share with you a
little<00:00:15.740> bit<00:00:15.980> about<00:00:16.250> high<00:00:17.029> kernel<00:00:17.360> high<00:00:17.630> tunnel

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
little bit about high kernel high tunnel

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.440 
little bit about high kernel high tunnel
construction<00:00:18.470> in<00:00:18.590> Nebraska<00:00:19.160> high<00:00:20.060> tunnels

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
construction in Nebraska high tunnels

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.269 
construction in Nebraska high tunnels
are<00:00:20.599> essentially<00:00:21.259> an<00:00:21.500> unheated<00:00:21.980> greenhouse

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
are essentially an unheated greenhouse

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.089 
are essentially an unheated greenhouse
and<00:00:22.930> people<00:00:23.930> are<00:00:24.050> starting<00:00:24.439> to<00:00:24.560> use<00:00:24.740> them<00:00:24.919> now

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
and people are starting to use them now

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.889 
and people are starting to use them now
they<00:00:25.880> use<00:00:26.059> them<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:26.360> extend<00:00:26.660> their<00:00:26.779> growing

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
they use them to extend their growing

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.319 
they use them to extend their growing
season<00:00:27.230> especially<00:00:28.130> now<00:00:28.669> that<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:29.059> price<00:00:29.270> of

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
season especially now that the price of

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.389 
season especially now that the price of
vegetables<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:30.230> flowers<00:00:30.680> are<00:00:30.890> in<00:00:31.219> the

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
vegetables and flowers are in the

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.819 
vegetables and flowers are in the
increase<00:00:32.149> we<00:00:32.329> see<00:00:32.360> more<00:00:32.719> people<00:00:32.870> growing

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
increase we see more people growing

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.369 
increase we see more people growing
plants<00:00:34.219> in<00:00:34.340> high<00:00:34.489> tunnels<00:00:35.149> but<00:00:35.329> behind<00:00:35.960> me<00:00:36.200> is

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
plants in high tunnels but behind me is

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.250 
plants in high tunnels but behind me is
an<00:00:36.770> example<00:00:37.160> of<00:00:37.489> one<00:00:38.000> type<00:00:38.270> of<00:00:38.300> high<00:00:38.840> tunnel

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
an example of one type of high tunnel

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.710 
an example of one type of high tunnel
but<00:00:39.649> again<00:00:40.219> a<00:00:40.250> high<00:00:40.850> tunnel<00:00:41.090> can<00:00:41.329> look<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.570> lot

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
but again a high tunnel can look a lot

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.450 
but again a high tunnel can look a lot
like<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.930> greenhouse<00:00:42.440> but<00:00:43.040> there's<00:00:43.310> no

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
like a greenhouse but there's no

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.270 
like a greenhouse but there's no
supplemental<00:00:44.120> heat<00:00:44.930> in<00:00:45.079> it<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.920> one<00:00:46.100> we

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
supplemental heat in it so the one we

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.520 
supplemental heat in it so the one we
have<00:00:46.490> here<00:00:46.910> actually<00:00:47.329> has<00:00:47.750> more<00:00:47.960> permanent

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
have here actually has more permanent

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.020 
have here actually has more permanent
sides<00:00:48.770> it's<00:00:49.070> more<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.460> permanent<00:00:49.700> high

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
sides it's more of a permanent high

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.520 
sides it's more of a permanent high
tunnel<00:00:50.390> but<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:50.660> can<00:00:50.780> also<00:00:50.930> have<00:00:51.230> high

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
tunnel but you can also have high

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.360 
tunnel but you can also have high
tunnels<00:00:52.300> which<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.630> movable<00:00:54.260> as<00:00:54.470> well<00:00:54.950> they

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
tunnels which are movable as well they

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.490 
tunnels which are movable as well they
can<00:00:55.550> move<00:00:55.670> from<00:00:55.880> one<00:00:55.970> site<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.780> another<00:00:56.960> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
can move from one site to another and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.150 
can move from one site to another and
actually<00:00:58.280> they're<00:00:58.460> all<00:00:58.610> poly<00:00:59.739> this<00:01:00.739> is<00:01:00.950> sort

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
actually they're all poly this is sort

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.010 
actually they're all poly this is sort
of<00:01:01.220> an<00:01:01.340> experiment<00:01:01.940> for<00:01:02.180> us<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.540> year<00:01:02.780> we're

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
of an experiment for us this year we're

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.620 
of an experiment for us this year we're
getting<00:01:03.170> used<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.649> it<00:01:03.860> figuring<00:01:04.820> out<00:01:05.329> how<00:01:05.600> it

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
getting used to it figuring out how it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.380 
getting used to it figuring out how it
works<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.860> found<00:01:07.130> out<00:01:07.340> right<00:01:07.579> away<00:01:07.759> that<00:01:08.180> one

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
works we found out right away that one

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.149 
works we found out right away that one
of<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.600> challenges<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.350> have<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:09.770> putting<00:01:10.070> it

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
of the challenges we have in putting it

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.090 
of the challenges we have in putting it
up<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.060> wind<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:11.990> when<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.710> get<00:01:12.860> very

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
up is the wind and when you get very

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.780 
up is the wind and when you get very
windy<00:01:13.549> days<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.090> you're<00:01:14.210> trying<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.510> put<00:01:14.780> a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
windy days and you're trying to put a

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.030 
windy days and you're trying to put a
poly<00:01:16.790> cover<00:01:17.150> on<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.659> then<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.620> gets<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.920> be

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
poly cover on this then it gets to be

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.219 
poly cover on this then it gets to be
real<00:01:19.370> much<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.909> challenge<00:01:20.150> also<00:01:20.750> we've<00:01:21.200> been

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
real much of a challenge also we've been

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.010 
real much of a challenge also we've been
using<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:22.659> fabric<00:01:23.860> for<00:01:24.860> weed<00:01:25.670> control<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.479> we

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
using a fabric for weed control and we

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.810 
using a fabric for weed control and we
found<00:01:27.170> out<00:01:27.409> on<00:01:27.560> those<00:01:27.710> very<00:01:28.010> windy<00:01:28.400> days<00:01:28.580> we

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
found out on those very windy days we

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.149 
found out on those very windy days we
had<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:28.970> few<00:01:29.240> weeks<00:01:29.420> ago<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.770> fabric

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
had a few weeks ago that the fabric

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.740 
had a few weeks ago that the fabric
didn't<00:01:31.369> want<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.610> stay<00:01:31.760> down<00:01:31.970> very<00:01:32.270> well<00:01:32.510> and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
didn't want to stay down very well and

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.120 
didn't want to stay down very well and
we<00:01:32.869> even<00:01:33.020> have<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:33.380> clipped<00:01:33.950> down

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
we even have it clipped down

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.980 
we even have it clipped down
so<00:01:34.700> but<00:01:34.970> anyway<00:01:35.000> but<00:01:35.450> there's<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.690> lot<00:01:35.869> of

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so but anyway but there's a lot of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.020 
so but anyway but there's a lot of
potentials<00:01:36.470> for<00:01:36.619> using<00:01:36.950> high<00:01:37.100> tunnels<00:01:37.520> but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
potentials for using high tunnels but

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.280 
potentials for using high tunnels but
what<00:01:38.180> we're<00:01:38.330> trying<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.720> do<00:01:38.840> here<00:01:39.080> we're

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
what we're trying to do here we're

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.080 
what we're trying to do here we're
trying<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.619> look<00:01:39.740> at<00:01:39.890> two<00:01:40.310> different<00:01:40.340> types<00:01:40.700> of

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
trying to look at two different types of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.550 
trying to look at two different types of
crops<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.689> high<00:01:41.810> tunnel<00:01:42.020> one<00:01:42.350> we're

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
crops in the high tunnel one we're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.170 
crops in the high tunnel one we're
looking<00:01:43.040> at<00:01:43.189> vegetables<00:01:43.760> we're<00:01:43.970> very

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
looking at vegetables we're very

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.149 
looking at vegetables we're very
interested<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.780> tomatoes<00:01:45.619> peppers<00:01:45.950> and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
interested in tomatoes peppers and

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.300 
interested in tomatoes peppers and
cucumbers<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:47.479> see<00:01:47.689> how<00:01:47.900> they<00:01:48.170> grow<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:49.130> the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
cucumbers to see how they grow in the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.490 
cucumbers to see how they grow in the
high<00:01:49.460> tunnel<00:01:49.520> again<00:01:50.180> we're<00:01:50.570> trying<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.080> look

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
high tunnel again we're trying to look

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.289 
high tunnel again we're trying to look
at<00:01:51.680> early<00:01:52.009> production<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:53.000> we're<00:01:53.150> also

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
at early production but we're also

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.560 
at early production but we're also
interested<00:01:53.689> in<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.200> late<00:01:54.380> production<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.909> the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
interested in the late production in the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.260 
interested in the late production in the
in<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.259> year<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.979> other<00:01:58.189> crop<00:01:58.520> type<00:01:58.939> of<00:01:59.090> crop

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
in the year the other crop type of crop

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.929 
in the year the other crop type of crop
were<00:01:59.420> looking<00:01:59.750> at<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.229> cut<00:02:00.650> flowers<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.310> so

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
were looking at is cut flowers and so

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.760 
were looking at is cut flowers and so
we're<00:02:02.119> looking<00:02:02.240> at<00:02:02.540> things<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:02.840> sunflowers

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
we're looking at things like sunflowers

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.569 
we're looking at things like sunflowers
zinnias<00:02:05.229> snapdragons<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.680> see<00:02:06.890> how<00:02:07.130> they<00:02:07.369> will

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
zinnias snapdragons to see how they will

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.210 
zinnias snapdragons to see how they will
perform<00:02:07.850> in<00:02:08.299> here<00:02:08.679> there<00:02:09.679> are<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.829> couple<00:02:10.009> other

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
perform in here there are a couple other

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.190 
perform in here there are a couple other
crops<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:11.030> are<00:02:11.180> going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.659> very<00:02:11.900> minor

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
crops that are going to be very minor

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.289 
crops that are going to be very minor
crops<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.799> here<00:02:13.010> one<00:02:13.489> we're<00:02:13.730> looking<00:02:14.000> at<00:02:14.120> some

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
crops in here one we're looking at some

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.030 
crops in here one we're looking at some
of<00:02:14.420> our<00:02:14.510> penstemon<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.349> see<00:02:15.530> how<00:02:15.650> they<00:02:15.829> might

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
of our penstemon to see how they might

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.210 
of our penstemon to see how they might
react<00:02:16.879> as<00:02:17.120> sunflowers<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:18.230> excuse<00:02:18.650> me<00:02:18.770> as<00:02:18.920> cut

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
react as sunflowers or excuse me as cut

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.540 
react as sunflowers or excuse me as cut
flowers<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.989> other<00:02:21.170> crop<00:02:21.530> were

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
flowers and then the other crop were

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
flowers and then the other crop were
doing<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.760> little<00:02:22.940> bit<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> experimentation<00:02:23.630> on

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
doing a little bit of experimentation on

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.950 
doing a little bit of experimentation on
our<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:25.220> asparagus<00:02:25.820> we're<00:02:26.480> not<00:02:26.600> sure<00:02:26.780> how

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
our is asparagus we're not sure how

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.450 
our is asparagus we're not sure how
that'll<00:02:27.320> do<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> high<00:02:27.800> tunnel<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.340> we

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
that'll do in the high tunnel but we

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.290 
that'll do in the high tunnel but we
thought<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.670> would<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:28.910> an<00:02:29.120> interesting

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
thought it would be an interesting

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.340 
thought it would be an interesting
concept<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> try<00:02:30.470> now<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.960> project<00:02:32.960> is

and putting this height on a lot but we

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.060 
and putting this height on a lot but we
do<00:02:44.420> feel<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.720> there's<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.200> lot<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.560> potential

there<00:02:46.100> for<00:02:46.520> doing<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.690> there's<00:02:48.620> going

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
there for doing this and there's going

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.460 
there for doing this and there's going
to<00:02:48.830> be<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.980> lot<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.160> potential<00:02:49.700> across<00:02:50.470> Nebraska

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.010 
to be a lot of potential across Nebraska
for<00:02:51.980> growing<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.370> variety<00:02:52.520> crops<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.690> in

the high tunnel and high tunnel concept

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.940 
the high tunnel and high tunnel concept
actually<00:02:56.660> high<00:02:57.020> tunnels<00:02:57.410> get<00:02:57.590> their<00:02:57.740> name

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
actually high tunnels get their name

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.820 
actually high tunnels get their name
because<00:02:59.020> previously<00:03:00.020> people<00:03:00.200> use<00:03:00.530> what<00:03:00.710> we

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
because previously people use what we

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.230 
because previously people use what we
call<00:03:01.010> low<00:03:01.220> tunnels<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.790> there<00:03:01.940> were<00:03:02.030> little

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
call low tunnels and there were little

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.270 
call low tunnels and there were little
small<00:03:02.510> tunnels<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.470> could<00:03:03.680> put<00:03:04.040> over

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
small tunnels that you could put over

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.980 
small tunnels that you could put over
like<00:03:04.430> tomato<00:03:04.790> plants<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.390> protect<00:03:05.540> them<00:03:05.870> in

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
like tomato plants to protect them in

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.050 
like tomato plants to protect them in
the<00:03:06.020> spring<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.590> sometimes<00:03:07.280> those<00:03:07.550> were<00:03:07.760> only

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the spring and sometimes those were only

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.620 
the spring and sometimes those were only
one<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.110> two<00:03:09.140> feet<00:03:09.500> tall<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:10.210> so<00:03:11.210> those<00:03:11.480> would

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
one or two feet tall and so those would

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.420 
one or two feet tall and so those would
be<00:03:11.780> more<00:03:11.930> like<00:03:12.140> low<00:03:12.380> tunnels<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.280> now

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
be more like low tunnels and then now

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.130 
be more like low tunnels and then now
we've<00:03:13.640> gone<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.940> high<00:03:14.090> tunnels<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.690> there's

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
we've gone to high tunnels and there's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.320 
we've gone to high tunnels and there's
enough<00:03:15.380> information<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:16.130> there<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.550> you

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
enough information out there that you

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.000 
enough information out there that you
have<00:03:17.360> people<00:03:17.750> growing<00:03:17.960> vegetables<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.860> have

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
have people growing vegetables you have

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.350 
have people growing vegetables you have
them<00:03:19.130> growing<00:03:19.340> raspberries<00:03:20.210> strawberries

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
them growing raspberries strawberries

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.010 
them growing raspberries strawberries
and<00:03:21.110> high<00:03:21.260> tunnels<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:22.130> also<00:03:22.690> have<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> few

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
and high tunnels you also have a few

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.590 
and high tunnels you also have a few
people<00:03:24.320> trying<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.680> grow<00:03:25.610> door<00:03:26.060> fruit<00:03:26.360> trees

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
people trying to grow door fruit trees

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.750 
people trying to grow door fruit trees
in<00:03:27.440> high<00:03:27.620> tunnels<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.070> there's<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.340> lot<00:03:28.730> of

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
in high tunnels so there's a lot of

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.090 
in high tunnels so there's a lot of
opportunities<00:03:29.510> there<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:30.050> might<00:03:30.770> also<00:03:30.950> mention

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
opportunities there I might also mention

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.910 
opportunities there I might also mention
too<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.670> on<00:03:32.570> our<00:03:32.750> irrigation<00:03:33.050> system<00:03:33.380> here

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
too that on our irrigation system here

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.490 
too that on our irrigation system here
we'll<00:03:34.880> be<00:03:35.000> using<00:03:35.180> drip<00:03:35.510> irrigation<00:03:35.959> system

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
we'll be using drip irrigation system

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.400 
we'll be using drip irrigation system
and<00:03:36.650> there's<00:03:36.920> different<00:03:37.340> types<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:38.410> tubing

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
and there's different types of tubing

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.500 
and there's different types of tubing
that<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.920> use<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.370> can<00:03:40.520> use<00:03:40.550> use<00:03:41.150> hose

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
that you can use you can use use hose

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.540 
that you can use you can use use hose
you<00:03:41.810> can<00:03:41.840> use<00:03:42.080> sprinkler<00:03:42.560> hose<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:43.220> can<00:03:43.370> also

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
you can use sprinkler hose you can also

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.940 
you can use sprinkler hose you can also
use<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.060> drip<00:03:44.239> line<00:03:44.270> which<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.080> here<00:03:45.860> in

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
use the drip line which I have here in

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.190 
use the drip line which I have here in
my<00:03:45.980> hand<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.580> this<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.209> type<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.900> tubing

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
my hand and this is a type of tubing

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.350 
my hand and this is a type of tubing
that<00:03:48.260> we're<00:03:48.500> going<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.739> be<00:03:48.950> doing<00:03:49.430> down<00:03:49.700> one<00:03:50.239> of

help out the other thing is heat control
in<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.010> spring<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.520> fall<00:04:01.820> if<00:04:02.600> this<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:02.989> all

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
in the spring in the fall if this is all

in the spring in the fall if this is all
closed<00:04:03.500> up<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.860> builds<00:04:04.160> up<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.370> lot<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.670> heat<00:04:04.820> in

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
closed up it builds up a lot of heat in
