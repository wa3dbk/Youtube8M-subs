00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 good hello to everyone I am always known e 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.110
 welcome back to prince of persia then 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.100
 then we had arrived at 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:24.060
 courtyard and we must try to return 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 in the large room of the fountain of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.980
 cyanide and now explain to me if it wasn't there 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.399
 a hole the usefulness of this trap is 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.710
 the web can never do it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.379
 does nothing does nothing does nothing we like 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:47.840
 even so dying every now and then wasting 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:53.809
 so many sands randomly well then 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:59.460
 thus they activate the great Guala traps 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:03.079
 guala step is also normally that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.079
 that you see the art and the pope 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670
 hello para 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:24.319
 which then endlessly arrows that clearly 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:28.850
 who manages from over cha opaque and then it is 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.450
 everything goes well for now the problem of 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.689
 this game 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.030
 ok is that this one needs help 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.250
 for N 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.750
 that is, if she dies, game ends and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.750
 I think it's great 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.300
 that sucks 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:56.690

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.230

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.019

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.540
 personal thing and what you want
