523<00:05:10.510> under<00:05:11.350> 523<00:05:11.889> and<00:05:12.190> we<00:05:12.370> would<00:05:12.490> have<00:05:12.580> made<00:05:12.700> it

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
523 under 523 and we would have made it

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.340 
523 under 523 and we would have made it
if<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.060> wasn't<00:05:13.210> for<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.480> chimney<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:14.139> we

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
if it wasn't for the chimney and we

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.409 
if it wasn't for the chimney and we
could<00:05:14.500> have<00:05:14.590> just<00:05:14.710> lowered<00:05:14.950> our<00:05:18.150> little<00:05:19.150> flag

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
could have just lowered our little flag

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.590 
could have just lowered our little flag
mass<00:05:19.919> but<00:05:20.919> I<00:05:21.520> didn't<00:05:22.000> feel<00:05:22.090> like<00:05:22.240> taking<00:05:22.540> the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
mass but I didn't feel like taking the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600 
mass but I didn't feel like taking the
chimney<00:05:22.930> out<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.950> we're<00:05:24.070> just<00:05:24.100> doing<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.430> bit<00:05:24.580> of
