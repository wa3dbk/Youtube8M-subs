00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
I like it a lot it was a lot of fun to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.950 
I like it a lot it was a lot of fun to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
build

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.720 
build
I<00:02:24.990> made<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> little<00:02:25.410> faster<00:02:26.010> than<00:02:26.190> they

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
I made it a little faster than they

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.130 
I made it a little faster than they
usually<00:02:26.910> take<00:02:27.210> me<00:02:27.360> because<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.690> didn't<00:02:27.990> bother

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
usually take me because I didn't bother

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.660 
usually take me because I didn't bother
putting<00:02:28.350> any<00:02:28.560> grease<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.040> love<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.460> color

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
putting any grease I love the color

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640 
putting any grease I love the color

GOL<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> wheels<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.730> only<00:02:32.940> problem<00:02:33.360> with

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
GOL in the wheels the only problem with

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.180 
GOL in the wheels the only problem with
it<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.840> they've<00:02:34.170> used<00:02:34.380> some<00:02:34.590> kind<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.890> just

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it is they've used some kind of just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.880 
it is they've used some kind of just
gold<00:02:35.490> covering<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.780> type<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.110> regular<00:02:37.500> plastic

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
gold covering or type of regular plastic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.730 
gold covering or type of regular plastic
and<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.790> stuff<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.210> just<00:02:39.240> peeling<00:02:40.080> right<00:02:40.470> off

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
and the stuff is just peeling right off

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.440 
and the stuff is just peeling right off
every<00:02:41.160> place<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:41.550> cut<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.940> when<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.300> was

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
every place as I cut it when I was

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.240 
every place as I cut it when I was
handling<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.960> cutting<00:02:43.260> off<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.590> wheels<00:02:43.770> it

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
handling it cutting off the wheels it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.120 
handling it cutting off the wheels it
was<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.550> coming<00:02:44.820> off<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.330> sheets<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.800> wheels

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
was just coming off in sheets the wheels

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.680 
was just coming off in sheets the wheels
themselves<00:02:47.400> look<00:02:47.850> okay<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.360> think<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.630> you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
themselves look okay but I think if you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.660 
themselves look okay but I think if you
actually<00:02:48.870> use<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.380> race<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:50.310> wouldn't

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
actually use this to race they wouldn't

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.980 
actually use this to race they wouldn't
stay<00:02:50.820> gold<00:02:51.060> very<00:02:51.240> long<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.720> probably<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
stay gold very long so it's probably a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.180 
stay gold very long so it's probably a
good<00:02:52.110> thing<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.350> I'm<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.830> playing<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
good thing that I'm not playing to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.460 
good thing that I'm not playing to
actually<00:02:53.670> race<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.660> just<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.110> having<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
actually race this I just like having it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.870 
actually race this I just like having it
the<00:02:55.680> only<00:02:55.980> problem<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.460> gotta<00:02:56.640> get<00:02:56.790> this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the only problem is I gotta get this

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.570 
the only problem is I gotta get this
gold<00:02:57.240> off<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.810> tires<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.500> or<00:02:58.950> sticking

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
gold off of the tires now or sticking

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.980 
gold off of the tires now or sticking
everything<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.180> think<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.510> makes<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.810> great

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
everything I think this makes a great

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.560 
everything I think this makes a great
little<00:03:01.380> companion<00:03:01.830> car<00:03:02.100> too<00:03:02.370> Kumal<00:03:03.120> it's<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
little companion car too Kumal it's the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.780 
little companion car too Kumal it's the
same<00:03:03.780> kind<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.080> chassis<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.650> super<00:03:04.950> -<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.550> if

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
same kind of chassis as super - but if

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
same kind of chassis as super - but if
the<00:03:05.940> body<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.420> not<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.170> identical<00:03:07.830> as<00:03:08.040> I

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the body is not as identical as I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.260 
the body is not as identical as I
thought<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.400> was<00:03:08.490> when<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.730> take<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> good<00:03:09.090> look

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
thought it was when you take a good look

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.760 
thought it was when you take a good look
at<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.480> actually<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:09.990> only<00:03:10.080> taking<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.440> cursory

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
at it actually I'm only taking a cursory

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.320 
at it actually I'm only taking a cursory
look<00:03:10.800> before<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.340> thought<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.670> was<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> same

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
look before so I thought it was the same

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.040 
look before so I thought it was the same
but<00:03:12.480> they're<00:03:12.600> actually<00:03:12.690> quite<00:03:12.870> different

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
but they're actually quite different

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.860 
but they're actually quite different
there's<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.800> shocks<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.610> spoiler<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.600> body

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
there's the shocks the spoiler the body

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.750 
there's the shocks the spoiler the body
lines<00:03:16.170> they<00:03:16.590> are<00:03:16.770> similar<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.550> they're

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
lines they are similar because they're

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.850 
lines they are similar because they're
both<00:03:17.820> formula<00:03:18.360> 1h<00:03:18.750> cars<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:19.410> they<00:03:19.560> do<00:03:19.620> have

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
both formula 1h cars but they do have

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.190 
both formula 1h cars but they do have
unique<00:03:20.280> styles<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.570> think<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.870> go<00:03:21.990> great

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
unique styles and I think they go great

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.870 
unique styles and I think they go great
together<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.770> was<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> lot<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.280> fun<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.700> only

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
together that was a lot of fun the only

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.860 
together that was a lot of fun the only
thing<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.030> did<00:03:24.209> find<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.660> have<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.810> be

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
thing I did find is you have to be

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.930 
thing I did find is you have to be
really<00:03:25.470> careful<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.130> intake<00:03:26.550> piece<00:03:26.790> I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
really careful with this intake piece I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.610 
really careful with this intake piece I
actually<00:03:27.270> snapped<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.990> but<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.380> it's

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
actually snapped it but because it's

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.470 
actually snapped it but because it's
resting<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.459> rest<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.760> body<00:03:29.970> it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
resting on the rest of the body it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.970 
resting on the rest of the body it
doesn't<00:03:30.780> matter<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:31.140> carefully<00:03:31.560> put<00:03:31.890> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
doesn't matter and just carefully put it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.290 
doesn't matter and just carefully put it
back<00:03:32.100> together<00:03:32.280> didn't<00:03:32.850> glued<00:03:33.060> or<00:03:33.180> anything

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
back together didn't glued or anything

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.090 
back together didn't glued or anything
you<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.450> put<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:33.990> and<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.770> sits<00:03:34.980> there

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you just put it on and it sits there

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.410 
you just put it on and it sits there
fine<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.490> can't<00:03:35.700> even<00:03:35.910> see<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.270> unless<00:03:36.360> you

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
fine you can't even see it unless you

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.120 
fine you can't even see it unless you
know<00:03:36.750> where<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.170> look<00:03:37.200> for<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.800> that's<00:03:37.980> not

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
know where to look for it so that's not

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.470 
know where to look for it so that's not
to<00:03:38.220> be<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> problem<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.790> definitely<00:03:38.970> come<00:03:39.360> to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
to be a problem I definitely come to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.720 
to be a problem I definitely come to
prefer<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.350> AR<00:03:40.650> chassis<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.280> lot<00:03:41.490> more

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
prefer the the AR chassis a lot more

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.940
