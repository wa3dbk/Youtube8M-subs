00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.009 

I<00:03:42.730> got<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> couple<00:03:44.030> nice<00:03:44.299> kills<00:03:44.569> there<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.959> I

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
I got a couple nice kills there and I

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.720 
I got a couple nice kills there and I
managed<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.349> control<00:03:45.680> both<00:03:45.980> ovies<00:03:46.459> and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
managed to control both ovies and

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.300 
managed to control both ovies and
rockets<00:03:47.329> so<00:03:47.930> that<00:03:48.079> would<00:03:48.200> be<00:03:48.230> huge<00:03:48.709> advantage

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
rockets so that would be huge advantage

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.940 
rockets so that would be huge advantage
for<00:03:49.340> me<00:03:49.640> when<00:03:50.359> you<00:03:50.780> know<00:03:50.900> three<00:03:51.439> minutes<00:03:51.769> pass

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
by or two minutes actually because they

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.199 
by or two minutes actually because they
don't<00:03:54.170> get<00:03:54.260> Rockets<00:03:54.739> then<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.790> now<00:03:55.939> for<00:03:56.000> that

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
don't get Rockets then to now for that

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.240

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.129 
wanted to rub it in because I played
against<00:06:45.860> them<00:06:46.009> like<00:06:46.189> three<00:06:47.149> times<00:06:47.419> total<00:06:47.930> and

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
against them like three times total and

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.920 
against them like three times total and
so<00:06:49.039> every<00:06:49.909> time<00:06:49.939> he<00:06:50.210> sees<00:06:50.360> me<00:06:50.419> he's<00:06:50.689> just<00:06:50.839> going
