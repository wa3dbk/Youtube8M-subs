00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay so I am really bored right now and

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay so I am really bored right now and
I<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.609> watched<00:00:05.819> Dan<00:00:06.120> Brown's<00:00:06.359> video<00:00:06.660> about

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
I just watched Dan Brown's video about

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.700 
I just watched Dan Brown's video about
how<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.620> solve<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.250> Rubik's<00:00:08.340> Cube<00:00:08.670> faster<00:00:09.710> now

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
how to solve the Rubik's Cube faster now

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.650 
how to solve the Rubik's Cube faster now
like<00:00:10.889> many<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.370> sold<00:00:11.849> my<00:00:12.000> first<00:00:12.030> cube

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
like many of you I sold my first cube

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.609 
like many of you I sold my first cube
with<00:00:13.259> his<00:00:13.469> method<00:00:13.830> using<00:00:14.490> his<00:00:14.580> tutorial<00:00:14.849> and

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
with his method using his tutorial and

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.050 
with his method using his tutorial and
it's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> good<00:00:16.830> tutorial<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.730> simple<00:00:18.029> fact

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
it's a good tutorial but the simple fact

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880 
it's a good tutorial but the simple fact
is<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.449> method<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.869> incredibly<00:00:19.260> slow<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
is this method is incredibly slow and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.550 
is this method is incredibly slow and
his<00:00:20.369> video<00:00:20.670> tutorial<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.449> showing<00:00:22.289> how<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> do

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
his video tutorial for showing how to do

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.870 
his video tutorial for showing how to do
it<00:00:22.650> faster<00:00:23.039> isn't<00:00:23.939> much<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.300> an<00:00:24.510> improvement

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
it faster isn't much of an improvement

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.099 
it faster isn't much of an improvement
now<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> get<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> best<00:00:27.510> times<00:00:27.720> possible

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
now to get the best times possible

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.210 
now to get the best times possible
you're<00:00:28.230> obviously<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> learn

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you're obviously going to want to learn

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.150 
you're obviously going to want to learn
how<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> frisian<00:00:30.330> method<00:00:31.130> but<00:00:32.130> I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
how to do the frisian method but I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
how to do the frisian method but I
realize<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.300> somewhat

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
realize that that can be somewhat

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.380 
realize that that can be somewhat
daunting<00:00:33.899> especially<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.680> beginner<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.670> I'm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
daunting especially to beginner so I'm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.490 
daunting especially to beginner so I'm
gonna<00:00:36.540> show<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> some<00:00:36.899> tips<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.230> will

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
gonna show you some tips that will

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.650 
gonna show you some tips that will
hopefully<00:00:37.980> improve<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.520> times<00:00:38.790> without

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
hopefully improve your times without

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.030 
hopefully improve your times without
having<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> whole<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> memorization

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
having to do a whole lot of memorization

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030 
having to do a whole lot of memorization
or<00:00:41.610> wrap<00:00:42.329> your<00:00:42.480> mind<00:00:42.629> around<00:00:43.040> really

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
or wrap your mind around really

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.369 
or wrap your mind around really
difficult<00:00:44.430> concepts<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:45.989> go

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.619 

now<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.280> tips<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.820> Dan<00:00:51.420> Brown

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
now one of the first tips that Dan Brown

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
now one of the first tips that Dan Brown
gives<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.469> video<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
gives you in this video is that you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.799 
gives you in this video is that you
should<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.699> able<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> solve<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> Cross<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> any

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
should be able to solve the Cross on any

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.770 
should be able to solve the Cross on any
side<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:56.219> may<00:00:56.399> save<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> murder<00:00:57.090> -<00:00:57.329> when

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
side that may save you a murder - when

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.830 
side that may save you a murder - when
you're<00:00:57.930> doing<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.710> cross<00:00:59.340> but<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> plan

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you're doing your cross but if you plan

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
you're doing your cross but if you plan
on<00:01:00.870> where<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.320> freezing<00:01:01.620> method<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.190> will

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
on where your freezing method that will

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.719 
on where your freezing method that will
probably<00:01:03.379> severely<00:01:04.379> hinder<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:04.949> ability<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
probably severely hinder your ability to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.289 
probably severely hinder your ability to
recognize<00:01:07.159> edge<00:01:08.159> corner<00:01:08.490> pairs<00:01:08.760> which<00:01:09.000> you'll

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
recognize edge corner pairs which you'll

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.880 
recognize edge corner pairs which you'll
have<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> learn<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> free<00:01:10.740> trick

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
have to do if you learn the free trick

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
have to do if you learn the free trick
method<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:13.350> recommend<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.430> focus<00:01:15.119> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
method so I recommend that you focus on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
method so I recommend that you focus on
solving<00:01:15.659> from<00:01:16.170> either<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> yellow<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
solving from either the yellow or the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.810 
solving from either the yellow or the
white<00:01:18.060> sides<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.570> cube<00:01:19.430> because<00:01:20.430> those

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
white sides of your cube because those

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.359 
white sides of your cube because those
are<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> easiest<00:01:21.299> recognize<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:22.770> stand<00:01:23.250> out

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
are the easiest recognize they stand out

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
are the easiest recognize they stand out
the<00:01:23.490> most<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.030> cube<00:01:24.890> okay<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.369> gonna

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the most on your cube okay so I'm gonna

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
the most on your cube okay so I'm gonna
go<00:01:26.670> ahead<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.880> blow<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> cross<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:30.290> okay<00:01:31.290> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
go ahead and blow the cross here okay so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.550 
go ahead and blow the cross here okay so
here<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> cross<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.350> we're<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
here we have a cross and we're going to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.550 
here we have a cross and we're going to
put<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> bottom<00:01:36.200> we're<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.320> place

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
put it on the bottom we're gonna place

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.300 
put it on the bottom we're gonna place
the<00:01:37.740> corners<00:01:38.070> next<00:01:39.890> here's<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> corner<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the corners next here's the corner that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.740 
the corners next here's the corner that
we<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> place<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.770> white

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
we want to place right here it's white

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.679 
we want to place right here it's white
red<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> green<00:01:46.850> as<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.210> across<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
red and green as you can see across this

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.560 
red and green as you can see across this
white<00:01:48.899> here's<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.950> red<00:01:50.130> side<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.210> here's<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
white here's the red side and here's the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.319 
white here's the red side and here's the
green<00:01:51.720> side<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.520> doing<00:01:53.759> red<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
green side so so doing red and put it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.120 
green side so so doing red and put it
down<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> right<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:55.020> we're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
down over it right down we're going to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.709 
down over it right down we're going to
do<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:57.140> up<00:01:58.729> red<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.759> written<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
do right up red and written out the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.139 
do right up red and written out the
route<00:02:00.930> that'll<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> although<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> don't

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
route that'll do it although you don't

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
the various cases of this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
the various cases of this
because<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:14.879> be<00:02:14.970> able<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> figure

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
because you should be able to figure

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.000 
because you should be able to figure
them<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.599> your<00:02:15.720> own<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.110> want<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.769> think

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
them out on your own I want you to think

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.070 
them out on your own I want you to think
intuitively<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:18.420> think<00:02:18.599> about<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
intuitively don't think about just

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.380 
intuitively don't think about just
putting<00:02:19.650> places<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.370> certain<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:21.090> putting

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
putting places in certain or putting

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.600

pieces in certain places than doing an

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.390 
pieces in certain places than doing an
algorithm<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.409> voila<00:02:25.409> it's<00:02:25.650> there<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.310> need

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
algorithm and voila it's there you need

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.920 
algorithm and voila it's there you need
to<00:02:26.519> think<00:02:26.730> about<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.750> queue

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
to think about the way that the queue

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.880 
to think about the way that the queue
works<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.569> what<00:02:30.569> do<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.870> then<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.379> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
works so what do you do then is you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.110 
works so what do you do then is you
place<00:02:32.580> all<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.660> one<00:02:34.230> corner<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.819> have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
place all but one corner so you have

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.830 
place all but one corner so you have
three<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.140> four<00:02:37.430> corner<00:02:38.430> pieces

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
three of the four corner pieces

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.080 
three of the four corner pieces
inserting<00:02:40.280> now<00:02:41.280> we're<00:02:41.430> gonna<00:02:41.519> use<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.879> I'm

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
inserting now we're gonna use this I'm

on<00:02:47.519> YouTube<00:02:47.640> about<00:02:48.120> how<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.200> method

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
on YouTube about how to do this method

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.110 
on YouTube about how to do this method
and<00:02:49.709> they're<00:02:50.010> probably<00:02:50.370> better<00:02:50.730> than<00:02:50.940> mine

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and they're probably better than mine

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
and they're probably better than mine
but<00:02:52.019> I'm<00:02:52.140> gonna<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:52.530> best<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.859> explain<00:02:53.160> that

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
but I'm gonna do my best to explain that

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.660 
but I'm gonna do my best to explain that
here

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
here

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.660 
here
let's<00:02:54.090> find<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.329> method<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.670> here's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
let's find this method here so here's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.119 
let's find this method here so here's
the<00:02:56.730> edge<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.030> charm<00:02:57.209> place<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.829> want<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> put

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
the edge of charm place you want to put

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.069 
the edge of charm place you want to put
it<00:02:59.220> here<00:02:59.250> because<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> was<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.359> red<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
it here because it was the red and the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.770 
it here because it was the red and the
green<00:03:01.790> there's<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.910> red<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.480> there's<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
green there's the red and there's the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.229 
green there's the red and there's the
green<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.650> well<00:03:05.250> normally<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.879> would<00:03:05.970> start

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
green so well normally you would start

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.300 
green so well normally you would start
out<00:03:06.299> with<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.690> edge<00:03:06.930> right<00:03:07.230> here<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.280> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
out with this edge right here so that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.550 
out with this edge right here so that
these<00:03:08.700> colors<00:03:08.970> line<00:03:09.269> up<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:10.109> want<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.319> do<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
these colors line up you want to do the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.500 
these colors line up you want to do the
opposite<00:03:10.950> right<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.329> have<00:03:12.420> this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
opposite right now so you have this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.680 
opposite right now so you have this
pattern<00:03:13.310> green<00:03:14.310> red<00:03:15.090> green<00:03:15.950> now<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.690> bring

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
pattern green red green now you bring

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.890 
pattern green red green now you bring
this<00:03:19.169> edge<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.220> top<00:03:20.400> layer<00:03:20.639> by<00:03:21.480> rotating

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
this edge to the top layer by rotating

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.690 
this edge to the top layer by rotating
the<00:03:22.109> site<00:03:22.349> that<00:03:22.590> does<00:03:22.739> not<00:03:22.950> have<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.459> edge

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
the site that does not have this edge

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.250 
the site that does not have this edge
piece<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.660> edge<00:03:24.750> pieces<00:03:25.049> shown<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
piece in it the edge pieces shown a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.879 
piece in it the edge pieces shown a
place<00:03:26.510> bring<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.630> up<00:03:28.220> move<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> edge<00:03:29.549> over<00:03:30.090> and

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
place bring it up move the edge over and

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.720 
place bring it up move the edge over and
put<00:03:31.889> it<00:03:31.919> in<00:03:33.319> now<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.769> may<00:03:35.190> take<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> bit<00:03:35.579> of

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
put it in now it may take a bit of

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.839 
put it in now it may take a bit of
getting<00:03:36.090> used<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.079> this<00:03:37.769> method<00:03:38.040> but

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
getting used to to do this method but

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.849 
getting used to to do this method but
you<00:03:39.150> should<00:03:39.930> get<00:03:40.109> used<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.470> pretty<00:03:40.560> quickly

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
you should get used to it pretty quickly

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.240 
you should get used to it pretty quickly
and<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:42.720> go<00:03:42.989> ahead<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.410> use<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.859> method<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and you go ahead and use this method to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.770 
and you go ahead and use this method to
place<00:03:45.980> three<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.579> four<00:03:47.760> edges<00:03:47.910> always

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
place three of the four edges always

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.349 
place three of the four edges always
make<00:03:49.019> sure<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:50.010> your<00:03:50.190> unsolved<00:03:50.700> corner<00:03:51.030> is

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
make sure that your unsolved corner is

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.809 
make sure that your unsolved corner is

see you there for three of them now you
put<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.849> unsolved<00:04:03.569> corner<00:04:04.489> underneath<00:04:05.569> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
put the unsolved corner underneath the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.890 
put the unsolved corner underneath the
one<00:04:06.720> remaining<00:04:06.989> unsolved<00:04:07.440> edge<00:04:08.750> find<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
one remaining unsolved edge find the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.229 
one remaining unsolved edge find the
corner<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.319> want<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.560> put<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:10.739> there

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
corner that you want to put in there

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.850 
corner that you want to put in there
and<00:04:12.239> insert<00:04:12.810> it

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
and insert it

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.810 
and insert it
then<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.940> put<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.300> last<00:04:15.570> edge<00:04:15.810> piece<00:04:16.019> in

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
then you put this last edge piece in

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.539 
then you put this last edge piece in
normally<00:04:18.410> with<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.530> algorithm<00:04:20.040> from<00:04:20.190> Dan

Brown's<00:04:20.760> video<00:04:21.650> then<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.740> go<00:04:22.920> into<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.580> last

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
Brown's video then you go into the last

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.080 
Brown's video then you go into the last
layer<00:04:24.560> okay<00:04:25.560> with<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.760> should<00:04:26.790> have

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
layer okay with that you should have

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.720 
layer okay with that you should have
your<00:04:27.390> entire<00:04:27.720> first<00:04:28.080> two<00:04:28.200> layer<00:04:28.350> salt<00:04:28.710> then<00:04:29.640> we

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
your entire first two layer salt then we

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.270 
your entire first two layer salt then we
move<00:04:29.910> on<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.360> last<00:04:30.540> layer<00:04:30.920> now<00:04:31.920> in<00:04:32.070> Dan

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
move on to the last layer now in Dan

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.690 
move on to the last layer now in Dan
Brown's<00:04:32.310> video<00:04:32.820> he<00:04:33.000> teaches<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:33.660> four<00:04:34.080> cases

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
Brown's video he teaches you four cases

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.810

you<00:04:35.700> have<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.780> L<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.730> line<00:04:39.680> across<00:04:40.680> or<00:04:41.550> just

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
you have the L the line across or just

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.260 
you have the L the line across or just
the<00:04:41.940> dot<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:44.190> see<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.460> if<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
the dot now you see that if you have the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.880 
the dot now you see that if you have the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
L you put it in the upper left hand side

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.950 
L you put it in the upper left hand side
like<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.270> then<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.510> do<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.750> algorithm

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
like this and then you do the algorithm

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.560 
like this and then you do the algorithm
front<00:04:53.000> right<00:04:54.000> up<00:04:54.660> right<00:04:55.490> inverted<00:04:56.490> up<00:04:57.270> and

Christian way of doing it instead what I

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.330 
Christian way of doing it instead what I
want<00:05:13.110> you<00:05:13.200> to<00:05:13.320> do<00:05:13.790> is<00:05:14.790> here<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.090> see<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.390> L

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
want you to do is here you see the L

instead<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.490> putting<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:17.790> up<00:05:17.910> here<00:05:18.740> put<00:05:19.740> it

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
instead of putting it up here put it

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.560 
instead of putting it up here put it
down<00:05:20.040> here<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:21.900> right<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.919> bottom

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
down here so that the right and bottom

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.690 
down here so that the right and bottom

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
last layer color on top and it's do you

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.120 
last layer color on top and it's do you
do<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.120> exact<00:05:30.450> same<00:05:30.479> algorithm<00:05:31.229> but<00:05:31.770> instead

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
do the exact same algorithm but instead

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.370 
do the exact same algorithm but instead
of<00:05:32.190> just<00:05:32.310> moving<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:32.880> first<00:05:33.270> front<00:05:34.200> layer

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
of just moving this first front layer

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.690 
of just moving this first front layer
here<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:37.620> go<00:05:37.770> ahead<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.130> grab<00:05:38.310> both<00:05:38.550> of

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
here you go ahead and you grab both of

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:49.250 
here you go ahead and you grab both of
them<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:39.990> do<00:05:41.600> little<00:05:42.600> F<00:05:43.970> R<00:05:45.320> u<00:05:46.790> R<00:05:47.790> prime<00:05:48.300> u

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
them so you do little F R u R prime u

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.610 
them so you do little F R u R prime u
prime<00:05:49.850> little<00:05:50.850> F<00:05:51.000> Prime<00:05:51.330> that<00:05:52.229> takes<00:05:52.500> you

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
prime little F Prime that takes you

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:00.270 
prime little F Prime that takes you
directly<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.820> cross

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.950 

okay<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:01.340> there<00:06:01.760> you<00:06:01.880> have<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.060> first<00:06:02.780> two

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
okay so there you have it first two

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.260 
okay so there you have it first two
layers<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:04.310> cross<00:06:04.520> on<00:06:05.150> your<00:06:05.270> last<00:06:05.420> layer

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
layers and the cross on your last layer

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.290 
layers and the cross on your last layer
now<00:06:08.560> his<00:06:09.560> method<00:06:09.920> of<00:06:10.010> placing<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:10.910> corners

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
now his method of placing the corners

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.810 
now his method of placing the corners
and<00:06:11.540> then<00:06:11.980> oriented<00:06:12.980> correctly<00:06:13.190> is<00:06:13.490> actually

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
and then oriented correctly is actually

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.270 
and then oriented correctly is actually
incredibly<00:06:14.150> slow<00:06:14.450> too<00:06:14.770> but<00:06:15.770> I'm<00:06:15.920> not<00:06:15.950> gonna

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
incredibly slow too but I'm not gonna

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.130 
incredibly slow too but I'm not gonna
get<00:06:16.550> into<00:06:16.700> that<00:06:16.820> right<00:06:17.120> now<00:06:17.180> because<00:06:17.480> that'll

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
get into that right now because that'll

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.050 
get into that right now because that'll
come<00:06:18.320> up<00:06:18.440> when<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.740> learn<00:06:18.950> the<00:06:19.730> free<00:06:19.910> trick

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
have to flip it in post cuz it decides

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.510 
have to flip it in post cuz it decides
it<00:06:45.440> look<00:06:45.560> like<00:06:45.680> it's<00:06:45.860> a<00:06:45.920> mirror<00:06:46.100> the<00:06:46.190> image<00:06:46.370> but

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
it look like it's a mirror the image but

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.950 
it look like it's a mirror the image but
anyway<00:06:47.270> um<00:06:48.880> yeah<00:06:49.880> certain<00:06:50.600> that<00:06:50.690> I'll<00:06:50.840> just

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
anyway um yeah certain that I'll just

00:06:50.960 --> 00:07:57.080 
anyway um yeah certain that I'll just
show<00:06:51.110> you<00:06:51.140> a<00:06:51.260> example<00:06:51.830> song<00:06:52.370> now

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.090 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.270 

hope<00:07:58.090> that<00:07:58.270> was<00:07:58.390> useful<00:07:58.450> to<00:07:58.810> at<00:07:59.080> least<00:07:59.290> a<00:07:59.590> few

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 
hope that was useful to at least a few

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.730 
hope that was useful to at least a few
of<00:08:00.340> you<00:08:00.550> and<00:08:00.880> hopefully<00:08:01.210> your<00:08:02.200> solve<00:08:02.500> times

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:02.740 
of you and hopefully your solve times

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.460 
of you and hopefully your solve times
will<00:08:03.010> get<00:08:03.190> a<00:08:03.220> little<00:08:03.520> bit<00:08:03.640> better<00:08:03.760> and<00:08:04.290> in<00:08:05.290> the

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:05.470 
will get a little bit better and in the

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.780 
will get a little bit better and in the
future<00:08:05.740> you<00:08:05.860> should<00:08:05.890> definitely<00:08:06.520> pick<00:08:06.670> up

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:06.790 
future you should definitely pick up

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.890 
future you should definitely pick up
Friedrichs<00:08:07.360> or<00:08:07.480> rope<00:08:07.870> or<00:08:09.210> Petrus<00:08:10.210> one<00:08:10.810> of

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:10.900 
Friedrichs or rope or Petrus one of

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.620 
Friedrichs or rope or Petrus one of
those<00:08:11.020> faster<00:08:11.350> minutes
