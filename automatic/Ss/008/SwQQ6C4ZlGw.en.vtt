00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.260 

so<00:05:00.570> it's<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.930> turn<00:05:01.759> and<00:05:02.759> the<00:05:03.030> British

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
so it's on the turn and the British

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.400 
so it's on the turn and the British
probably<00:05:03.630> gonna<00:05:03.720> land<00:05:04.020> now<00:05:07.310> it's<00:05:08.310> no<00:05:08.430> big<00:05:08.610> deal

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
probably gonna land now it's no big deal

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:19.020 
probably gonna land now it's no big deal
more<00:05:10.410> experience<00:05:10.830> for<00:05:10.949> me

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.910 

and<00:05:19.660> they<00:05:19.780> still<00:05:20.020> haven't<00:05:20.050> landed<00:05:20.440> for<00:05:20.770> some

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
and they still haven't landed for some

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.420 
and they still haven't landed for some
reason<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.580> kind<00:05:21.700> of<00:05:21.790> ridiculous<00:05:23.430> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
reason it's kind of ridiculous the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.540 
reason it's kind of ridiculous the
British<00:05:24.760> are<00:05:24.850> hesitant<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:25.540> attack<00:05:25.870> me<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:27.040> it

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
British are hesitant to attack me so it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.970 
British are hesitant to attack me so it
