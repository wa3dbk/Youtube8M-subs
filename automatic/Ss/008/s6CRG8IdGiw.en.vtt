point 11 points are already but we

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.289 
point 11 points are already but we

probably don't even know that um I mean

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.170 
probably don't even know that um I mean
we<00:03:20.930> still<00:03:21.230> don't<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.799> ghast<00:03:22.160> spawn<00:03:22.910> eggs

not so sure but let's hope that golems
are<00:03:31.160> added<00:03:31.519> all<00:03:32.000> right<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.480> all<00:03:32.720> right<00:03:33.290> so

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
are added all right so all right so

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.629 
are added all right so all right so
moving<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:35.900> e<00:03:36.169> it<00:03:36.440> could<00:03:36.680> be<00:03:36.889> enchanting

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
moving on for e it could be enchanting

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.930 
moving on for e it could be enchanting
or<00:03:37.819> experience<00:03:38.810> um<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.769> would<00:03:40.040> rather<00:03:40.340> go<00:03:40.699> with

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
or experience um I would rather go with

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.780 
or experience um I would rather go with
enchanting<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.470> then<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.430> think<00:03:43.669> about

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
enchanting but then if you think about

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.869 
enchanting but then if you think about
it<00:03:44.949> experience<00:03:45.949> is<00:03:46.129> actually<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.579> good

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
it experience is actually a good

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.569 
it experience is actually a good

comment section down below do you guys
think<00:04:00.889> enchanting<00:04:01.639> would<00:04:01.790> be<00:04:01.940> better<00:04:02.150> than

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
think enchanting would be better than

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.610 
think enchanting would be better than
experience<00:04:03.349> or<00:04:03.709> vice<00:04:04.010> versa<00:04:04.690> all<00:04:05.690> right<00:04:05.870> for<00:04:06.290> a

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
experience or vice versa all right for a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.030 
experience or vice versa all right for a
it<00:04:07.099> would<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.579> achieved<00:04:08.120> mints<00:04:08.479> and<00:04:09.040> that

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
it would be achieved mints and that

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.009 
it would be achieved mints and that
would<00:04:10.190> be<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.579> really<00:04:10.909> great<00:04:11.180> implementation

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
would be a really great implementation

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.969 
would be a really great implementation
because<00:04:12.319> we've<00:04:13.010> been<00:04:13.040> waiting<00:04:13.579> for<00:04:13.879> this<00:04:14.030> all

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
because we've been waiting for this all

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.699 
because we've been waiting for this all
for<00:04:15.979> a<00:04:16.010> long<00:04:16.220> time<00:04:16.549> now<00:04:16.789> okay<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.870> like<00:04:18.440> it's

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
for a long time now okay and like it's

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.879 
for a long time now okay and like it's
been<00:04:18.919> unspoken<00:04:19.400> but<00:04:19.909> you<00:04:20.479> know<00:04:20.889> achievements

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
been unspoken but you know achievements

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.250 
been unspoken but you know achievements
are<00:04:22.090> supposed<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.210> be<00:04:23.360> done<00:04:23.630> without<00:04:23.870> being

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
are supposed to be done without being

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.000 
are supposed to be done without being
said<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.770> know

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
said you know

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.700 
said you know
no<00:04:25.040> it's<00:04:25.730> a<00:04:25.850> given<00:04:27.400> let's<00:04:28.400> also<00:04:28.550> move<00:04:28.850> on<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.710> FP

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
no it's a given let's also move on to FP

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.620 
no it's a given let's also move on to FP
and<00:04:30.920> that's<00:04:31.430> probably<00:04:31.910> going<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.210> be<00:04:32.270> flower

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
and that's probably going to be flower

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.010 
and that's probably going to be flower
pots<00:04:32.990> in<00:04:33.320> Pocket<00:04:34.310> Edition<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.880> that's<00:04:35.840> pretty

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
pots in Pocket Edition and that's pretty

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.940 
pots in Pocket Edition and that's pretty
cool<00:04:36.260> um<00:04:37.540> it's<00:04:38.540> not<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> huge<00:04:39.140> feature<00:04:39.470> but

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
cool um it's not a huge feature but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.800 
cool um it's not a huge feature but
flower<00:04:40.220> pots<00:04:40.520> that's<00:04:40.760> pretty<00:04:41.000> cool<00:04:41.120> adds<00:04:41.390> a

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
flower pots that's pretty cool adds a

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.170 
flower pots that's pretty cool adds a

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
little eye candy to the game adds a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.410 
little eye candy to the game adds a
little<00:04:44.210> spice<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.380> game<00:04:45.560> some<00:04:45.830> jalapeno

uh-huh but alright so let's move on to
the<00:04:50.480> final<00:04:50.930> feature<00:04:51.110> which<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:51.820> CS<00:04:52.820> which<00:04:53.150> is

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
the final feature which is CS which is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.970 
the final feature which is CS which is
probably<00:04:53.720> going<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.050> be<00:04:54.110> controller<00:04:54.680> support

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
probably going to be controller support

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.280 
probably going to be controller support
since<00:04:55.850> you<00:04:56.060> know<00:04:56.180> Tom<00:04:56.450> CC<00:04:56.810> actually<00:04:57.140> already

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290

is<00:05:00.140> a<00:05:00.170> confirmed<00:05:00.710> feature<00:05:01.010> controller

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
is a confirmed feature controller

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.020 
is a confirmed feature controller
support<00:05:02.030> which<00:05:02.810> would<00:05:03.350> lead<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.250> new<00:05:04.520> GUI

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030
