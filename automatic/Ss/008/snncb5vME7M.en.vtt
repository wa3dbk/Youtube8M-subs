 half a clove of garlic around very nearly 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.300
 let's say all the tomato puree 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.059

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.610
 50 grams of cooked ham and 50 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.580
 grams of mortadella which we will then go to 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.949
 chop up half of a pack of 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.360

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.990
 grated parmesan and put them 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.300
 abundantly around 300 grams of 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.180

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.130
 pasta for two people 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:20.390
 enters the dizzy salt they go ok in 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.960
 room only by putting olive oil 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.960
 inside 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.600
 so far I have so put it back 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.130
 the clove of garlic and half a clove 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 of garlic practices and we make a loom 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:53.540
 so now let's put the tomato three 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:57.260
 parts of the past make you plan that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.430
 the ostrich oil and you also put it in 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.740
 half a glass of water 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:06.130
 so it was better then on the fire and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.789
 turn to cook 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.080
 the sauce about half an hour is excellent fruit 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:25.120
 and you don't see that it is cooked but not without 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:28.269
 but add it as you wish now 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.860
 we take the decrease directly 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:36.989
 as closely as possible to visit the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:40.470
 difficult sleeves after half an hour 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.470
 enough has been done 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:52.569
 let's take the truth that we go to 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:58.090
 put in and let cook for 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:03.060
 another 5 minutes you see meanwhile put 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.060
 the water on the fire and I wait for it to spring 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.480
 ok he got another 57 minutes to do 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.700

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.850
 off the fire and the pasta is cooking 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.500
 if you drain pasta and sauce maybe you are 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.470
 cooled the warmed up a little if not 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.840
