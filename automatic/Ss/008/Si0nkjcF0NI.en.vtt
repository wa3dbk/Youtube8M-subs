this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.149> would<00:00:36.239> look<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.620> half<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
this is what it would look like half a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.459 
this is what it would look like half a
cup<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> serving<00:00:39.510> they<00:00:39.629> suggest<00:00:40.200> on

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
cup this is the serving they suggest on

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.119 
cup this is the serving they suggest on
the<00:00:41.460> container<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.420> many<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.739> going

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the container now many of you are going

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
the container now many of you are going
to<00:00:44.190> drink<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.450> than<00:00:45.629> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to drink a little bit more than this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.310 
to drink a little bit more than this
realistically<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.239> double<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
realistically so if we double this to a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.680 
realistically so if we double this to a
cup<00:00:49.739> remember<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:50.910> here's<00:00:51.149> where<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.390> gets<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
cup remember now here's where it gets a

cup remember now here's where it gets a
little<00:00:51.809> tricky<00:00:52.460> energy<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.670> now<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.840> very

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
little tricky energy up now is very very
