00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.949
 The first kilometers in Georgia are going, we wanted to go not to stop 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.830
 to Batumi itself, but everywhere is so beautiful 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.150
 what not to stop is simply not possible. 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.460
 Look, there is snow here though today is May 27th, but of course itâ€™s 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.970
 the mountains, and the beauty that is around, it's just awesome! 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:32.099
 We drive through the whole territory of Georgia to the sea in Batumi. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.390
 This is what Georgian climate means, they say here. 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.500
 five climates in one country :) This is Batumi - see, from behind 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.820
 me sea, sunny weather, very light, and if we 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.940
 turn around just 180 degrees, then you will see 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.400
 the mountains are completely dark here, there are clouds here. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.100
 In Georgia, the warm Black Sea and a lot of investment goes to tourism and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.000
 construction of infrastructure of Batumi and other resorts. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.040
 7 days in Georgia, now we are in the city of Borjomi, only 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.489
 that they drank mineral water from the sources of Borjomi. 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.230
 I have amazing feelings, these are the most unforgettable. 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.200
 days, this is the greatest beauty in life that I have seen. 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.159
 Georgia she deserves to come here to 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.010
 live here. The nature is just amazing, here 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.790
 a huge number of caves, waterfalls, all kinds 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.769
 mountains, gorges. There is something to admire every day 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.799
 and you cannot reconsider everything even if you live for a whole year. 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.040
 There are a lot of attractions. 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.790
 This was my first trip to Georgia, I naturally 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.000
 after that I start to go here often. I know how here 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.450
 do business, if anyone is interested, ask 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.410
 I'll tell you. Georgia is an amazing country, you have to live here, 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.410
 need to come here.
