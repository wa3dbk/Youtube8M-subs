00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.450
 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 that is given with the great 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.940
 facto 3 and the grand theft auto vice city 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.109
 when we are going to execute them we are left 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.970
 pasted on this palette and good for 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.730
 solve this is super easy boys 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 the first thing is to identify where we have 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.470
 installed our game we go here to the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.060
 grand theft auto '3 or grand theft 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.250
 auto vice city does not matter what we put 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.300
 properties in properties we see 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.480
 local files 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.579
 but local files we define then 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.010
 what 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.510
 our game is installed in our 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.570
 hard drive program files x86 steam 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.309
 sting common apps and grand theft auto vice 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.210
 city ​​then we have to look for this 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.460
 common folder within our 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.890
 steam applications within the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.909
 folder I was that is the route program 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890
 files steam 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.980
 apps code there we have all installed 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.620
 our style games 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.210
 well we solve this from the next 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.240
 friends way 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.759
 computer properties 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.920
 advanced system settings or properties 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.190
 advanced system we are going to 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.010
 Performance or performance 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.040
 performance options until exclusion 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.710
 prevention or data that would be the 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:36.960
 Spanish I think this time and we add the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:39.440
 gp to 3 and gta 307 ay at that point xxi 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.860
 to add it is 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.409
 add sheets and choose the folder 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.270
 [Music] 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.640
 that we had just seen on the route 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.469
 where we had installed the game choose 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.909
 the folders of grand theft auto vice 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.969
 city 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.880
 the executables and open them and add 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.060
 of email is that simple the assumption and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.920
 is for both games the same 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.100
 they are pretty old games that give us 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.229
 this problem because I think it's the same 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.890
 I think that's why that's why 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.780
 they are very old so you have to do 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.750
 this data execution prevention 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.800
 and that is the solution is that simple 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.319
 so I hope you have served 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.140

 so I hope I helped them 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.540
