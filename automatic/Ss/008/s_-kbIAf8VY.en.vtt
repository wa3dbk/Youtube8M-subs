00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
to talk about how to photograph neon

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.499 
to talk about how to photograph neon
signs<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> can<00:00:05.850> make<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.150> very<00:00:06.420> very

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
signs now you can make this very very

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.570 
signs now you can make this very very
technical<00:00:07.290> if<00:00:07.440> you'd<00:00:07.589> like<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:08.429> can<00:00:08.519> use

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
technical if you'd like you can use

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.640 
technical if you'd like you can use
light<00:00:09.000> meters<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.660> meter<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.290> light<00:00:10.469> that's

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
light meters and meter the light that's

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.759 
light meters and meter the light that's
coming<00:00:10.769> off<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.670> actual<00:00:12.090> sign<00:00:12.360> itself<00:00:12.769> and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
coming off of the actual sign itself and

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.079 
coming off of the actual sign itself and
that's<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> exposure<00:00:14.460> you're<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> want

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that's the exposure you're going to want

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.910 
that's the exposure you're going to want
to<00:00:15.120> get<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.509> don't<00:00:15.780> want<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> hold<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.410> facing

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to get you don't want to hold it facing

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.680 
to get you don't want to hold it facing
the<00:00:17.070> camera<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.760> would<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> subject

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the camera like you would with a subject

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.750 
the camera like you would with a subject
that<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.320> light<00:00:19.619> falling<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.279> that's<00:00:20.580> when

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that has light falling on it that's when

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.519 
that has light falling on it that's when
you<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:21.029> photograph<00:00:21.240> say<00:00:21.720> using<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.230> Sun

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you would photograph say using the Sun

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.950 
you would photograph say using the Sun
this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.519> an<00:00:23.760> incident<00:00:24.060> light<00:00:24.359> meter<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.840> if

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
this is an incident light meter so if

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.420 
this is an incident light meter so if
you<00:00:25.080> put<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.410> front<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.800> subject<00:00:26.279> turn

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you put it in front of your subject turn

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.310 
you put it in front of your subject turn
it<00:00:26.550> back<00:00:26.730> towards<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> camera<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> meters<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it back towards the camera it meters the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
it back towards the camera it meters the
light<00:00:28.500> that's<00:00:28.680> falling<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:30.090> we're

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
light that's falling on it what we're

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
light that's falling on it what we're
doing<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.750> taking<00:00:30.900> photographs<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.710> something

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
doing is taking photographs of something

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
doing is taking photographs of something
that<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.369> light<00:00:32.640> coming<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.050> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that has light coming out of it so in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.930 
that has light coming out of it so in
that<00:00:34.530> situation<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.219> would<00:00:35.370> basically<00:00:35.489> take

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that situation you would basically take

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.979 
that situation you would basically take
the<00:00:36.090> light<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.899> an

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the light in here if you have an

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.600 
the light in here if you have an
incident<00:00:37.290> light<00:00:37.530> meter<00:00:37.770> point<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> towards

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
incident light meter point it towards

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.729 
incident light meter point it towards
the<00:00:38.820> subject<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:40.079> would<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> sign

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the subject which would be the sign

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.150 
the subject which would be the sign
whatever<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.879> whatever<00:00:42.540> neon<00:00:42.989> light<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
whatever it is whatever neon light that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.410 
whatever it is whatever neon light that
you're<00:00:44.280> photographing<00:00:44.520> whether<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you're photographing whether it be a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
you're photographing whether it be a
sign<00:00:45.660> or<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:45.960> another<00:00:46.140> object<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.640> can

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
sign or an another object and you can

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.069 
sign or an another object and you can
meter<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.329> way<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.899> an

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
meter it that way if you have an

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
meter it that way if you have an
in-camera<00:00:49.500> meter<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.700> most<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
in-camera meter I'm like most of the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.689 
in-camera meter I'm like most of the
SLRs<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.960> you're<00:00:52.140> shooting<00:00:52.289> film<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.550> can

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
SLRs do if you're shooting film you can

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.189 
SLRs do if you're shooting film you can
use<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.300> sometimes<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.899> want<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> maybe

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
use it and sometimes you want to maybe

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
use it and sometimes you want to maybe
do<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> stop<00:00:55.829> under<00:00:56.219> stop<00:00:56.520> over<00:00:56.850> bracket

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
do a stop under stop over bracket

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.420 
do a stop under stop over bracket
depending<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> sign<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
depending on the sign if you have a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
depending on the sign if you have a
digital<00:00:59.640> camera<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.480> simply<00:01:00.780> take<00:01:00.960> an

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
digital camera you can simply take an

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
digital camera you can simply take an
exposure<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.649> tend<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> set<00:01:02.280> mine<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.609> manual

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
exposure I tend to set mine on manual

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.390 
exposure I tend to set mine on manual
when<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:03.390> shooting<00:01:03.570> lights<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
when I'm shooting lights like this that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
when I'm shooting lights like this that
way<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> stop

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
way I know if I you know go down a stop

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
way I know if I you know go down a stop
or<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.280> stop<00:01:08.580> it'll<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.000> brighter<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.479> darker

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
or up a stop it'll be brighter or darker

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.870 
or up a stop it'll be brighter or darker
now<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.560> you're<00:01:10.650> using<00:01:10.680> digital<00:01:11.100> cameras<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
now if you're using digital cameras and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
now if you're using digital cameras and
you're<00:01:11.970> photographing<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.750> sign<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.439> on

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you're photographing a sign and it on

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.200 
you're photographing a sign and it on
the<00:01:14.040> back<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> camera<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.790> looks<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> little

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the back of the camera it looks a little

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.789 
the back of the camera it looks a little
dark<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.900> point<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> might<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
dark at that point you might want to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
dark at that point you might want to
open<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> shutter<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.150> longer<00:01:18.390> say<00:01:18.720> go

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
open the shutter a little longer say go

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
open the shutter a little longer say go
down<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> thirtieth<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.009> second<00:01:20.430> instead

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
down to a thirtieth of a second instead

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
down to a thirtieth of a second instead
of<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> sixtieth<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.080> at

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of a sixtieth if that's where you're at

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.640 
of a sixtieth if that's where you're at
or<00:01:22.619> say<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.060> dark<00:01:24.439> or<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
or say it's a little bit dark or a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.749 
or say it's a little bit dark or a
little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:25.950> bright<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> would<00:01:26.490> want<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
little bit bright you would want to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.030 
little bit bright you would want to
actually<00:01:26.970> increase<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.720> exposure<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> make

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
actually increase the exposure and make

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.679 
actually increase the exposure and make
that<00:01:29.189> shutter<00:01:29.460> faster<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that shutter faster so you can go up to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.590 
that shutter faster so you can go up to
like<00:01:30.810> maybe<00:01:30.990> 120<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.860> they're<00:01:32.040> 250th<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.479> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
like maybe 120 if they're 250th and that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.880 
like maybe 120 if they're 250th and that
would<00:01:33.720> help<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.079> well

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
would help as well

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.679 
would help as well
and<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.939> making<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.390> complicated

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and but as far as making it complicated

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.630 
and but as far as making it complicated
you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> get<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> gadgets

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you can if you want to get the gadgets

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can if you want to get the gadgets
I've<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.299> color<00:01:39.810> meter<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> light<00:01:40.740> meter

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I've got a color meter or a light meter

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
I've got a color meter or a light meter
here<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> I've<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> new

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
here and I've also got one of the new

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
here and I've also got one of the new
color<00:01:42.990> meters<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.500> thing<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> great<00:01:44.299> for

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
color meters this thing is great for

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
color meters this thing is great for
photographing<00:01:45.930> anything<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.680> mean<00:01:46.829> anything

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
photographing anything I mean anything

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
photographing anything I mean anything
it<00:01:47.880> does<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> couple<00:01:49.020> times<00:01:49.229> where<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it does have a couple times where the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
it does have a couple times where the
lights<00:01:49.740> low<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> spectrums<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
lights low in the spectrums off the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
lights low in the spectrums off the
chart<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.110> wouldn't<00:01:52.350> match<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
chart here so it wouldn't match the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.249 
chart here so it wouldn't match the
camera<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> doesn't<00:01:53.759> read<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.930> rarely

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
camera so it doesn't read but rarely

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.260 
camera so it doesn't read but rarely
does<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.799> happen<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.310> use<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> at

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
does that happen I use this thing and at

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.730 
does that happen I use this thing and at
the<00:01:57.450> end<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> day<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.200> portraits<00:01:58.530> out

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the end of the day to do portraits out

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.560 
the end of the day to do portraits out
on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> beach<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.610> hold<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
on the beach or I can hold it up and and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
on the beach or I can hold it up and and
we'll<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.079> try<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> out<00:02:01.560> real<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:01.979> here

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
we'll just try it out real here here

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.569 
we'll just try it out real here here
real<00:02:02.939> quick<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.100> now<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.189> gonna<00:02:05.310> hold<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
real quick and now I'm gonna hold this

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
real quick and now I'm gonna hold this
up<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> light<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.329> shining<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.780> me

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
up to the light that's shining on me

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
up to the light that's shining on me
right<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.619> I'm<00:02:08.160> getting<00:02:08.340> twenty<00:02:08.879> nine

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
right now and I'm getting twenty nine

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.380 
right now and I'm getting twenty nine
thirty<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.009> 2009

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
thirty that's 2009

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.450 
thirty that's 2009
thirty<00:02:11.810> Calvin<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.950> that's<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.250> color

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
thirty Calvin and that's the color

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.280 
thirty Calvin and that's the color
temperature<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.540> wanted<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
temperature so if you wanted the the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.260 
temperature so if you wanted the the
sign<00:02:15.560> if<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.920> had<00:02:16.070> say<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> white<00:02:16.640> light<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
sign if it had say a white light in it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210 
sign if it had say a white light in it
then<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.170> could<00:02:18.320> simply<00:02:18.470> hold<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.980> up

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
then you could simply hold this up

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.950 
then you could simply hold this up
because<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.730> turns<00:02:20.030> whatever<00:02:20.390> light<00:02:20.780> you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
because this turns whatever light you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.570 
because this turns whatever light you
got<00:02:21.170> whatever<00:02:21.560> light<00:02:21.770> you're<00:02:21.920> reading<00:02:22.250> into

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
got whatever light you're reading into

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.180 
got whatever light you're reading into
white<00:02:22.790> light<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.050> if<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.290> did<00:02:24.470> set<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.860> camera

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
white light so if you did set the camera

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.860 
white light so if you did set the camera
to<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.430> Kelvin<00:02:25.820> temperature<00:02:25.850> at<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.570> point

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
to the Kelvin temperature at that point

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.320 
to the Kelvin temperature at that point
you<00:02:27.050> could<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:27.470> simply<00:02:28.010> set<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.430> what<00:02:29.180> you

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
you could just simply set the what you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.790 
you could just simply set the what you
would<00:02:29.480> be<00:02:29.630> getting<00:02:29.780> white<00:02:30.080> light<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.620> set

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
would be getting white light if you set

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.170 
would be getting white light if you set
it<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> same<00:02:31.310> temperature<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it to the same temperature that this is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.140 
it to the same temperature that this is
getting<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.200> also<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.920> if<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.700> do

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
getting and also you can if you you do

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.730 
getting and also you can if you you do
take<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> photograph<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.990> notice<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> colors

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
take a photograph you notice the colors

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.740 
take a photograph you notice the colors
a<00:02:36.770> little<00:02:36.920> off<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.880> change<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.360> white

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
a little off you can change the white

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.970 
a little off you can change the white
balance<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.440> if<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.680> want<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.860> get

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
balance on here if you want to get

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.680 
balance on here if you want to get
different<00:02:40.190> colors<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.850> has<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> fluorescent

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
different colors it has a fluorescent

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.170 
different colors it has a fluorescent
color<00:02:42.040> actual<00:02:43.040> sign<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.820> looks<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.150> a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
color actual sign on it it looks like a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.030 
color actual sign on it it looks like a
little<00:02:44.450> bar<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.080> got<00:02:45.230> some<00:02:45.440> some<00:02:45.800> bright

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
little bar and it's got some some bright

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.699 
little bar and it's got some some bright
marks<00:02:46.970> coming<00:02:47.300> out<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> indicate

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
marks coming out of it so to indicate

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.440 
marks coming out of it so to indicate
that<00:02:48.770> there<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.220> actually<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> glow<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.270> of

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
that there is actually a glow to it of

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.600 
that there is actually a glow to it of
light<00:02:50.630> but<00:02:51.560> what<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.739> usually<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.459> use

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
light but what I usually do is use

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.220 
light but what I usually do is use
Kelvin<00:02:52.820> temperatures<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.140> be

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
Kelvin temperatures because I like to be

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
precise about things I'm a very

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.660 
precise about things I'm a very
technical<00:02:56.330> shooter<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.560> lot<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.160> times<00:02:58.340> I've

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
technical shooter a lot of times I've

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.310 
technical shooter a lot of times I've
had<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.850> solid<00:02:59.390> background<00:02:59.989> I've<00:03:00.110> been<00:03:00.230> to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
had a solid background I've been to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.810 
had a solid background I've been to
Hallmark<00:03:00.500> Institute<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.160> Photography<00:03:01.280> where

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
Hallmark Institute of Photography where

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.180 
Hallmark Institute of Photography where
they<00:03:01.940> taught<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.900> basically<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:03.950> very

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
they taught you that basically it's very

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.430 
they taught you that basically it's very
very<00:03:04.790> important<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.360> get<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> solid<00:03:05.810> capture

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
very important to get a solid capture

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.500 
very important to get a solid capture
because<00:03:06.590> once<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.100> have<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.520> capture<00:03:08.060> you

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
because once you have that capture you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.940 
because once you have that capture you
have<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.900> information<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.800> can

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
have the information that you can

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.590 
have the information that you can
manipulate<00:03:10.160> if<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.730> chose<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.180> do<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.330> on

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
manipulate if you chose to do that on

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.140 
manipulate if you chose to do that on
the<00:03:11.690> computer<00:03:12.070> now<00:03:13.070> with<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.520> cameras<00:03:13.940> being

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
the computer now with the cameras being

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.759 
the computer now with the cameras being
as<00:03:14.330> good<00:03:14.510> as<00:03:14.600> they<00:03:14.750> are<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.170> I've<00:03:15.290> got<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> d3

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
as good as they are like I've got a d3

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.370 
as good as they are like I've got a d3
if<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.730> get<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.150> solid<00:03:17.420> capture<00:03:18.019> if<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.260> was

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
if I get that solid capture if I was

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.500 
if I get that solid capture if I was
taking<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.739> picture<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.160> sign<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.730> used<00:03:20.360> an

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
taking a picture of a sign and I used an

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.479 
taking a picture of a sign and I used an
aperture<00:03:20.840> say<00:03:21.170> five<00:03:21.440> six<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.100> got<00:03:22.280> that

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
aperture say five six and I got that

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.150 
aperture say five six and I got that
sign<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:22.760> really<00:03:23.269> crisp<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.900> there<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:25.070> then

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
sign just really crisp in there and then

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.620 
sign just really crisp in there and then
to<00:03:25.400> where<00:03:25.519> there<00:03:25.760> was<00:03:25.880> detailing<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.450> whole

to where there was detailing the whole

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.479 
to where there was detailing the whole
thing<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.110> got<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.350> exposure<00:03:27.739> right<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
thing and got the exposure right so the

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.280 
thing and got the exposure right so the
none<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.180> Sun<00:03:29.390> nothing<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.110> sign

none of the the Sun nothing in the sign

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.960 
none of the the Sun nothing in the sign

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
they do teach is that there is never

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.070 
they do teach is that there is never
anything<00:04:03.830> better<00:04:04.280> than<00:04:04.549> getting<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.630> actually

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
anything better than getting it actually

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.420 
anything better than getting it actually
getting<00:04:06.440> all<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.709> detail<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.190> getting<00:04:07.370> that

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
getting all that detail and getting that

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.490 
getting all that detail and getting that
information<00:04:07.579> in<00:04:08.180> camera<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.690> also<00:04:09.110> saves<00:04:09.350> you

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
information in camera and also saves you
