00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.689
 how about youtube guys in this 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.079
 I bring you this video in which 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.179
 we'll talk a little bit about the 7.1 jailbreak 

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:11.879
 understand this is a video cut 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.830
 informative about these jailbreak for 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.650
 that you do not do in traps of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.570
 other videos or become swindled 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 make an internal page to make it 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 to know let's start with this video what 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.349
 obviously you already know that in the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.199
 help and 7.1 day to perform public 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.970
 about a week or two ago and in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.360
 rumors that they have been very strong 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.670
 and in fact there are already theoretical not to the public 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.400
 but he is already being executed by a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.420
 libel but one of the jailbreak 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.550
 nation that is called there is snow 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.500
 h 8 snow as you say is one of the most 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 outstanding of what is the world of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 jobbik 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 the audience previously not now 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.860
 I have your click for the public that already 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 has supposedly is an iphone 4s with 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.580
 a jailbreak of 7.1 ios still not yet 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.440
 it is confirmed so is a shopkeeper is to have 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 but that we already have to see we already have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.619
 because he is very reliable and we have it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.960
 for a long time also 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.630
 previously another one of the joubert 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.300
 nation who are of the most as could 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.050
 say influential of what henrik is 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 let's see his his twitter who is 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.380
 windows 7 he uploaded a video in which 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.090
 showed the yo break in process 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 how he showed how they are seeing 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.140
 the jailbreak codes and in a 4 this one 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.750
 it was on a 4 on an iphone 4 showing the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.399
 process the jailbreak on an iphone 4 but 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 you have no idea obviously you already 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.619
 they will know that the jailbreak and syria are two 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.170
 very different things since you take 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.960
 it's just what exploits are and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.900
 all that is security and all the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 cases in the process and if only diaz 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.369
 is the application to download the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.030
 clicks and all that as an app store but 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.380
 obviously from the world of the jobbik and good 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 this the most important thing that I wanted them 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.850
 tell 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.530
 that there is already a jove for iphone 4 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.290
 is probably in process and for 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.550
 four times there are unfortunately for the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.930
 other devices like the iphone 55 s 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 we still do not have any 'break' but 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 obviously I upload the video when I 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.980
 we have but most of all I did this 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.400
 video so that you do not go to a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.030
 Internet page and the estafen or some 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.740
 another thing I also ask you to 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 subscribe to this channel that is my first 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.030
 video in which I'm going to upload 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.980
 previously I had another channel called 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.440
 rich blog and I still have it because if 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.910
 they want to check is in the description 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.090
 but I'm going to ask you to subscribe and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.010
 they like this video if it helps them or 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.110
 it even informs them of something not 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.970
 forget to like and subscribe 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.250

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.450
