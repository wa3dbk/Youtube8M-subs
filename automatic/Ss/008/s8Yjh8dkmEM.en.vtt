00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of flash on the control balls that's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
of flash on the control balls that's
just<00:00:30.000> from<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.810> that's<00:00:30.960> molded<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.920> if

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
just from the way that's molded and if

just from the way that's molded and if
you<00:00:32.340> were<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.820> attach<00:00:33.660> these<00:00:33.989> right<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.149> this

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you were to attach these right now this

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.780 
you were to attach these right now this
tail<00:00:36.989> pitch<00:00:37.320> slider<00:00:37.559> mechanism<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.760> is

tail pitch slider mechanism which is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.840 
tail pitch slider mechanism which is
right<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:39.960> extremely<00:00:40.620> stiff<00:00:41.070> now

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
right here would be extremely stiff now

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340 
right here would be extremely stiff now
this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.540> connected<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> tell

this is not connected to the tell
control<00:00:43.710> rod<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.760> slide<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
control rod I can slide it back and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.209 
control rod I can slide it back and
forth<00:00:45.890> very<00:00:46.890> easy<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:48.860> 2-5<00:00:49.860> picked<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
forth very easy very 2-5 picked up the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
forth very easy very 2-5 picked up the
helicopter<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.059> leaned<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> over<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
helicopter and leaned it over on the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
helicopter and leaned it over on the
side<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.860> would<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.250> fall<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:54.030> side<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
side it would just fall from side to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.779 
side it would just fall from side to
side<00:00:54.620> if<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.739> clip<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
side if I clip this on right now it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
side if I clip this on right now it
would<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.030> extremely<00:00:57.809> tight<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.100> just

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
would be extremely tight so I'm just

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
would be extremely tight so I'm just
going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.399> show<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> make

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
going to show you what I do to make

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.000 
going to show you what I do to make
these<00:01:00.899> ultra<00:01:01.559> smooth<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:04.010> very

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
these ultra smooth this is just a very

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.570 
these ultra smooth this is just a very
kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.150> fine<00:01:06.450> file<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.619> coarse<00:01:08.310> grit

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
kind of fine file it's not coarse grit

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
kind of fine file it's not coarse grit
or<00:01:08.700> anything<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.140> just<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> few

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
or anything like that just take a few

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:20.090 
or anything like that just take a few
little

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 

once<00:01:20.580> again<00:01:20.760> this<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.300> very<00:01:21.930> fine<00:01:22.320> file<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
once again this is a very fine file I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.290 
once again this is a very fine file I
mean<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.670> wouldn't<00:01:23.910> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
mean if you wouldn't want to do this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.590 
mean if you wouldn't want to do this
with<00:01:24.510> a<00:01:24.920> medium<00:01:26.090> definitely<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.120> course<00:01:27.420> but

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
with a medium definitely a course but

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
with a medium definitely a course but
different<00:01:27.900> not<00:01:28.710> even<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.980> medium<00:01:29.340> grit<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
different not even a medium grit you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.920 
different not even a medium grit you
would<00:01:30.510> actually<00:01:31.430> sand<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:32.580> flat<00:01:33.060> spots<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
would actually sand off flat spots so I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
would actually sand off flat spots so I
just<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.100> flash

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
just want to get just that little flash

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.460 
just want to get just that little flash
off<00:01:35.760> there

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
off there

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.900 
off there
I'll<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> fine<00:01:39.170> grit<00:01:40.170> nail<00:01:40.410> file

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
I'll use the fine grit nail file

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.910 
I'll use the fine grit nail file
this<00:01:42.270> one's<00:01:42.450> foam<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.380> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> gives<00:01:43.800> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
this one's foam so it kind of gives a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.150 
this one's foam so it kind of gives a
little<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.620> that<00:01:46.830> way<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.979> can

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
little bit and you know that way you can

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.320 
little bit and you know that way you can
kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.370> put<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.580> little<00:01:47.790> pressure<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.270> not

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
kind of put a little pressure and not

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.950 
kind of put a little pressure and not
worry<00:01:48.540> about<00:01:48.920> ruining<00:01:49.920> ruining<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.030> geometry

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
worry about ruining ruining the geometry

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
worry about ruining ruining the geometry
on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> control<00:01:52.650> ball<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.250> that's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
on the control ball so that one that's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.609 
on the control ball so that one that's
smooth<00:01:57.590> do<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> same<00:01:58.890> thing<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> side

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.109 

you<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.800> it<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.310> both<00:02:05.520> sides<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.940> all

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
you get it all get both sides get all

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:19.460 
you get it all get both sides get all
the<00:02:06.300> way<00:02:06.390> around<00:02:06.660> there

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.940 

that's<00:02:19.980> smooth<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.370> well<00:02:20.550> okay<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.830> that's<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that's smooth as well okay so that's the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.100 
that's smooth as well okay so that's the
first<00:02:23.160> step<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.550> done<00:02:23.750> make<00:02:24.750> sure<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
first step that's done make sure you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.130 
first step that's done make sure you
have<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.760> tail<00:02:26.760> blade<00:02:27.060> grips<00:02:27.420> oriented<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
have the tail blade grips oriented the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.330
