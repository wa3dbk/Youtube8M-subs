00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello people welcome once again to one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.880
 for everyone good I'm here again in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.160
 the beach of victory holy spirit 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.320
 Well today is a spectacular day but 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.509
 continues to be windy days and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.139
 today we are going to teach to do from here a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.699
 survival whistle with a can of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.769
 aluminum will cover the brand so that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.439
 look that was Guarana Antarctica 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.470
 we're going to need the can and we're going to 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.359
 also need a scissors the rest 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 we are going to do everything to eye because it is 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.880
 very very easy to do first we're going to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.470
 have to start cutting a strip 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.330
 everything along is going to be a 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.690
 aluminum tape that has to be 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.820
 approximately one and a half centimeters 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 to leave it we have cut the best 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.720
 possible way to eye we will not have 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.760
 what to go 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.470
 giving a circular shape here we are going to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.950
 have to go round talking about 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.950
 this way 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.420
 and more or less there 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.260
 where would you touch where you would meet 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.160
 and we're going to have to double it 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160
 in this way 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.990
 this is going to right now 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.630
 we are closing a bit the best way 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.090
 that where deformed 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.490
 and now we are going to leave approximately one 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.360
 a finger and a half more or less here 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.790
 to cut to find a little more we are going to 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.140
 give two of two 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.120
 but let's leave it 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.120
 let's cut more or less there are 3 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.950
 and now with this here we are going to do it 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 is to place here in this way so let's go 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.760
 to bend 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.470
 Bend 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.470
 we cut what's left here 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.260
 we are doing this efe 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.260
 and from here we are also going to double 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.170
 and there we are going to form the peak. 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.170
 to have to open a little 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.310
 and this would be the whistle already finished if 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.750
 we had to start with the place because 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.850
 began to get a lot of people to the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.260
 beach they started to put loud music 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.750
 well I had to go from there because I 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.730
 I was very embarrassed and because I could not 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.100
 record a lot there but we reach it to 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.550
 finish earlier and this would be how you 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.560
 uses good this would be the peak by 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.540
 this side we have the peak and for this 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.600
 side we have the part of the whistle that the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.790
 we are going to have to finish forming with 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.740
 the fingers with the thumb and with the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.050
 index finger in this way let's take 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.120
 well and we are going to give you the form so that 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.810
 the slot having all occur 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.310
 the whistles in this place there we're going to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.960
 listen to see now how it sounds they're going to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.420
 have to regulate if it does not sound 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.740
 before closing by opening the slot 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.740
 that which is here we are going to blow 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.160
 or if 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.160
 it sounds pretty loud 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.430
 auto look at me there they think I'm 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.430
 making a turn 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.950
 terrific not to do the eyes I think 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.569
 that went pretty well I hope there's 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.390
 liked and followed video like these 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.390
 Then go to one page for everything 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.819
 I have another video that is also for 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.400
 do this so do or what how 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.980
 do with a sorbet let's teach 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.659
 we are also here giving back we are 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.700
 trying to look for simple ideas that 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.459
 we can make sure we do not fall behind 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.709
 we can fulfill them and they could not be 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.560
 leave if you want also here below 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.780
 you can go see if you like these 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.459
 types of creations so we have something 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.439
 much more complex than the little boat 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.819
 that we're going to this side and this side 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.189
 I'm going to leave you something that is 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.560
 interesting that is how to do the 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.000
 Lanchita flexible straws for it 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.189
 because suddenly in all 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.260
 materials this is hard to find 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.909
 Flexible drinking straw good on this side you 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.560
 let's leave a simple short video 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.480
 where we teach an easy way to 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.060
 get out of trouble and be able to make the straw 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.699
 flexible for the boat little good 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.500
 like favorite to give I like to comment 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.889
 that is good because he does not vote that 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.889
 comment
