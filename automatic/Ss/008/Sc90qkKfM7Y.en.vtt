00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it has a hold level of two if that means

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.460 
it has a hold level of two if that means
anything<00:00:25.949> um<00:00:27.230> but<00:00:28.230> these<00:00:28.560> are<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:29.130> results<00:00:30.470> as

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
anything um but these are my results as

anything um but these are my results as
you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.969> hair<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:34.320> defined

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.959 

and<00:00:38.300> it's<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.200> pliable<00:00:41.070> um<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.850> think

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and it's very like pliable um I think

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.139 
and it's very like pliable um I think
that<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.219> little<00:00:44.579> bit<00:00:44.730> more<00:00:44.910> movement

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that this has a little bit more movement

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.310 
that this has a little bit more movement
than<00:00:46.219> eco<00:00:47.219> styler<00:00:47.520> gel<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:49.110> seems<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
than eco styler gel it actually seems to

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.639 
than eco styler gel it actually seems to
have<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.680> guess<00:00:53.250> less<00:00:53.879> hold<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.289> or

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have I guess less hold but the the or

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.069 
have I guess less hold but the the or
not<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.449> less<00:00:57.660> whole<00:00:57.870> but

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
not I don't know if it's less whole but

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.510 
not I don't know if it's less whole but
it's<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> different<00:00:58.559> type<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> hold<00:00:59.250> it's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it's like a different type of hold it's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's like a different type of hold it's
not<00:00:59.730> quite<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.420> strong<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.010> put<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.340> on

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
not quite as strong when you put this on

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.679 
not quite as strong when you put this on
it<00:01:03.329> feels<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> moose<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.559> doesn't<00:01:05.070> feel

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
it feels like a moose it doesn't feel

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
it feels like a moose it doesn't feel
tacky<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.470> comparatively<00:01:08.159> speaking

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
tacky at all and comparatively speaking

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.359 
tacky at all and comparatively speaking
even<00:01:09.330> though<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> always<00:01:10.380> felt<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.740> echo<00:01:11.159> goes

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
even though I always felt like echo goes

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.090 
even though I always felt like echo goes
on<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:11.729> clean<00:01:12.920> comparatively<00:01:13.920> speaking

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
on really clean comparatively speaking

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.620 
on really clean comparatively speaking
this<00:01:14.580> goes<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.320> even<00:01:16.320> cleaner<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.040> lighter

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
this goes on even cleaner and lighter

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
this goes on even cleaner and lighter
it's<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> result<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.890> hair

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it's like you see the result your hair

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480 
it's like you see the result your hair
but<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.670> feel<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:22.500> heavy<00:01:22.860> weighted

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
but you don't feel this heavy weighted

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.210 
but you don't feel this heavy weighted
gel<00:01:24.240> feeling<00:01:24.770> while<00:01:25.770> you're<00:01:25.799> letting<00:01:26.130> your

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
gel feeling while you're letting your

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
gel feeling while you're letting your
here<00:01:26.640> airdrie<00:01:27.330> um<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.900> break<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> up

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
here airdrie um I do have to break it up

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.310 
here airdrie um I do have to break it up
the<00:01:31.229> same<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.920> had<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> echo<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the same way I had to do the echo the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.039 
the same way I had to do the echo the
difference<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> usually<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.150> pull<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
difference is I I usually just pull it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
difference is I I usually just pull it
like<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:38.630> instead<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:41.479> running<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> from

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
like this instead of running it from

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.580 
like this instead of running it from
back<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.079> front<00:01:43.259> um<00:01:44.090> mainly<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.380> area

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
back to front um mainly because the area

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.310 
back to front um mainly because the area
where<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.159> feel<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> gel<00:01:48.630> irritates<00:01:49.140> me

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
where I feel that the gel irritates me

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.399 
where I feel that the gel irritates me
the<00:01:49.439> most<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.130> ends<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.420> hate<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.170> fact

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the most is on my ends I hate the fact

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.209 
the most is on my ends I hate the fact
that<00:01:52.710> sometimes<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:54.119> ends<00:01:54.329> feel<00:01:54.750> stiff<00:01:55.259> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
that sometimes my ends feel stiff so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.899 
that sometimes my ends feel stiff so
that<00:01:56.369> helps<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.640> see

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that helps with that but you can see

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.910 
that helps with that but you can see
it's<00:02:00.899> very<00:02:01.259> soft<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.369> doesn't<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.909> feel

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
it's very soft it doesn't really feel

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's very soft it doesn't really feel
moisturized<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.000> doesn't<00:02:06.299> feel<00:02:06.329> dry

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
moisturized but it doesn't feel dry

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.310 
moisturized but it doesn't feel dry

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.430 
that um oil might hear don't mix all
that<00:02:28.960> well<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:31.390> still<00:02:31.660> kind<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:31.990> breaking

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that well so it's still kind of breaking

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.090 
that well so it's still kind of breaking
up<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:34.270> curls<00:02:34.570> more<00:02:35.200> than<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.920> would

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
up the curls more than they would

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.410 
up the curls more than they would
normally<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.640> broken<00:02:37.030> up<00:02:37.120> because<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.370> oil

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
normally be broken up because of the oil

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.950 
normally be broken up because of the oil
so<00:02:40.650> anyway<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.680> mean<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.220> give<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.000> product<00:02:43.330> two

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
so anyway I mean I give this product two

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.070 
so anyway I mean I give this product two
thumbs<00:02:44.260> up<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:45.400> only<00:02:45.700> thing<00:02:45.910> well<00:02:46.120> maybe<00:02:46.750> one

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
thumbs up the only thing well maybe one

thumbs up the only thing well maybe one
Felmy<00:02:47.470> one<00:02:47.950> thumb<00:02:48.160> up<00:02:48.310> because<00:02:48.850> I'm<00:02:49.360> used<00:02:49.720> to

echo<00:02:53.590> styler<00:02:53.890> gel<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:57.750> six<00:02:58.750> ounces<00:02:59.140> that

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
echo styler gel this is six ounces that

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.890 
echo styler gel this is six ounces that
was<00:03:00.190> five<00:03:00.430> dollars<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.910> know<00:03:04.090> I'm<00:03:04.510> gonna

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
was five dollars so you know I'm gonna

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.900 
was five dollars so you know I'm gonna
say<00:03:05.200> I've<00:03:05.530> used<00:03:06.990> half<00:03:07.990> of<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.710> i've<00:03:09.340> been

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
say I've used half of it and i've been

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.440 
say I've used half of it and i've been
using<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.360> on<00:03:10.540> my<00:03:10.660> hair<00:03:10.900> for<00:03:11.140> about<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.320> week

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
using this on my hair for about a week

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.960 
using this on my hair for about a week
so<00:03:13.470> that's<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> downside<00:03:14.860> i<00:03:15.220> mean<00:03:15.580> maybe<00:03:15.730> they

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
so that's the downside i mean maybe they

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.560 
so that's the downside i mean maybe they
have<00:03:16.209> bigger<00:03:17.580> containers<00:03:18.580> that<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.880> haven't

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
have bigger containers that I haven't

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.240 
have bigger containers that I haven't
seen<00:03:19.750> i'd<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.110> willing<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.410> pay<00:03:20.500> ten<00:03:20.830> dollars

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
seen i'd be willing to pay ten dollars

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.960 
seen i'd be willing to pay ten dollars
for<00:03:21.790> maybe<00:03:22.690> three<00:03:22.930> times<00:03:23.110> this<00:03:23.380> amount<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.580> i'm

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
for maybe three times this amount so i'm

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.220 
for maybe three times this amount so i'm
going<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.150> do<00:03:25.270> some<00:03:25.480> investigating<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.080> see

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
going to do some investigating and see

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.680 
going to do some investigating and see
if<00:03:26.320> i<00:03:26.410> can<00:03:26.560> find<00:03:26.770> this<00:03:27.010> because<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:28.030> think<00:03:28.600> I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
if i can find this because I I think I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.620 
if i can find this because I I think I
really<00:03:29.020> like<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:30.340> shine<00:03:30.580> factor<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.300> very

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
really like it the shine factor is very

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.680 
really like it the shine factor is very
similar<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.110> echo<00:03:33.270> sometimes<00:03:34.270> I'll<00:03:34.450> find

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
similar to echo sometimes I'll find

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.720 
similar to echo sometimes I'll find
other<00:03:34.900> jealous<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.410> like<00:03:35.800> but<00:03:36.160> they<00:03:36.370> put

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
other jealous that I like but they put

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.509 
other jealous that I like but they put
like<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> dull<00:03:37.330> residue<00:03:37.870> or<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> haze<00:03:39.190> over

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
like a dull residue or like a haze over

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.810 
like a dull residue or like a haze over
my<00:03:39.790> hair<00:03:40.000> or<00:03:40.120> something<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:41.739> leaves<00:03:42.550> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
my hair or something this leaves the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.220 
my hair or something this leaves the
hair<00:03:43.030> looking<00:03:43.769> very<00:03:44.769> clean<00:03:45.100> very<00:03:45.430> natural<00:03:46.230> it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
hair looking very clean very natural it

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.710 
hair looking very clean very natural it
leaves<00:03:47.380> like<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.709> sheen<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:52.540> probably

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
leaves like a sheen on it it probably

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.720 
leaves like a sheen on it it probably
looks<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.320> little<00:03:53.470> more<00:03:53.680> natural<00:03:54.130> actually

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
looks a little more natural actually

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.509 
looks a little more natural actually
then<00:03:54.970> echo<00:03:55.450> because<00:03:55.870> echo<00:03:56.320> kind<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.280> gives<00:03:57.459> you

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
then echo because echo kind of gives you

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.740 
then echo because echo kind of gives you
that<00:03:58.170> wet<00:03:59.170> look<00:04:00.989> this<00:04:01.989> gives<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:03.100> shine<00:04:04.000> but

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
see the results I don't know if my hair

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.860 
see the results I don't know if my hair
grew<00:04:19.949> in<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.489> month<00:04:20.759> that<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.299> had<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
grew in that month that I had it in the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.600 
grew in that month that I had it in the
ponytail<00:04:22.259> I<00:04:22.500> mean<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.740> literally<00:04:23.160> did<00:04:23.460> nothing

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
ponytail I mean I literally did nothing

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.670 
ponytail I mean I literally did nothing
except<00:04:24.150> like<00:04:24.300> smooth<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.750> edges<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.139> pull<00:04:25.650> it

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
except like smooth the edges and pull it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.689 
except like smooth the edges and pull it
back<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.009> ponytail<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:29.100> maybe<00:04:29.280> my<00:04:29.430> hair<00:04:29.669> a

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
back in a ponytail so maybe my hair a

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.029 
back in a ponytail so maybe my hair a
little<00:04:30.060> bit<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.509> just<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.350> hope<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.860> can

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
little bit it's just that I hope you can

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.340 
little bit it's just that I hope you can
see<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:34.310> was<00:04:35.310> minimal<00:04:35.729> shrinkage<00:04:36.259> you<00:04:37.259> know

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
see it was minimal shrinkage you know

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.900 
see it was minimal shrinkage you know
what<00:04:37.470> I'm<00:04:37.560> saying<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:38.100> normally<00:04:38.729> I<00:04:38.759> get<00:04:38.880> a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
what I'm saying like normally I get a

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.370 
what I'm saying like normally I get a
little<00:04:39.060> bit<00:04:39.240> more<00:04:39.360> shrinkage<00:04:39.750> than<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.080> but

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
little bit more shrinkage than this but

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.939 
little bit more shrinkage than this but
um<00:04:41.660> there's<00:04:42.660> minimal<00:04:42.900> shrinkage<00:04:43.259> I<00:04:43.620> mean<00:04:43.800> it's

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
um there's minimal shrinkage I mean it's

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.740 
um there's minimal shrinkage I mean it's
pretty<00:04:44.160> much<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.430> same<00:04:44.759> length<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.210> was<00:04:45.389> when

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
pretty much the same length it was when

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.629 
pretty much the same length it was when
it<00:04:45.780> was<00:04:45.930> wet<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.440> may<00:04:47.009> have<00:04:47.250> been<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:48.289> don't<00:04:49.289> know

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639
