doesn't work on the NES which is a big

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.910 
doesn't work on the NES which is a big
problem<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.469> all<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.829> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
problem because first of all you have to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
problem because first of all you have to
kind<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> force<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> games<00:01:14.700> into<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.060> machine

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
kind of force the games into the machine

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.599 
kind of force the games into the machine
then<00:01:16.020> pulling<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.649> out<00:01:16.859> it<00:01:17.100> feels<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.490> I'm

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
then pulling them out it feels like I'm

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.700 
then pulling them out it feels like I'm
wrecking<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> pins<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.020> I've<00:01:19.560> actually

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
wrecking the pins and I've actually

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.789 
wrecking the pins and I've actually
looked<00:01:20.219> inside<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.899> NES<00:01:21.899> pins<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.659> upon

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
looked inside the NES pins and upon

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
looked inside the NES pins and upon
further<00:01:25.799> inspection<00:01:26.249> I've<00:01:26.999> noticed<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
further inspection I've noticed that the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.359 
further inspection I've noticed that the
pins<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> actually<00:01:28.259> bending<00:01:28.679> because<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
pins are actually bending because of the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.620 
pins are actually bending because of the
force<00:01:29.609> will<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.789> pulling<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> out

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.860 
cables that come with it then it comes
with<00:02:12.440> an<00:02:12.800> NES<00:02:13.220> controller<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:14.090> hyper<00:02:14.390> can<00:02:14.630> brand

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
with an NES controller a hyper can brand

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.420 
with an NES controller a hyper can brand
that's<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.560> piece<00:02:15.710> of<00:02:15.830> garbage

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
that's a piece of garbage

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.230 
that's a piece of garbage
the<00:02:16.820> buttons<00:02:17.150> are<00:02:17.420> too<00:02:18.350> raised<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:19.430> push<00:02:19.940> they

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
the buttons are too raised to push they

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.610 
the buttons are too raised to push they
feel<00:02:20.420> really<00:02:20.870> weird<00:02:21.020> if<00:02:21.140> you've<00:02:21.260> played<00:02:21.410> with

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
feel really weird if you've played with

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.490 
feel really weird if you've played with
actual<00:02:21.890> NES<00:02:22.370> controller<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.140> actual

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
actual NES controller and on the actual

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.050 
actual NES controller and on the actual
d-pad<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.280> hit<00:02:25.430> down

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
d-pad if you hit down

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.970 
d-pad if you hit down
it<00:02:26.270> often<00:02:26.540> barely<00:02:27.140> recognizes<00:02:27.830> you're

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
it often barely recognizes you're

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.180 
it often barely recognizes you're
hitting<00:02:28.250> down<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.390> will<00:02:29.540> um<00:02:30.190> it'll

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
hitting down so it will um it'll

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.380 
hitting down so it will um it'll
actually<00:02:31.340> think<00:02:31.700> you're<00:02:31.820> hitting<00:02:31.940> left<00:02:32.240> or

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
actually think you're hitting left or

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.490 
actually think you're hitting left or
right<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> huge<00:02:34.460> issue<00:02:35.500> when

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
right so that is a huge issue when

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.620 
right so that is a huge issue when
playing<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.160> Mario<00:02:37.520> for<00:02:37.670> instance<00:02:37.970> same

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
playing like Mario for instance same

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.070 
playing like Mario for instance same
with<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:39.340> SNES<00:02:40.340> controller<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.270> pretty

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
with the SNES controller it's pretty

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.910 
with the SNES controller it's pretty
much<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.500> same

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
much the same

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.670 
much the same
I've<00:02:43.150> played<00:02:44.150> SNES<00:02:44.900> before<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.500> doesn't

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
I've played SNES before and it doesn't

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.010 
I've played SNES before and it doesn't
feel<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:47.300> same<00:02:47.540> there<00:02:47.720> aren't<00:02:47.900> as<00:02:47.990> many

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
feel like the same there aren't as many

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.470 
feel like the same there aren't as many
issues<00:02:48.350> with<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.920> d-pad<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:50.330> just

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
issues with the d-pad but it just

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.420 
issues with the d-pad but it just
doesn't<00:02:50.660> feel<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.900> same<00:02:51.170> but<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:51.560> sure<00:02:52.070> look

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
doesn't feel the same but this sure look

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.490 
doesn't feel the same but this sure look
awesome<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:53.330> basically<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.930> left<00:02:54.200> side

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
awesome it's basically on the left side

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.460 
awesome it's basically on the left side
of<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.680> console<00:02:55.160> over<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:56.300> there<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.840> an<00:02:56.990> NES

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
of the console over here there is an NES

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.960 
of the console over here there is an NES
and<00:02:57.500> SNES<00:02:58.870> controller<00:02:59.950> connection<00:03:00.970> thing

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and SNES controller connection thing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.760 
and SNES controller connection thing
where<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.690> can<00:03:02.840> plug<00:03:03.020> in<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.320> first<00:03:03.530> player

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
where you can plug in the first player

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.560 
where you can plug in the first player
and<00:03:04.070> on<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:04.550> side<00:03:04.790> there's<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> second

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
and on the right side there's a second

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.920 
and on the right side there's a second
player<00:03:06.230> for<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.890> SNES<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.400> NES<00:03:07.880> what<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.720> wish

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
player for the SNES and NES what I wish

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.510 
player for the SNES and NES what I wish
they<00:03:09.110> would<00:03:09.320> have<00:03:09.410> done<00:03:09.560> for<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.830> NES<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.280> put

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
they would have done for the NES is put

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.890 
they would have done for the NES is put
four<00:03:10.850> because<00:03:11.330> then<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.570> wouldn't<00:03:11.750> have

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
four because then you wouldn't have

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.280 
four because then you wouldn't have
needed<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.410> buy<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.770> four<00:03:13.400> player<00:03:14.290> adapter

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
needed to buy the four player adapter

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.050 
needed to buy the four player adapter
but<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.800> guess<00:03:16.100> I'm<00:03:16.310> still<00:03:16.520> gonna<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:16.940> buy

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
but I guess I'm still gonna have to buy

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.780 
but I guess I'm still gonna have to buy
that<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.390> play<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:17.750> players<00:03:18.050> but<00:03:18.430> that's<00:03:19.430> okay

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that to play for players but that's okay

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.990 
that to play for players but that's okay
because<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.540> actually<00:03:20.840> takes<00:03:21.640> original<00:03:22.640> NES

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
because this actually takes original NES

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.850 
because this actually takes original NES
controllers<00:03:23.480> which<00:03:23.660> is<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:24.020> use<00:03:24.350> on<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.680> I

that's really good is um as I said
before<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.370> controllers<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.300> just<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.630> look

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
before the controllers and just to look

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.229 
before the controllers and just to look
at<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.110> machine<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.220> looks<00:03:49.459> awesome<00:03:50.060> it

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
at the machine and looks awesome it

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.620 
at the machine and looks awesome it
resembles<00:03:50.690> an<00:03:50.930> SNES<00:03:51.769> in<00:03:52.190> my<00:03:52.370> opinion<00:03:52.850> with<00:03:53.060> you

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630

resembles an SNES in my opinion with you
know<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> two<00:03:54.019> sections<00:03:54.560> here<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.100> then<00:03:55.190> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
know the two sections here and then the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.850 
know the two sections here and then the
top<00:03:56.030> loader<00:03:56.269> cartridge<00:03:56.840> that's<00:03:57.560> another

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
top loader cartridge that's another

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.410 
top loader cartridge that's another
thing<00:03:58.100> about<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.340> NES<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.790> really<00:03:59.030> like<00:03:59.180> it's<00:03:59.330> a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
thing about the NES I really like it's a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.750 
thing about the NES I really like it's a
top<00:03:59.600> loader<00:03:59.870> NES

um<00:04:00.849> but<00:04:01.599> it's<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.810> lot<00:04:01.989> easier<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.379> get<00:04:02.620> at<00:04:02.860> the

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
um but it's a lot easier to get at the

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.069 
um but it's a lot easier to get at the
pins<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.939> clean<00:04:04.180> them<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.599> it's<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.870> top

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
loader and it also just makes way more

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.059

sense<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.420> have<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.659> top<00:04:07.930> loading<00:04:08.230> then<00:04:08.950> your

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
sense to have a top loading then your

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.679 
sense to have a top loading then your
game<00:04:09.250> doesn't<00:04:09.579> get<00:04:09.670> stuck<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.209> console

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
game doesn't get stuck in the console

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.300 
game doesn't get stuck in the console
and<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.810> have<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.019> unscrew<00:04:11.170> everything<00:04:11.799> it's

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
and you have to unscrew everything it's

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.620 
and you have to unscrew everything it's
just<00:04:12.459> easier<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:13.510> looks<00:04:13.840> nicer<00:04:14.349> yes

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630
