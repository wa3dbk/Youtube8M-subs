this video I just wanted to explain a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.210 
this video I just wanted to explain a
little<00:00:06.690> bit<00:00:06.990> about<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.500> Impossible<00:00:08.189> Project

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
little bit about the Impossible Project

little bit about the Impossible Project
for<00:00:08.610> octone<00:00:09.530> about<00:00:10.530> what<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.759> does

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
for octone about what it is what it does

for octone about what it is what it does
and<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.780> install<00:00:12.990> one<00:00:13.410> properly<00:00:13.889> if<00:00:14.099> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
and how to install one properly if you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.230 
and how to install one properly if you
want<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> buy<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.130> own<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.670> Polaroid

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
want to buy one so if you own a Polaroid

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.349 
want to buy one so if you own a Polaroid
600<00:00:18.570> camera<00:00:19.730> it<00:00:20.730> doesn't<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
600 camera it doesn't have the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.120 
600 camera it doesn't have the
impossible<00:00:21.810> project<00:00:22.109> frog<00:00:22.320> tongue<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:23.010> may

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
impossible project frog tongue you may

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.420 
impossible project frog tongue you may
have<00:00:23.310> noticed<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.850> little<00:00:24.750> plastic<00:00:25.710> tongue

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
have noticed the little plastic tongue

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.790 
have noticed the little plastic tongue
that<00:00:27.090> flicks<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.539> over<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> image<00:00:28.260> when

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that flicks out over the image when

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.089 
that flicks out over the image when
you're<00:00:29.250> filming<00:00:29.519> jacks<00:00:30.260> now<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.800> happens

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you're filming jacks now it all happens

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
you're filming jacks now it all happens
very<00:00:32.219> quickly<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.820> don't<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.120> alarmed<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
very quickly so don't be alarmed if you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.810 
very quickly so don't be alarmed if you
haven't<00:00:34.380> noticed<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> happened<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.370> pretty

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
haven't noticed this happened but pretty

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.700 
haven't noticed this happened but pretty
much<00:00:35.969> what<00:00:36.180> happens<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> little<00:00:37.110> piece<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
much what happens is a little piece of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490 
much what happens is a little piece of
plastic<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.760> Rumble<00:00:39.210> out<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.200> image

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
plastic will Rumble out as you image

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
plastic will Rumble out as you image
each<00:00:40.649> X<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.610> rejects<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> whole<00:00:42.210> way

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
each X and as it rejects the whole way

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.100 
each X and as it rejects the whole way
it'll<00:00:42.600> quickly<00:00:42.780> snap<00:00:43.440> back<00:00:43.649> inside<00:00:44.329> now<00:00:45.329> back

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it'll quickly snap back inside now back

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
it'll quickly snap back inside now back
in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> day<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.739> Polaroid<00:00:47.340> still<00:00:47.610> made<00:00:47.760> film

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
in the day when Polaroid still made film

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.270 
in the day when Polaroid still made film
the<00:00:48.629> film<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.140> light-sensitive<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the film was light-sensitive for the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
the film was light-sensitive for the
first<00:00:50.489> few<00:00:50.700> milliseconds<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
first few milliseconds and so as the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
first few milliseconds and so as the
film<00:00:52.860> ejected<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> needs<00:00:53.730> something<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
film ejected it needs something it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.250 
film ejected it needs something it
needed<00:00:54.660> something<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.110> shield<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> from<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> lot

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
needed something to shield it from a lot

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.310 
needed something to shield it from a lot
after<00:00:58.260> those<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:58.890> few<00:00:59.039> milliseconds<00:00:59.340> a

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
after those first few milliseconds a

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
after those first few milliseconds a
layer<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.590> chemicals<00:01:02.309> would<00:01:02.550> spread<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.149> over

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
layer of chemicals would spread out over

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.070 
layer of chemicals would spread out over
the<00:01:04.019> film<00:01:04.260> emulsion<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.330> help

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the film emulsion and actually then help

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.740 
the film emulsion and actually then help
shield<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> sunlight<00:01:08.479> but<00:01:09.479> until

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
shield it from the sunlight but until

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
shield it from the sunlight but until
those<00:01:09.900> chemicals<00:01:10.470> were<00:01:10.590> active<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.310> needed

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
those chemicals were active it needed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.390 
those chemicals were active it needed
that<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.720> plastic<00:01:12.960> tongue<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that little bit of plastic tongue just

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.469 
that little bit of plastic tongue just
to<00:01:14.490> go<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.640> over<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> top

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to go out over the top

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.999 
to go out over the top
otherwise<00:01:15.930> he<00:01:16.170> image<00:01:16.439> would<00:01:16.619> end<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.860> looking

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
otherwise he image would end up looking

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.190 
otherwise he image would end up looking
very<00:01:17.670> washed<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> were<00:01:18.689> shooting<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
very washed out if you were shooting in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
very washed out if you were shooting in
broad<00:01:19.619> daylight<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> film<00:01:20.970> would

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
broad daylight because the film would

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
broad daylight because the film would
become<00:01:21.360> overexposed<00:01:22.130> now<00:01:23.130> fast<00:01:23.729> forward<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
become overexposed now fast forward to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.469 
become overexposed now fast forward to
these<00:01:24.960> days<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.759> film<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> being<00:01:27.090> made<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.420> The

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
these days and film is being made by The

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
these days and film is being made by The
Impossible<00:01:27.780> Project<00:01:28.080> now

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
Impossible Project now

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
Impossible Project now
long<00:01:29.340> story<00:01:29.610> short<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:30.329> Impossible<00:01:30.900> Project

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
long story short when Impossible Project

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
long story short when Impossible Project
took<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.590> Polaroids<00:01:32.220> old<00:01:32.369> factory<00:01:32.820> they

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
took over Polaroids old factory they

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719 
took over Polaroids old factory they
needed<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> start<00:01:33.930> entirely<00:01:34.500> from<00:01:34.829> scratch<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
needed to start entirely from scratch so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
needed to start entirely from scratch so
this<00:01:35.880> meant<00:01:36.119> making<00:01:36.329> new<00:01:36.900> film<00:01:37.140> emulsion<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this meant making new film emulsion and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.609 
this meant making new film emulsion and
new<00:01:37.950> developing<00:01:38.460> chemicals<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> film

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
new developing chemicals for the film

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
new developing chemicals for the film
now<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:41.100> first<00:01:41.400> few<00:01:41.610> batches<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.180> films

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
now these first few batches of films

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
now these first few batches of films
didn't<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.799> protective<00:01:44.189> chemical

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
didn't have that protective chemical

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
didn't have that protective chemical
laya<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.180> Polaroids<00:01:45.540> film<00:01:46.049> does<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.860> means

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
laya the Polaroids film does this means

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
laya the Polaroids film does this means
that<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:48.149> were<00:01:48.210> ejected<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that as they were ejected from the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280 
that as they were ejected from the
camera<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.729> film<00:01:50.880> needed<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.079> shielded

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
camera the film needed to be shielded

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.469 
camera the film needed to be shielded
from<00:01:52.590> life<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.490> time<00:01:53.759> while<00:01:54.299> it

developed or else it would get washed

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280

out<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:57.000> meant<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> original<00:01:58.049> tongues

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
out this meant that the original tongues

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.370 
out this meant that the original tongues
on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> cameras<00:01:58.979> simply<00:01:59.610> weren't<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
on the cameras simply weren't going to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.569 
on the cameras simply weren't going to
cut<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> mustard<00:02:01.890> they're<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.490> I'm

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
cut the mustard they're just what I'm

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.010 
cut the mustard they're just what I'm
going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> job<00:02:03.180> properly<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
going to do the job properly and so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.589 
going to do the job properly and so
something<00:02:07.020> needed<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.099> done<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:09.119> lot<00:02:09.450> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
something needed to be done a lot of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
something needed to be done a lot of
people<00:02:09.810> got<00:02:09.899> around<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.470> by<00:02:10.590> holding<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
people got around and just by holding it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.870 
people got around and just by holding it
hands<00:02:11.250> over<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.849> shield<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
hands over to shield it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.220 
hands over to shield it
still<00:02:13.090> wasn't<00:02:13.330> very<00:02:13.600> effective<00:02:14.050> so

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
still wasn't very effective so

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.130 
still wasn't very effective so
impossible<00:02:14.770> project<00:02:15.460> came<00:02:15.760> up<00:02:15.910> with<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.480> longer

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
impossible project came up with a longer

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.500 
impossible project came up with a longer
version<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.920> frog<00:02:18.130> tongue<00:02:18.340> which<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
version of the frog tongue which as it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.360 
version of the frog tongue which as it
rolled<00:02:19.720> out<00:02:19.960> over<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.350> film<00:02:20.560> would<00:02:21.040> stay

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
rolled out over the film would stay

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.090 
rolled out over the film would stay
there<00:02:21.610> oh<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.380> get<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.770> tongue

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
there oh and so if I just get the tongue

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.690 
there oh and so if I just get the tongue
out<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:25.000> show<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.270> if<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.630> wants<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.190> head<00:02:27.190> so

as<00:02:27.970> your<00:02:28.450> film<00:02:28.690> would<00:02:28.840> eject<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:30.010> little

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
as your film would eject this little

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.130 
as your film would eject this little
plastic<00:02:30.490> tongue<00:02:30.970> would<00:02:31.180> literally<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.870> roll

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
plastic tongue would literally just roll

2013 and Impossible Project have come up

2013 and Impossible Project have come up
with<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.600> new<00:02:46.810> batch<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.200> film<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:48.040> doesn't

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
with a new batch of film that doesn't

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.120 
with a new batch of film that doesn't
need<00:02:48.580> as<00:02:48.850> much<00:02:48.880> shielding<00:02:49.560> they<00:02:50.560> say<00:02:50.740> it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
need as much shielding they say it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.860 
need as much shielding they say it
doesn't<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.520> need<00:02:51.760> any<00:02:51.880> shielding<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.570> in

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
doesn't really need any shielding but in

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.650 
doesn't really need any shielding but in
my<00:02:53.850> experience<00:02:54.850> if<00:02:55.090> you're<00:02:55.270> shooting<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.630> a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
my experience if you're shooting on a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.750 
my experience if you're shooting on a
very<00:02:55.960> bright<00:02:56.290> sunny<00:02:56.770> day<00:02:57.010> like<00:02:57.040> at<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.580> beach

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
very bright sunny day like at the beach

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
very bright sunny day like at the beach
it's<00:02:58.330> still<00:02:58.690> best<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.050> shield<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.620> little

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
it's still best to shield it a little

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.710 
it's still best to shield it a little
bit<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.520> might<00:03:00.700> want<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.970> invest<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.630> a

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
bit so you might want to invest in a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.830 
bit so you might want to invest in a
photo<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.130> photo<00:03:03.730> protecting<00:03:04.330> frog<00:03:04.600> tongue

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
washed out in a bit orange looking this

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.060 
washed out in a bit orange looking this
can<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> way<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.720> help<00:03:10.990> prevent<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
can be a way to help prevent it the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.620 
can be a way to help prevent it the
other<00:03:12.190> benefit<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.670> having<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> firm<00:03:13.240> tongue<00:03:13.480> is

other benefit of having a firm tongue is

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.420 
other benefit of having a firm tongue is
it<00:03:13.720> means<00:03:13.900> if<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.260> do<00:03:14.710> end<00:03:14.950> up<00:03:15.070> with<00:03:15.250> one<00:03:15.400> of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
it means if you do end up with one of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.190 
it means if you do end up with one of
the<00:03:15.580> older<00:03:15.880> batches<00:03:16.240> of<00:03:16.360> film<00:03:16.570> you're<00:03:17.020> not

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
going to be worrying around trying to

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.970 
going to be worrying around trying to
shield<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.900> film<00:03:20.110> as<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.410> comes<00:03:20.590> out<00:03:20.710> quickly

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
shield the film as it comes out quickly

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.110 
shield the film as it comes out quickly
because<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.430> tongue<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:21.730> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.910> be<00:03:22.000> doing
