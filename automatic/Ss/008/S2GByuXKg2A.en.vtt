00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.420
 forward 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.670

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.020
 expectancy 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 today you are seeing here in this room 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.600
 hyundai brand 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.830

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.240
 turbo veloster 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.010
 we have several pec it's a car 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 concept of hb 20 where you can see 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.220
 many things that can be done with 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.110
