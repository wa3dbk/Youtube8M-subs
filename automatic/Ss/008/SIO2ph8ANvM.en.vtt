there were someone who's somewhat

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.370 
there were someone who's somewhat
shorter<00:00:12.120> than<00:00:12.269> six<00:00:12.570> foot<00:00:12.809> I've<00:00:13.049> always

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
shorter than six foot I've always

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.259 
shorter than six foot I've always
believed<00:00:13.770> that<00:00:14.129> good<00:00:14.670> things<00:00:14.940> come<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.180> small

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
believed that good things come in small

believed that good things come in small
packages<00:00:15.800> and<00:00:16.800> these<00:00:17.130> three<00:00:17.369> rods<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.730> we've

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
packages and these three rods that we've

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.089 
packages and these three rods that we've
got<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.420> clearly<00:00:18.900> compact<00:00:19.470> by<00:00:19.680> name<00:00:19.890> on

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
got here a clearly compact by name on

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.310 
got here a clearly compact by name on
compact<00:00:20.550> by<00:00:20.640> nature<00:00:21.090> yeah<00:00:21.540> they<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.900> actually

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
compact by nature yeah they are actually

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.109 
compact by nature yeah they are actually
the<00:00:22.410> compact<00:00:22.830> range<00:00:23.070> includes<00:00:23.580> four<00:00:23.880> rods

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the compact range includes four rods

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.240 
the compact range includes four rods
there's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> ten-foot<00:00:25.080> feeder<00:00:25.349> as<00:00:25.590> well<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.189> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
there's a ten-foot feeder as well and I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
there's a ten-foot feeder as well and I
suppose<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.730> logical<00:00:27.180> place<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> start<00:00:27.660> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
suppose the logical place to start is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
suppose the logical place to start is
with<00:00:28.350> this<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.430> rod<00:00:29.609> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
with this one here which is the rod that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.000 
with this one here which is the rod that
I'm<00:00:29.910> fishing<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.390> today<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
I'm fishing with today now this is the

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.090 
I'm fishing with today now this is the
compact<00:00:32.400> 8-foot<00:00:33.000> feeder<00:00:33.300> rod<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.949> it's<00:00:34.949> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
compact 8-foot feeder rod and it's a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
compact 8-foot feeder rod and it's a
very<00:00:35.340> powerful<00:00:35.699> short<00:00:36.300> feeder<00:00:36.690> rod<00:00:36.989> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
very powerful short feeder rod it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.900 
very powerful short feeder rod it's
brilliant<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:37.980> fisheries<00:00:38.550> where<00:00:38.760> you're

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
brilliant for fisheries where you're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.600 
brilliant for fisheries where you're
after<00:00:39.180> big<00:00:39.390> tench<00:00:39.690> big<00:00:40.589> carp<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.220> anything

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
after big tench big carp and anything

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.970 
after big tench big carp and anything
that's<00:00:41.760> likely<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.210> pull<00:00:42.450> back<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.500> comes<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that's likely to pull back it comes with

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
that's likely to pull back it comes with
a<00:00:44.010> choice<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.790> several<00:00:45.090> quiver<00:00:45.629> tips<00:00:45.899> you've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a choice of several quiver tips you've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260 
a choice of several quiver tips you've
got<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.290> sensitive<00:00:46.710> tip<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.370> three<00:00:47.850> ounce<00:00:48.000> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
got a sensitive tip a three ounce of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
got a sensitive tip a three ounce of
four<00:00:48.480> ounce<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.260> 5<00:00:49.469> ounce<00:00:49.710> tip<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
four ounce and a 5 ounce tip it's a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
four ounce and a 5 ounce tip it's a
beautiful<00:00:51.480> rod<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.200> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.739> tame

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
beautiful rod actually you can tame

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.740 
beautiful rod actually you can tame
really<00:00:53.489> big<00:00:53.700> fish<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.270> rod<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
really big fish on this rod and the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
really big fish on this rod and the
great<00:00:54.989> thing<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.250> short<00:00:56.640> it's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
great thing is because it's short it's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
great thing is because it's short it's
so<00:00:57.719> nice<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.260> fish<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.100> in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

restricted bank space and you're fishing

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
restricted bank space and you're fishing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
kind of work I don't like to use big

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980 
kind of work I don't like to use big
reels<00:01:31.649> for<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> sake<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:32.729> I've<00:01:33.479> chosen

though<00:01:49.709> and<00:01:50.099> I<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.550> absolutely

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
though and I think that's absolutely

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.930 
though and I think that's absolutely
ideal<00:01:51.179> perfect<00:01:52.140> partner<00:01:52.830> for<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:53.520> compact

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
ideal perfect partner for this compact

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.490 
ideal perfect partner for this compact
feeder<00:01:54.270> rod<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.539> think<00:01:54.989> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.289> same

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
feeder rod I think and the same

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.350 
feeder rod I think and the same
principles<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.310> shortness<00:01:56.849> and<00:01:56.970> strength

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
principles of shortness and strength

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.089 
principles of shortness and strength
have<00:01:57.599> been<00:01:57.750> used<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.229> these<00:01:58.440> two<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
have been used with these two the the

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.859 
have been used with these two the the
compact<00:01:59.550> float<00:01:59.849> rod<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:00.300> compact<00:02:00.690> car

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
compact float rod and the compact car

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.930 
compact float rod and the compact car
yeah<00:02:01.259> you've<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.739> a<00:02:01.770> similar<00:02:02.069> principle<00:02:02.369> here

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
yeah you've got a similar principle here

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.850 
yeah you've got a similar principle here
it's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> lovely<00:02:03.479> rod<00:02:03.750> again<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.319> this<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.679> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it's a lovely rod again this this is the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.520 
it's a lovely rod again this this is the
compact<00:02:05.670> float<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.390> 10-foot<00:02:06.959> float<00:02:07.259> rod

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
compact float it's a 10-foot float rod

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.550 
compact float it's a 10-foot float rod
again<00:02:08.399> I've<00:02:08.789> used<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.509> similar<00:02:09.929> reel<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
again I've used a similar reel with it

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.140 
again I've used a similar reel with it
which<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> force<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.430> two-match<00:02:11.790> feeder

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
which is the force a two-match feeder

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.470 
which is the force a two-match feeder
but<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.379> poky<00:02:13.830> rod<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.520> contain<00:02:14.910> big<00:02:15.239> fish

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
but it's a poky rod you contain big fish

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.510 
but it's a poky rod you contain big fish
with<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.780> rod<00:02:15.989> it's<00:02:16.170> perfectly<00:02:17.129> at<00:02:17.250> home

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
with this rod it's perfectly at home

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.200 
with this rod it's perfectly at home
with<00:02:18.210> tent<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.930> carp<00:02:19.710> at<00:02:20.010> close<00:02:20.430> range<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
with tent and carp at close range the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.700 
with tent and carp at close range the
sort<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.540> thing<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.870> do<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.200> you're<00:02:22.350> fishing

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
sort of thing you do if you're fishing

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.390 
sort of thing you do if you're fishing
next<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> these

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
next to these

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
next to these
Tad's<00:02:23.549> yeah<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.239> not<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> reward<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.780> use<00:02:24.930> for

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
Tad's yeah it's not a reward to use for

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.899 
Tad's yeah it's not a reward to use for
long<00:02:25.260> range<00:02:25.500> waggle<00:02:25.950> officiate<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.730> need<00:02:26.879> a

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
long range waggle officiate you need a

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.759 
long range waggle officiate you need a
longer<00:02:27.150> rod<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.379> short-range

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
longer rod for that but for short-range

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.710 
longer rod for that but for short-range
under<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.579> rod<00:02:29.970> stuff<00:02:30.269> where<00:02:30.480> you've<00:02:30.569> got<00:02:30.689> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
under the rod stuff where you've got a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.479 
under the rod stuff where you've got a
hit<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.079> hold<00:02:31.230> them<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.560> bit<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.459> a

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
hit and hold them a bit this is a

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.789 
hit and hold them a bit this is a
fantastic<00:02:33.450> piece<00:02:33.689> of<00:02:33.720> kit<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.620> quite

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
fantastic piece of kit and it's quite

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.039 
fantastic piece of kit and it's quite
unusual<00:02:34.980> these<00:02:35.459> days<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:36.000> find<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.420> ten-foot

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
unusual these days to find a ten-foot

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.080 
unusual these days to find a ten-foot
float<00:02:37.319> rod<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.459> really<00:02:38.909> good

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
float rod so I think it's a really good

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.569 
float rod so I think it's a really good
addition<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> compact<00:02:40.109> range<00:02:40.409> and<00:02:41.400> this

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
addition to the compact range and this

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.599 
addition to the compact range and this
one<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.120> carb<00:02:42.359> rod<00:02:42.599> well<00:02:43.439> well<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.129> think<00:02:44.280> this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
one the carb rod well well I think this

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.729 
one the carb rod well well I think this
is<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.819> really<00:02:45.150> interesting<00:02:45.390> rod<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.049> mean<00:02:46.379> why

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
is a really interesting rod I mean why

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.949 
is a really interesting rod I mean why
do<00:02:46.799> we<00:02:47.099> use<00:02:47.129> 12<00:02:47.640> foot<00:02:47.819> carp<00:02:48.090> rods<00:02:48.329> on<00:02:48.510> small<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
do we use 12 foot carp rods on small to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.020 
do we use 12 foot carp rods on small to
medium<00:02:49.290> sized<00:02:49.500> carp<00:02:49.859> waters<00:02:50.310> I've<00:02:50.489> never

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
medium sized carp waters I've never

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
medium sized carp waters I've never
really<00:02:51.420> understood<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.079> if<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.829> fish<00:02:53.189> with

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
really understood it if you fish with

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.460 
really understood it if you fish with
the<00:02:53.489> rod<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.879> this<00:02:53.909> it'll<00:02:54.540> cast<00:02:54.900> as<00:02:55.140> far<00:02:55.349> as

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
the rod like this it'll cast as far as

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.470 
the rod like this it'll cast as far as
you<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.040> except<00:02:56.639> on<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.909> really<00:02:57.209> big

and<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.500> know<00:03:25.650> summing<00:03:26.040> up<00:03:26.159> on<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
and I think you know summing up on the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.819 
and I think you know summing up on the
compact<00:03:26.819> range<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.359> think<00:03:27.389> for<00:03:28.290> small<00:03:28.410> to

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
compact range I think for small to

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.189 
compact range I think for small to
medium<00:03:29.220> sized<00:03:29.489> waters<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.299> don't<00:03:30.629> need<00:03:30.870> great

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
medium sized waters you don't need great

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.140 
medium sized waters you don't need great
big<00:03:31.379> long<00:03:31.560> rods<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.489> give<00:03:32.699> these<00:03:32.849> rods

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
big long rods and if you give these rods

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
big long rods and if you give these rods
a<00:03:33.299> try<00:03:33.569> you'll<00:03:34.290> discover<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.829> new<00:03:35.010> joy<00:03:35.250> in

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
a try you'll discover a new joy in

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.069 
a try you'll discover a new joy in
fishing<00:03:35.760> they're<00:03:35.940> fantastic<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> fish<00:03:36.900> with

their little pocket battleships yes
now<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.540> mentioned<00:03:39.989> if<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.230> were<00:03:40.349> float

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
now you mentioned if you were float

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.039 
now you mentioned if you were float
fishing<00:03:40.859> at<00:03:41.129> longer<00:03:41.370> range<00:03:41.760> or<00:03:42.120> looking<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
fishing at longer range or looking to

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.199 
fishing at longer range or looking to
strike<00:03:43.349> bites<00:03:43.680> maybe<00:03:43.980> on<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.579> drop<00:03:44.819> at<00:03:45.030> long

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.360 
strike bites maybe on the drop at long
long<00:03:45.659> hooks<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.079> needed<00:03:46.409> a<00:03:46.500> longer<00:03:46.739> float<00:03:47.129> rod

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
long hooks you needed a longer float rod

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.800 
long hooks you needed a longer float rod
and<00:03:47.790> I'll<00:03:47.879> take<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> that's<00:03:48.329> where<00:03:48.510> something

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and I'll take it that's where something

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.689 
and I'll take it that's where something
like<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.079> will<00:03:49.290> come<00:03:49.409> in<00:03:49.560> yeah<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.340> mean<00:03:50.489> this

is<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.879> more<00:03:51.239> traditional<00:03:51.530> float<00:03:52.530> rod<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:52.979> call

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
is a more traditional float rod we call

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.039 
is a more traditional float rod we call
this<00:03:53.370> one<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.609> classic<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.389> 13<00:03:54.810> foot

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
this one the classic it's a 13 foot

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.050 
this one the classic it's a 13 foot
float<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.739> can<00:03:55.859> see<00:03:56.069> it's<00:03:56.280> got<00:03:56.489> very

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
float and you can see it's got very

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180 
float and you can see it's got very
classic<00:03:57.569> looks<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.650> look<00:03:58.799> at<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:58.979> color

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
fast crisp rod and this is the sort of

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.379 
fast crisp rod and this is the sort of
thing<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.800> whereas<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.639> will<00:04:26.729> cope<00:04:27.060> with<00:04:27.300> the

odd marauding big tential carp it's

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.779 
odd marauding big tential carp it's
perfectly<00:04:30.630> at<00:04:30.810> home<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.710> all-round<00:04:32.400> float

fishing where you've got to fish further
out<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.889> hit<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.430> bites<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.060> think<00:04:36.270> it's<00:04:36.419> a

out and hit the bites and I think it's a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.159 
out and hit the bites and I think it's a
beautifully

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
beautifully

among us and people who are looking for
an<00:04:43.919> all-round<00:04:44.400> rod<00:04:44.669> that<00:04:44.879> will<00:04:44.969> do<00:04:45.120> just<00:04:45.150> about

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
an all-round rod that will do just about

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.230 
an all-round rod that will do just about
everything<00:04:45.990> then<00:04:46.469> quite<00:04:47.159> frankly<00:04:47.189> I'd<00:04:47.909> look

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
everything then quite frankly I'd look

no<00:04:48.389> further<00:04:48.599> than<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.990> classic<00:04:49.379> float<00:04:49.590> I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
no further than the classic float I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.759 
no further than the classic float I
think<00:04:49.979> it's<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.159> belt<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.550> rod
