00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 this video shows how to use the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.940
 notion of family of elements for them 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 poles and soles the purpose of this 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 grouping of items by family is 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.550
 to homogenize the results concerning 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 these elements all the elements of a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.980
 same family will have the same material the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.690
 same dimensions and the same reinforcement 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.539
 the family creation command is 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.510
 accessible through the family hypothesis menu 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.970
 of elements a family of elements is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 here already created 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.019
 we will create a second one in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 clicking add a family 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.350
 of elements is defined by the name of its 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.030
 family for example dimension 25 a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 title for example 25-dimensional post 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 from the first floor then choose the type 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 of family items a family does not 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.360
 can not match several types 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.760
 of different elements it is for example 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.410
 impossible to group a pole and a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.410
 sole within the same family 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.580
 then choose the tasks involved because 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.729
 the grouping of the elements is done by 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 floor choose common properties 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 dimension materials and choose the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.759
 export options to the modules of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.350
 reinforcement then click ok the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.180
 family to which belongs an element 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.180
 is specified in his status card 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.490
 assign a family to each of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.490
 poles 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.399
 then launching the calculation 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.850
 the document description of the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 families allows to visualize for 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 each of the item families the list 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.980
 elements the component as well as 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.450
 the preponderant element ie 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.660
 whoever has the efforts street to him the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.230
 more important by default in this 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.490
 example if I export pole number 4 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.410
 to the post module the plan 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.380
 execution will correspond to that obtained 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.610
 by the number 2 post which is the element 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.610
 preponderant of this family 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.020
 we get results for the pole 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.060
 number 2 concrete 0 19 cubic meters steel 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:53.160
 13 9 kg it is possible in the options 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.670
 check plans total nomenclature 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.959
 for all elements the results 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.910
 then display for all three 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.910
 elements of the same family
