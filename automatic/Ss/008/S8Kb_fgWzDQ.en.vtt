00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
oh well oh and here's I also had an

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.710 
oh well oh and here's I also had an

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
another idea if you had a big stack of

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.590 
another idea if you had a big stack of
these<00:02:05.929> what's<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.740> middle<00:02:06.920> cut<00:02:07.100> out<00:02:07.220> cut<00:02:07.399> out

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
these what's the middle cut out cut out

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.419 
these what's the middle cut out cut out
like<00:02:08.600> imagine<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.500> stack<00:02:09.709> was<00:02:09.920> about<00:02:10.160> a

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
like imagine your stack was about a

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.800 
like imagine your stack was about a
couple<00:02:10.580> inches<00:02:10.850> high<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.670> um<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:14.480> had<00:02:14.660> them

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
couple inches high and um you had them

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.030 
couple inches high and um you had them
all<00:02:14.930> cut<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.200> like<00:02:15.319> this<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.680> could<00:02:15.890> put

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
all cut out like this you could put

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.320 
all cut out like this you could put
stuff<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:16.400> here<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.640> could<00:02:16.760> like<00:02:16.880> hide<00:02:17.060> stuff

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
stuff in here you could like hide stuff

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.900 
stuff in here you could like hide stuff
in<00:02:17.480> there<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:19.569> put<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.630> card<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:20.959> top<00:02:21.910> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
in there and then put a card on top you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.699 
in there and then put a card on top you
could<00:02:23.000> hide<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.360> money<00:02:23.660> or<00:02:24.579> something

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
could hide like money or something

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.020 
could hide like money or something
inside<00:02:27.709> stack<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.160> pokemon<00:02:28.459> cards<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.880> if<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
inside stack of pokemon cards and if you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.240 
inside stack of pokemon cards and if you
have<00:02:29.180> people<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.810> through<00:02:30.110> your<00:02:30.860> room<00:02:31.040> and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
looking for stuff they probably wouldn't

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.560 
looking for stuff they probably wouldn't
look<00:02:32.570> inside<00:02:32.989> your<00:02:33.140> pokemon<00:02:33.500> cards<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:35.150> that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
look inside your pokemon cards so that

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.750 
look inside your pokemon cards so that
could<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.959> hiding<00:02:36.739> container

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
could be like a hiding container

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.980 
could be like a hiding container
Oh<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:39.260> scan<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.590> my<00:02:39.709> video
