00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.170
 the last week and a half was one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.070
 warm with much satisfaction 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.930
 looked at 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.519
 first of all by niklas moisander die 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.560
 became a proud father 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.640
 and through very hawks to the placement 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.090
 for the next round of the europe 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.160
 league 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.689
 and the beautiful a 3 victory in the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.300
 topper against psv 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 therefore choose and there it is yes he sits 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.060
 go on to good even though 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 match or not good win 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.019
 PSV and that we do is certain 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 extend yes very difference with 2 week 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.900
 ago 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.980
 yes so then the one for one I had 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.300
 give one to the interview 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
 honey you just felt a bit there 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.870
 everyone who has a little more laughter 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 always if you win if you lose 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.629
 then you do not go too often joke 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.879
 so that the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.620
 then you actually don't want it either 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.289
 feels good and occurs earlier too 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.649
 as if something wrong had already left one 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.670
 nice quiet week was your purpose 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 yes of course a bit busy 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 played many matches during this period 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.890
 many journeys such as the two laid out 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.030
 days you certainly feel reborn now 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.740
 yes I don't want to call it that but you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.479
 do you feel for that i want a soda 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.520
 come again for a few weeks 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 matches every three four days so me 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.270
 I think it was good 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 for a moment 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 ducks two days past also about it 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
 slow the gap with leader PSV still 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.369
 11 points for ajax remain the interests 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.440
 big 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.880
 we still have the second place 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.580
 safe 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.619
 secure and of course everyone 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.450
 has a role for whether it is still possible 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.250
 as long as the man i am it is a reason 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.709
 that can do everything is possible two 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.289
 lima fund is more about me getting it 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.640
 yes continue to build from warmly engaged 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.190
 are and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.140
 and only think of ourselves and next 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.630
 match that is excelsior sunday 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
 similarly in the person of bass coopers one 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.800
 good mercenary 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.630
 you know basses a bit personally 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.119
 a good guy and a good soccer player 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.330
 of course also in nice shape that you 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.580
 sees that he has the permanent place there I 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.560
 now I am there and there I am 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.050
 happy for him but the but without 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.569
 does not care who first that was difficult 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.670
 and yes you know they just 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.019
 they will always make you difficult and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.030
 then it must be very well armed 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.209
 good for take or other minutes 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.020
 disturb it and it does something completely 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.380
 by 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.760
 has from the farmer when 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.760
 happy handful change 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.810
 very annoying boy very much tile 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.490
 and another idea that this lay no dude 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 Frank the farmer has to go against Excelsior with 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.950
 start a different striker than against psv 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.510
 because of the injury of her family 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.050
 no it will be the new one maybe 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.460
 by davy klaassen can start and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.050
 about who e-mails during peak hours 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.300
 Frank the farmer is very clear who they are 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.340
 Sunday's sleep was also this week 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.010
 clear that even after the summer franc 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.240
 farmer the trainer of ajax i'm broken 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.410
 clarity to the group by thinking 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.000
 that would also be the case for the trainer 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.430
 it is good that everyone knows to by 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.960
 are your debt a lot of turmoil 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.460
 no have the think yes also know for sure 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.230
 He has a clear vision of how he is 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.260
 how he wants to play football and I think so 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.290
 everyone around the club and and inside 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.960
 the club agree and beyond 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.660
 so I think good good 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.850
 good mixers and just like frank the farmer 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.360
 will stay on lasse schÃ¶ne for the time being 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.190
 Ajax 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.960
 I also want lascaux in which position 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.580
 after which use and very important 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.780
 of course being 11 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.310
 that he is beige again 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.700
 in terms of danes, it is also the case at ajax 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.400
 sitting well for years to come was certainly 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.870
 want and really have the feeling of 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.100
 we are a growth which it was 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.620
 again a little can be addressed 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.260
 and that must go away 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.420
 good we against legia and psv ajax 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.840
 coming to Europe in the coming weeks 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.970
 league 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.750
 and to start Sunday in the arena and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.750
 excelsior
