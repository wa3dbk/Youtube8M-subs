landing a charm there but i i i think it

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.689 
landing a charm there but i i i think it
was<00:01:01.480> more<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.870> team<00:01:02.440> sort<00:01:03.219> of<00:01:03.309> failing<00:01:03.579> their

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
was more a a team sort of failing their

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.189 
was more a a team sort of failing their
biology<00:01:04.180> i<00:01:04.210> think<00:01:04.390> they<00:01:04.449> had<00:01:04.629> game<00:01:04.869> two<00:01:05.050> in<00:01:05.140> the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
biology i think they had game two in the

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.900 
biology i think they had game two in the
bag<00:01:05.379> their<00:01:05.590> initial<00:01:05.890> strategy<00:01:06.039> where<00:01:06.789> those

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
bag their initial strategy where those

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.580 
bag their initial strategy where those
early<00:01:07.149> pushes<00:01:07.479> was<00:01:07.630> really<00:01:07.930> really<00:01:08.110> smart<00:01:08.410> and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
early pushes was really really smart and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.870 
early pushes was really really smart and
they<00:01:08.710> could<00:01:08.920> have<00:01:09.009> kept<00:01:09.190> pushing<00:01:09.490> that<00:01:09.580> bottom

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
they could have kept pushing that bottom

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
they could have kept pushing that bottom
turret<00:01:10.090> up<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.840> inhibitor<00:01:11.229> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
turret up to the inhibitor and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.499 
turret up to the inhibitor and
capitalizing<00:01:12.340> there<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.270> know<00:01:13.360> again

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
capitalizing there but you know again

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:14.969 
capitalizing there but you know again
i'm<00:01:13.690> not<00:01:13.899> quite<00:01:14.140> sure<00:01:14.170> why<00:01:14.470> they<00:01:14.649> why<00:01:14.860> they

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
i'm not quite sure why they why they

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.300 
i'm not quite sure why they why they

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
out is what I really one of the first

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.529 
out is what I really one of the first
times<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.099> ever<00:01:51.250> seen<00:01:51.429> a<00:01:51.459> team<00:01:52.060> just<00:01:52.300> ban

jungle is in a row yeah and normally

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.729 
jungle is in a row yeah and normally
don't<00:01:55.300> see<00:01:55.539> first<00:01:56.080> pic<00:01:56.229> knock<00:01:56.410> trim<00:01:56.619> that<00:01:56.679> off

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
don't see first pic knock trim that off

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.100 
don't see first pic knock trim that off
and<00:01:57.130> most<00:01:57.610> teams<00:01:57.819> don't<00:01:57.940> run<00:01:58.060> under<00:01:58.300> very<00:01:58.929> much

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
and most teams don't run under very much

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.050 
and most teams don't run under very much
nor<00:01:59.920> would<00:01:59.979> be<00:02:00.069> most<00:02:00.220> teams<00:02:00.429> run<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.759> stray<00:02:00.970> off

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
nor would be most teams run a stray off

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.910 
nor would be most teams run a stray off
and<00:02:01.090> especially<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.690> North<00:02:01.840> America<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.440> so

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
and especially in North America and so

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.320 
and especially in North America and so
there<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.340> don't<00:02:03.459> think<00:02:03.700> they're<00:02:03.789> just<00:02:03.819> used<00:02:04.149> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
there I don't think they're just used to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.940 
there I don't think they're just used to
like<00:02:04.479> hey<00:02:04.720> hotshot<00:02:05.050> split<00:02:05.380> pushers<00:02:05.649> gonna<00:02:05.800> get

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
like hey hotshot split pushers gonna get

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.949 
like hey hotshot split pushers gonna get
caught<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.489> and<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.270> think<00:02:07.569> that<00:02:07.690> was<00:02:07.840> kind

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
caught and and so I think that was kind

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.510 
caught and and so I think that was kind
of<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.140> feeling<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.440> them<00:02:08.590> not<00:02:08.770> quite<00:02:09.129> being<00:02:09.369> as

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
of a feeling of them not quite being as

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.070 
of a feeling of them not quite being as
prepared<00:02:09.819> as<00:02:09.879> they<00:02:09.940> could<00:02:10.179> be<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.599> we're

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080

you<00:03:10.519> guys<00:03:10.670> played<00:03:11.030> an<00:03:11.239> incredible<00:03:11.870> first<00:03:12.049> game

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
you guys played an incredible first game

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.949 
you guys played an incredible first game
he<00:03:12.500> came<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:12.799> very<00:03:13.069> strong<00:03:13.610> how<00:03:14.239> much<00:03:14.629> did<00:03:14.870> you

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
he came out very strong how much did you

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.539 
he came out very strong how much did you
guys<00:03:15.079> use<00:03:15.379> that<00:03:15.590> momentum<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:16.160> come<00:03:16.310> into<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
guys use that momentum to come into the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.629 
guys use that momentum to come into the
second<00:03:16.879> game<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.500> second<00:03:18.980> game<00:03:19.160> was<00:03:19.400> like

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
second game the the second game was like

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.199 
second game the the second game was like
the<00:03:19.790> most<00:03:19.970> hot<00:03:20.299> game<00:03:21.040> in<00:03:22.040> two<00:03:22.519> months<00:03:22.700> for<00:03:23.030> me<00:03:23.180> I

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
the most hot game in two months for me I

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.900 
the most hot game in two months for me I
think<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:24.019> was<00:03:24.290> really<00:03:24.590> nervous<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:25.489> was<00:03:25.670> just

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
think it was really nervous it was just

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.960 
think it was really nervous it was just
one<00:03:26.840> mistake<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.639> it<00:03:28.639> cost<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:29.030> lot<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:30.700> we<00:03:31.700> knew

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
one mistake and it cost a lot so we knew

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.210 
one mistake and it cost a lot so we knew
we<00:03:32.209> just<00:03:32.480> felt<00:03:33.109> that<00:03:33.260> they<00:03:33.650> will<00:03:33.799> solve<00:03:34.069> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
we just felt that they will solve the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.660 
we just felt that they will solve the
lanes<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:36.019> predicted<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.160> then<00:03:37.340> they

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
lanes so we predicted that but then they

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.610 
lanes so we predicted that but then they
swapped<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.060> again<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:38.599> they<00:03:38.959> got<00:03:39.109> teleport

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
swapped that again and they got teleport

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.199 
swapped that again and they got teleport
they<00:03:40.040> got<00:03:40.220> new<00:03:40.370> numbers<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.910> they<00:03:40.940> got

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
they got new numbers so they got

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.449 
they got new numbers so they got
advantage<00:03:41.630> in<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.769> gave<00:03:43.010> them<00:03:43.190> huge

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
advantage in that that gave them huge

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.220 
advantage in that that gave them huge
advantage<00:03:43.910> with<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.359> two<00:03:44.569> or<00:03:44.750> three<00:03:44.780> towers

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
advantage with like two or three towers

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.430 
advantage with like two or three towers
and<00:03:45.709> then<00:03:46.609> they<00:03:47.239> were<00:03:47.299> just<00:03:47.599> snowballing<00:03:48.169> that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and then they were just snowballing that

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.879 
and then they were just snowballing that
advantage<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:49.160> lot<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.030> then<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.750> hotshot<00:03:51.680> got

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
advantage a lot and then a hotshot got

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.159 
advantage a lot and then a hotshot got
teleport<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:52.760> they<00:03:53.329> were<00:03:53.389> just<00:03:53.690> pushing<00:03:53.930> us

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
teleport so they were just pushing us

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.650 
teleport so they were just pushing us
all<00:03:54.349> around<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.940> one<00:03:56.180> day<00:03:56.299> our<00:03:56.359> choice

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
all around and the one day our choice

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.960 
all around and the one day our choice
was<00:03:56.870> like<00:03:57.049> we're<00:03:57.319> going<00:03:57.620> mid<00:03:58.190> late<00:03:58.400> game<00:03:58.669> and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
was like we're going mid late game and

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.229 
was like we're going mid late game and
kitchen<00:03:59.510> on<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.959> mistakes<00:04:00.500> with<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.829> arrow

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
kitchen on the mistakes with the arrow

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.640 
kitchen on the mistakes with the arrow
that's<00:04:02.239> what<00:04:02.419> we<00:04:02.569> did<00:04:02.720> when<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:02.989> caught<00:04:03.440> and

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650
