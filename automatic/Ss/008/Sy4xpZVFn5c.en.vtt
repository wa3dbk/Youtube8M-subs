00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
double-sided so on the reverse side you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.470

you how the pieces move but first let me
point<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.789> how<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> game<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> set<00:00:45.930> up

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
point out this is how the game is set up

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
point out this is how the game is set up
the<00:00:47.190> playing<00:00:47.460> pieces<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:48.030> put<00:00:48.950> placed<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the playing pieces are put placed on the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.639 
the playing pieces are put placed on the
intersections<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> lines<00:00:51.600> right<00:00:52.289> here

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
intersections of the lines right here

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.029 
intersections of the lines right here
yeah<00:00:52.920> they're<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.309> played<00:00:54.260> within<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> box

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
yeah they're not played within the box

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.750 
yeah they're not played within the box
but<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.510> intersection<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> lines

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
but here the intersection of the lines

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.540 
but here the intersection of the lines
and<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.059> game<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> basically<00:01:01.309> similar<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and the game is basically similar to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.950 
and the game is basically similar to
chess<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.300> there's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> king<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.960> object

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
chess in that there's a king and object

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
chess in that there's a king and object
of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> game<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.619> capture<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.280> opponent's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of the game is to capture the opponent's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.789 
of the game is to capture the opponent's
king<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.439> these<00:01:10.590> different

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
king and you have all these different

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
king and you have all these different
pieces<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.700> move<00:01:12.110> differently<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> have

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
pieces that move differently and have

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
pieces that move differently and have
different<00:01:15.020> abilities<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:17.159> capture<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
different abilities to capture and to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
different abilities to capture and to
defend<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.810> I'll<00:01:18.930> show<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.170> how<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> pieces

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
defend so I'll show you how the pieces

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
defend so I'll show you how the pieces
move<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> minute<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> two

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
move in just a minute and here the two

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.800 
move in just a minute and here the two
sides<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:25.020> divided<00:01:25.409> by<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.530> river<00:01:25.890> here

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
sides are divided by the river here

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.980 
sides are divided by the river here
elephants<00:01:27.810> cannot<00:01:28.110> cross<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> river<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
elephants cannot cross the river and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.359 
elephants cannot cross the river and
here<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.960> fortress<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.619> king<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
here you have the fortress the king and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390 
here you have the fortress the king and
the<00:01:36.000> guards<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.869> limited<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.530> movement<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the guards are limited in movement to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
the guards are limited in movement to
the<00:01:38.549> fortress<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.810> that's<00:01:39.990> basically<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the fortress so that's basically the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.550 
the fortress so that's basically the
setup<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> board<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> pieces<00:01:45.560> let's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
setup of the board and the pieces let's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.230 
setup of the board and the pieces let's
look<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> relative<00:01:47.280> value<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> pieces

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
look at the relative value of the pieces

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600 
look at the relative value of the pieces
the<00:01:48.810> most<00:01:49.020> powerful<00:01:49.530> pieces<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.040> rook<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the most powerful pieces the rook the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.010 
the most powerful pieces the rook the
rook<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.450> given<00:01:51.869> an<00:01:52.110> arbitrary<00:01:52.680> value<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> 10

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
rook is given an arbitrary value of 10

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.289 
rook is given an arbitrary value of 10
the<00:01:55.020> knight<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> value<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.430> 4<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the knight has a value of about 4 to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
the knight has a value of about 4 to
begin<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> game<00:01:58.049> between<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> end<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
begin in the game between the end of the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.020 
begin in the game between the end of the
game<00:01:59.130> its<00:01:59.340> value<00:01:59.729> increases<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.780> 5<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
game its value increases to about 5 and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.190 
game its value increases to about 5 and
the<00:02:03.390> cannon<00:02:03.869> begins<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> value<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.070> 5<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
the cannon begins with a value of 5 and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.300 
the cannon begins with a value of 5 and
maintains<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.439> pretty<00:02:07.680> much<00:02:07.829> throughout<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
maintains it pretty much throughout the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.380 
maintains it pretty much throughout the
game<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.929> guard<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> elephant<00:02:11.390> begin

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
game the guard and the elephant begin

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.490 
game the guard and the elephant begin
the<00:02:12.510> game<00:02:12.720> with

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the game with

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.730 
the game with
of<00:02:13.770> two<00:02:14.010> points<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.380> toward<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> end<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.650> the
