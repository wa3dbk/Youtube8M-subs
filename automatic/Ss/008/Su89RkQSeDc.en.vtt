they<00:02:13.430> end<00:02:13.550> up<00:02:13.670> turning<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.420> how<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.840> can

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
they end up turning to and how that can

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.370 
they end up turning to and how that can
be<00:02:15.110> manipulated<00:02:16.450> ultimately<00:02:17.450> Sophia<00:02:17.959> lamb<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
be manipulated ultimately Sophia lamb is

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.710 
be manipulated ultimately Sophia lamb is
an<00:02:18.500> altruist<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.310> her<00:02:19.790> philosophy<00:02:20.120> when<00:02:20.630> it

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
an altruist and her philosophy when it

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
one of which is the rumbler now

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.800 
one of which is the rumbler now
sharp-eyed<00:02:37.489> viewers<00:02:37.549> will<00:02:38.120> notice<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.630> the

sharp-eyed viewers will notice that the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 
sharp-eyed viewers will notice that the
rumbler<00:02:39.200> actually<00:02:39.739> is<00:02:40.190> one<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.640> original

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
rumbler actually is one of the original

Big<00:02:41.630> Daddy<00:02:41.870> looks<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.680> never<00:02:42.860> made<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.070> into

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
Big Daddy looks that never made it into

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.979 
Big Daddy looks that never made it into
the<00:02:43.459> first<00:02:43.640> game<00:02:43.850> we've<00:02:44.450> overhauled<00:02:44.750> his

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
the first game we've overhauled his

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.960 
the first game we've overhauled his
behaviors<00:02:45.500> completely<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.160> basically<00:02:46.790> made

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
behaviors completely and basically made

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.910 
behaviors completely and basically made
him<00:02:47.209> from<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> ground<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.380> in<00:02:48.530> terms<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.829> his

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
him from the ground up in terms of his

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.039 
him from the ground up in terms of his
functionality<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.209> art<00:02:50.480> direction<00:02:50.959> we

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
functionality but that art direction we

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.990 
functionality but that art direction we
wanted<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.320> make<00:02:51.470> sure<00:02:51.500> sort<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.310> inherited

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
wanted to make sure sort of inherited

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.140 
wanted to make sure sort of inherited
from<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.269> same<00:02:53.480> spread<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.519> player

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
from the same spread that that player

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.759 
from the same spread that that player
faced<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.600> first<00:02:56.810> game<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.350> took<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
faced in the first game so we took the

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.220 
faced in the first game so we took the
rumbler<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.400> brought<00:02:58.730> him<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.150> fore<00:02:59.390> he

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
rumbler and brought him to the fore he

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.830

player but I thought there was something
very<00:04:51.210> primal<00:04:51.690> about<00:04:52.230> these<00:04:52.440> two<00:04:52.620> characters

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
very primal about these two characters

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.270 
very primal about these two characters
and<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.870> we<00:04:54.870> could<00:04:55.080> spin<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.070> very

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
and that we could spin that in a very

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.129 
and that we could spin that in a very
broad<00:04:56.580> way<00:04:56.960> into<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.260> sort<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.919> thematic

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.480 
through to the end so that character has
sort<00:07:01.360> of<00:07:01.500> fractal<00:07:02.500> doubt<00:07:02.710> into<00:07:03.070> their<00:07:03.250> into

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
sort of fractal doubt into their into

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.640 
sort of fractal doubt into their into
different<00:07:03.700> incarnations<00:07:04.330> and<00:07:04.570> you<00:07:05.320> guys<00:07:05.440> will

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
different incarnations and you guys will

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.560 
different incarnations and you guys will
will<00:07:06.040> I<00:07:06.220> guess<00:07:06.520> experience<00:07:07.030> those<00:07:07.180> first<00:07:07.390> and

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
will I guess experience those first and

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.190 
will I guess experience those first and
so<00:07:08.140> Bioshock<00:07:08.890> 2<00:07:09.070> is<00:07:09.280> coming<00:07:09.490> out<00:07:09.700> for<00:07:10.030> Xbox<00:07:10.960> 360
