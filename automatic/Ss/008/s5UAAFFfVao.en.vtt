hi I'm Chris berry and I'm presenter of

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.230 
hi I'm Chris berry and I'm presenter of
Britain's<00:00:03.540> greatest<00:00:03.780> machines<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.910> as<00:00:05.910> you

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
Britain's greatest machines and as you

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.460 
Britain's greatest machines and as you
can<00:00:06.420> probably<00:00:06.450> see<00:00:06.810> at<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.080> moment<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.440> am

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
can probably see at the moment I am

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.820 
can probably see at the moment I am
sitting<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.570> one-third<00:00:09.570> scale<00:00:10.019> replica<00:00:10.650> of

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
sitting on a one-third scale replica of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.919 
sitting on a one-third scale replica of
the<00:00:11.219> Hornsby<00:00:11.849> chain<00:00:12.509> tracked<00:00:12.870> tractor<00:00:13.429> which

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
the Hornsby chain tracked tractor which

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.880 
the Hornsby chain tracked tractor which
judging<00:00:15.929> by<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> fact<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.710> one

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
judging by the fact that this is one

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010 
judging by the fact that this is one
third<00:00:17.160> scale<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.150> quite<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> beast<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.930> its

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
third scale it was quite a beast in its

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529 
third scale it was quite a beast in its
day<00:00:19.490> but<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.699> only<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> many

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
day but this is only one of many

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
day but this is only one of many
machines<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.470> covering<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:23.609> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
machines that we are covering in this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.810 
machines that we are covering in this
fantastic<00:00:24.600> program<00:00:25.580> it's<00:00:26.580> certainly

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
fantastic program it's certainly

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.929 
fantastic program it's certainly
fantastic<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.539> present<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.949> I'm<00:00:29.070> sure<00:00:29.279> it'll

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
fantastic to present and I'm sure it'll

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.319 
fantastic to present and I'm sure it'll
be<00:00:30.060> fantastic<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.539> watch<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.869> well<00:00:36.950> well<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
be fantastic to watch as well well to be

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.380 
be fantastic to watch as well well to be
honest<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.280> continuation<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.850> really

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
honest it's it's continuation of really

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.420 
honest it's it's continuation of really
it's<00:00:42.570> there's<00:00:43.079> no<00:00:43.460> big<00:00:44.460> difference<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's there's no big difference is that I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's there's no big difference is that I
am<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.059> now<00:00:49.370> but<00:00:50.370> no<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
am going to go into now but no to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
am going to go into now but no to
actually<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> day-to-day<00:00:52.320> filming

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
actually you know the day-to-day filming

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
actually you know the day-to-day filming
process<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> same<00:00:54.660> we're<00:00:55.079> just

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
process is much the same we're just

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.200 
process is much the same we're just
doing<00:00:55.559> three<00:00:55.890> obviously<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.430> doing<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
doing three obviously we're doing the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.660 
doing three obviously we're doing the
differences<00:00:57.719> we're<00:00:57.930> doing<00:00:58.079> four<00:00:58.289> different

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
differences we're doing four different

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.720 
differences we're doing four different
stories<00:00:59.670> within<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> 1910s<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.160> 1920s<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
stories within the 1910s the 1920s the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.270 
stories within the 1910s the 1920s the
1940s<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.309> what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.640> call<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> suppose<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
1940s and what I can call I suppose a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.530 
1940s and what I can call I suppose a
railway<00:01:08.280> special<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
railway special if you like which is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
railway special if you like which is
completely<00:01:09.869> different<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.350> many<00:01:10.439> ways<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
completely different in many ways to the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.320 
completely different in many ways to the
other<00:01:11.070> which<00:01:11.310> goes<00:01:11.520> right<00:01:11.549> back<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
other which goes right back to the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.680 
other which goes right back to the
beginning<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.860> railways<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.250> country

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.720 

well<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.080> train<00:01:24.380> was<00:01:24.590> was<00:01:25.070> right<00:01:25.340> at<00:01:25.580> the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
well the train was was right at the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.830 
well the train was was right at the
beginning<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.330> Industrial<00:01:26.810> Revolution

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
beginning of the Industrial Revolution

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.530 
beginning of the Industrial Revolution
it<00:01:27.470> was<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:27.950> was<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:29.270> transformed

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
it was it was it just transformed

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.470 
it was it was it just transformed
everything<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.710> helped<00:01:31.400> our<00:01:31.760> industry<00:01:32.300> and

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
everything and helped our industry and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.660 
everything and helped our industry and
that<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.990> early<00:01:33.290> part<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.980> 19th<00:01:34.580> century

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
that that early part of the 19th century

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.200 
that that early part of the 19th century
it<00:01:35.650> it<00:01:36.650> made<00:01:36.920> Britain<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.370> world<00:01:37.580> winner<00:01:37.940> you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
it it made Britain the world winner you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.170 
it it made Britain the world winner you
know<00:01:38.360> alongside<00:01:38.690> ships<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:41.030> know

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
know alongside ships and you know

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.990 
know alongside ships and you know
ultimately<00:01:41.810> all<00:01:42.590> sorts<00:01:43.220> of<00:01:43.280> machinery<00:01:43.700> but

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
ultimately all sorts of machinery but

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000 
ultimately all sorts of machinery but
you<00:01:44.300> know<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.810> was<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> great<00:01:45.620> help<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:45.950> my

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
you know it was a great help to my

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:54.100 
you know it was a great help to my
mining<00:01:46.400> industry<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:46.940> everything<00:01:52.870> yeah<00:01:53.870> we

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
mining industry and everything yeah we

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.660 
mining industry and everything yeah we
had<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.350> wheel<00:01:54.830> drive<00:01:55.520> shaft<00:01:55.930> snap<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.740> shear<00:01:58.430> on

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
had a wheel drive shaft snap a shear on

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.320 
had a wheel drive shaft snap a shear on
a<00:01:59.230> Daimler<00:02:00.230> scout<00:02:01.010> car<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.490> other<00:02:01.580> day<00:02:01.670> but<00:02:02.270> I

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
a Daimler scout car the other day but I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.690 
a Daimler scout car the other day but I
wasn't<00:02:02.660> in<00:02:02.900> it<00:02:02.930> at<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.140> time<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.620> just<00:02:04.430> saw<00:02:04.580> it

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
wasn't in it at the time I just saw it

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330 
wasn't in it at the time I just saw it
go<00:02:04.850> ping<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.630> thought<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.960> was<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.340> British

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
go ping and I thought it was a British

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.830 
go ping and I thought it was a British
Tommies<00:02:07.550> helmet<00:02:08.119> which<00:02:08.300> has<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.570> flown<00:02:08.780> out

Tommies helmet which has just flown out
in<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.170> back<00:02:09.380> but<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.800> wasn't<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.280> was

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
in the back but it wasn't it was

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.880 
in the back but it wasn't it was
unfortunately<00:02:11.930> was<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> drive<00:02:12.410> shaft<00:02:12.680> which

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
unfortunately was the drive shaft which

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.190 
unfortunately was the drive shaft which
sort<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.130> knowledge<00:02:14.000> our<00:02:14.600> filming<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.110> the

doing<00:02:36.790> low<00:02:36.910> passes<00:02:37.390> beside<00:02:37.690> me<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.530> was

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
doing low passes beside me that was

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.070 
doing low passes beside me that was
quite<00:02:38.920> hairy<00:02:39.330> given<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.540> bike<00:02:41.050> was

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
quite hairy given that the bike was

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.080 
quite hairy given that the bike was
incredibly<00:02:41.620> valuable<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.610> was<00:02:42.700> my<00:02:42.820> first

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
incredibly valuable and it was my first

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.110 
incredibly valuable and it was my first
time<00:02:43.270> out<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.760> know<00:02:45.820> we<00:02:46.030> were

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
time out on it and you know we were

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.720 
time out on it and you know we were
going<00:02:46.959> across<00:02:47.110> bumpy<00:02:47.590> ground<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.190> was<00:02:48.430> it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
going across bumpy ground and it was it

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.170 
going across bumpy ground and it was it
is<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> very<00:02:49.300> fast<00:02:49.600> bike<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.670> makes<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
is a very fast bike and it makes you

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.770 
is a very fast bike and it makes you
think<00:02:52.360> just<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:54.790> how<00:02:55.000> incredible<00:02:55.570> there's

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
think just just how incredible there's

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.380 
think just just how incredible there's
80<00:02:56.050> years<00:02:56.380> ago<00:02:56.440> more<00:02:57.220> than<00:02:57.280> 80<00:02:57.489> years<00:02:57.610> ago<00:02:57.970> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
80 years ago more than 80 years ago and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.470 
80 years ago more than 80 years ago and
um<00:02:59.070> you<00:03:00.070> know<00:03:00.100> if<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.730> performance<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
um you know if the performance of the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
um you know if the performance of the
brough<00:03:01.660> superior<00:03:01.810> must<00:03:02.380> have<00:03:02.500> made<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.890> other

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
brough superior must have made the other

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.509 
brough superior must have made the other
bikes<00:03:03.250> seemed<00:03:04.140> completely<00:03:05.160> adestria<00:03:06.160> you

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
bikes seemed completely adestria you

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.550 
bikes seemed completely adestria you
know<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.850> was<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.269> such<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> fantastic<00:03:08.080> thing

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560

know it was just such a fantastic thing
it<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.160> only<00:03:09.280> three<00:03:09.580> speed<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.360> second<00:03:10.750> go

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
it was only three speed but in second go

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.120 
it was only three speed but in second go
and<00:03:10.959> he<00:03:11.019> got<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.320> second<00:03:11.680> gear<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:11.980> was

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
and he got up the second gear it was

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.160 
and he got up the second gear it was
galloping<00:03:12.489> along<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.870> was<00:03:14.019> quite

using these machines you have the owner

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.940 
using these machines you have the owner
there<00:03:17.170> with<00:03:18.070> us<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:19.440> given<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.560> value<00:03:20.860> of

was<00:03:39.579> another<00:03:39.790> hairy<00:03:40.090> moments<00:03:40.540> appalling<00:03:41.260> that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
was another hairy moments appalling that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.680 
was another hairy moments appalling that
down<00:03:41.650> with<00:03:41.940> 1920s<00:03:42.940> brakes<00:03:43.239> wasn't<00:03:43.630> the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
down with 1920s brakes wasn't the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.920 
down with 1920s brakes wasn't the
easiest<00:03:43.930> thing<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.260> do<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:45.600> that's<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.750> lot<00:03:46.900> of

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
easiest thing to do but that's a lot of

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.050 
easiest thing to do but that's a lot of
Laurie<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.799> through<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.070> fence<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.549> down

Laurie to go through a fence and down
into<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.360> ditch<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.829> fortunately<00:03:51.280> we<00:03:51.370> didn't<00:03:51.610> we

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
into a ditch so fortunately we didn't we

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.620 
into a ditch so fortunately we didn't we
avoided<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:54.090> driving<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.209> earliest

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
avoided that driving the earliest

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.229 
avoided that driving the earliest
Bentley<00:03:55.989> in<00:03:56.110> existence<00:03:56.590> was<00:03:57.400> also<00:03:57.790> again<00:03:58.090> this

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
Bentley in existence was also again this

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.180 
Bentley in existence was also again this
is<00:03:58.390> all<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.840> know<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.620> value<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.980> these

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
is all you know the value of these

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.030 
is all you know the value of these
things<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.489> was<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.730> 1920s<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.540> course<00:04:02.040> free

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
things that was the 1920s of course free

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.000 
things that was the 1920s of course free
later<00:04:03.220> very<00:04:03.700> early<00:04:03.820> Bentley<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.600> was

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
later very early Bentley and that was

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.190 
later very early Bentley and that was
you<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.070> every<00:04:06.670> every<00:04:07.540> Grunch<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.140> the
