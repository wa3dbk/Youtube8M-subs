00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.190
 extend like the one that comes bundled with your playstation 3 systems

 caribbean vcb to ps3 system 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.870
 then connect the smaller terminal of lugo esteve to the bottom of the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.950

 On the red light flashes while the control battery is charging 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.640
 sector if you also bought control of the delegation sad the world 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.020
 you should repeat the previous steps for this control also before using 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.690
 these controls for the first time a good idea is to charge us until the light 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.000
 red of that department 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.510
 is very important and you disconnect the cable vs p before using the control of 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.510
 movement or navigation control 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.300
 now let's see another key part of the playstation move system 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.720
 the camera pleisteichon to him gillet both the movement of the sphere in the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.329
 top that movement control 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.329
 as well as the movements of the player's body 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.870
 this video will show you 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.840
 the best way to connect 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.749
 and place pleisteichon to go 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.629
 for a cotino operation 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.700
 the first step exposing the playstation camera to the panoramic mode 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.390
 this is achieved by turning the camera lens to the right so that the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.150
 white dot that is on the entity point towards the blue dot that is in 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.999
 the body of the camera you asked in addicts 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:46.629
 the panoramic mode will allow it to be nothing to follow the movements of the 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.260
 control over the widest possible area the next step is to place the 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.729
 camera you read stage near your TV 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.969
 the best place is that on the centerline of your TV 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.759
 above 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.590
 as below the screen 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.050
 whichever is closer to the reading of his works if they will go the camera to the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.219
 right today left 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.499
 until they incentivize the same direction that your TV screen avoids 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:22.180
 place the sad camera and siena ita on very bright surfaces or reflections 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.059
 because you could experience problems so the camera perceives those 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.059
 reflexes together with the movements of the player 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:36.169
 Also avoid moving the camera the distinction to the upward or downward 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.699
 down unless the game instructs you to do it 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:46.589
 to finish connecting the cable at the judgment of the textile chamber sinaí to your 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589

 maximum benefit to your experience 36 min 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:05.499
 first remember to use the safety belt of the motion control in 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.499
 your wrist every time you use it 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.799
 the best place to look for this is the time is an open environment and 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:14.839
 clear 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:19.329

 He held the control that this is confirmed to us while you light but not what 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.159
 move with too much sadness it works well in various conditions of 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.180
 illumination 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.360
 but the ideal is to minimize their direct sunlight 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.479
 the brightness and the amount of light behind the player 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.889
 you can usually adjust the lighting in the same way that 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.279
 would you do to watch television to a movie 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.270
 the playstation move games 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.759
 they require calibration and every time they are put into operation 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.759
 or every time a new player joins the game 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.249
 follow the instructions on the screen and they will tell you to point the control of 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.929

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.740
 calibration 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.870
 you can recalibrate at any time while you play while holding down 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.009
 the select button of the motion control and following the instructions 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.150
 from the screen 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.610
 finally remember to take frequent breaks while playing 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.159
 that's all you can already get out of this guide and start moving with the new 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.919
