00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
Cee'd which sort of showed how the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
Cee'd which sort of showed how the
growth<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.880> plant<00:01:25.310> occurred<00:01:26.659> within<00:01:27.659> those

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
an opening storm scene and the purpose

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.210 
an opening storm scene and the purpose
behind<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> sort<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> highlight<00:01:34.740> how

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
behind that is to sort of highlight how

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.999 
behind that is to sort of highlight how
what<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.299> might<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:36.930> destructive<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
what we might see as destructive like a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.080 
what we might see as destructive like a
very<00:01:38.549> violent<00:01:39.860> lightning<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.159> thunderstorm<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
very violent lightning a thunderstorm is

actually<00:01:42.810> sort<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.829> integral<00:01:45.079> component

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
actually sort of the integral component

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.469 
actually sort of the integral component
of<00:01:46.229> new<00:01:46.619> growth<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.399> plant<00:01:47.759> life<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:48.329> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
of new growth of plant life which is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.999 
of new growth of plant life which is
something<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.320> important<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> us

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
obviously been overshadowed in the past
few<00:03:55.740> years<00:03:55.800> with<00:03:56.220> Soren<00:03:56.790> which<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.210> sort<00:03:57.450> of

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
few years with Soren which is sort of

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.530 
few years with Soren which is sort of
like<00:03:57.740> it's<00:03:58.740> more<00:03:59.190> popular<00:03:59.580> older<00:04:00.270> brother

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
like it's more popular older brother

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.960 
like it's more popular older brother
ride<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> land<00:04:01.530> pavilion<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.580> think

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
ride in the land pavilion but I think

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.420 
ride in the land pavilion but I think
it's<00:04:03.120> definitely<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.750> fun<00:04:04.410> thing<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.770> go<00:04:05.070> on<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
it's definitely a fun thing to go on and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.580 
it's definitely a fun thing to go on and
ride<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.670> think<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.270> lines<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.750> usually<00:04:06.960> short

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
ride I think the lines are usually short

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.570 
ride I think the lines are usually short
because<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.610> no<00:04:08.850> Soren<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:11.130> it's<00:04:11.400> one

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
because it is no Soren and it's it's one

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.100 
because it is no Soren and it's it's one
of<00:04:11.700> those<00:04:11.820> rides<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.300> could<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.600> either<00:04:12.960> a

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
of those rides that could be either a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.590 
of those rides that could be either a
15-minute<00:04:14.100> break<00:04:14.130> for<00:04:14.640> your<00:04:14.760> feet<00:04:15.000> or<00:04:15.210> it

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
15-minute break for your feet or it

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.420 
15-minute break for your feet or it
could<00:04:15.810> be<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.710> really<00:04:16.950> fun<00:04:17.280> and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
could be you know a really fun and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.030 
could be you know a really fun and
entertaining<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:18.690> educational<00:04:19.140> experience

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
entertaining and educational experience

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.379 
entertaining and educational experience
and<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.640> do<00:04:20.700> think<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.270> I<00:04:21.299> say<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.810> many

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
and I do think and I say this in many

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.409 
and I do think and I say this in many
the<00:04:23.080> core<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.830> what<00:04:24.009> makes<00:04:24.039> Epcot<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:24.969> great<00:04:25.240> is

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
the core of what makes Epcot so great is

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.029 
the core of what makes Epcot so great is
that<00:04:25.449> it's<00:04:25.960> not<00:04:26.169> just<00:04:26.199> supposed<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.889> be

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
that it's not just supposed to be

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.679 
that it's not just supposed to be
entertaining<00:04:27.580> but<00:04:27.789> it's<00:04:27.939> also<00:04:28.120> supposed<00:04:28.419> to

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:28.689 
entertaining but it's also supposed to

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.050 
entertaining but it's also supposed to
be<00:04:28.840> educational<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:29.889> I<00:04:30.430> think<00:04:30.639> this<00:04:30.789> ride

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
be educational and I think this ride

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.529 
be educational and I think this ride
really<00:04:31.539> nails<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.210> hope<00:04:34.389> you've

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
really nails that so I hope you've

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.029
