00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
all the way at the other site and if

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.170 
all the way at the other site and if
they<00:01:33.020> play<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.350> smart<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:33.950> they<00:01:34.580> don't<00:01:34.760> try<00:01:35.150> to

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
they play it smart and they don't try to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.980 
they play it smart and they don't try to
hunt<00:01:35.420> me<00:01:35.570> down<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:36.380> all<00:01:36.740> 100%<00:01:37.840> lose<00:01:38.840> the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
hunt me down then all 100% lose the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.690 
hunt me down then all 100% lose the
round<00:01:39.110> because<00:01:40.010> they<00:01:40.130> could<00:01:40.280> just<00:01:40.430> kill<00:01:40.580> me

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
round because they could just kill me

while I'm defusing since it takes so
long<00:01:41.930> defuse<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.530> ball<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.610> they<00:01:43.700> could<00:01:43.820> just

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
long defuse the ball and they could just

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.280 
long defuse the ball and they could just
pick<00:01:44.060> me<00:01:44.150> one<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.420> time<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:44.930> right<00:01:45.080> there<00:01:45.260> I

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.600 
pick me one of the time so right there I
am<00:01:45.350> able<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.740> get<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.920> kill<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.130> him<00:01:46.370> so<00:01:46.520> I'm

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
am able to get the kill on him so I'm

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.890 
am able to get the kill on him so I'm
thinking<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.120> know<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.240> might<00:01:47.480> have<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.690> chance

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
thinking you know I might have a chance

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.060 
thinking you know I might have a chance
to<00:01:48.050> win<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.230> round<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.530> I'm<00:01:48.620> gonna<00:01:48.710> go<00:01:48.860> check

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
to win the round so I'm gonna go check

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.820 
to win the round so I'm gonna go check
it<00:01:49.220> out<00:01:49.310> had<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.270> killed<00:01:50.450> him<00:01:51.050> earlier<00:01:51.560> I

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
it out had I killed him earlier I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.020 
it out had I killed him earlier I
probably<00:01:51.860> would've<00:01:52.340> been<00:01:52.370> able<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.670> defuse

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
probably would've been able to defuse

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.880 
probably would've been able to defuse
but<00:01:53.750> since<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.020> did<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.320> really<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:54.710> have<00:01:54.860> to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
but since I did it I really just have to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.710 
but since I did it I really just have to
run<00:01:55.100> away<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.310> wouldn't<00:01:55.940> have<00:01:56.060> had<00:01:56.150> time<00:01:56.330> to

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
run away I wouldn't have had time to

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.480 
run away I wouldn't have had time to
defuse<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.229> bomb<00:01:57.380> right<00:01:57.530> there<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:59.170> you<00:02:00.170> know

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
defuse the bomb right there so you know

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.890 
defuse the bomb right there so you know
obviously<00:02:01.490> winning<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.210> round<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.540> number

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
obviously winning the round is number

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.950 
obviously winning the round is number
one<00:02:03.020> priority<00:02:03.440> but<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:04.210> knew<00:02:05.210> my<00:02:05.330> team<00:02:05.570> did<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:05.930> a

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
one priority but I knew my team did do a

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.580 
one priority but I knew my team did do a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I could get a pick and basically make it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
I could get a pick and basically make it
four<00:02:38.160> versus<00:02:38.430> live<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.480> making<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.780> four

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
four versus live but making it four

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.960 
four versus live but making it four
versus<00:02:40.170> five<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.770> just<00:02:41.100> allows<00:02:41.340> my<00:02:41.550> team<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
versus five it just allows my team to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.790 
versus five it just allows my team to
play<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.750> passively<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.710> to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
play more passively they don't have to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.050 
play more passively they don't have to
play<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> dangerously<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.880> set<00:02:45.030> up

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
play it dangerously and they get set up

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.920 
play it dangerously and they get set up
a<00:02:45.180> lot<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.360> cross<00:02:45.540> fires<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.880> basically<00:02:47.930> if

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
a lot of cross fires and basically if

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.100 
a lot of cross fires and basically if
they<00:02:49.080> set<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.380> lot<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> cross<00:02:49.770> fires<00:02:50.070> they

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
they set up a lot of cross fires they

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.420 
they set up a lot of cross fires they
well<00:02:52.110> what<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.380> want<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.800> happen<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.250> that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
well what we want to happen is that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.090 
well what we want to happen is that
nobody<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.820> get<00:02:53.970> counter<00:02:54.600> picked<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.950> made

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
nobody can get counter picked so we made

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.740 
nobody can get counter picked so we made
it<00:02:56.220> 45<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.060> basically<00:02:57.240> don't<00:02:57.570> want<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
it 45 and we basically don't want to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.390 
it 45 and we basically don't want to
make<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.960> four<00:02:58.140> before<00:02:58.500> by<00:02:58.920> lighting<00:02:59.130> one<00:02:59.310> of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
