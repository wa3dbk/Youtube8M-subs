 departure death a capture 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 well apparently the archives of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.950
 other thing update banks already 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.410
 it was updated was already 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.870
 introduction in the game or what is the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.310
 yacht that if we remember well there was a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.100
 mission that we had to do with 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.980
 michael de la cas and in the introduction 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 in the tutorial that was that I had to 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 pick up the daughter who was here with 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.010
 with some kids about not then it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 these hackers once again fine again 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.640
 they have left me speechless 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 managed to decipher some codes and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 add it to a capture and be able to put it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.010
 Well here, this is some textures 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.560
 solid not that you can step on how we are going to 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.960
 see now again and from 7 good I just 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.880
 to fall in order what is said that makes you 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.560
 you can put here you can shoot you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.630
 can go up everywhere and it's a 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.280
 game that the truth has left me with 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 my mouth open I'm freaking out now 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.550
 same because you can upload to all 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.530
 sides can come up here and this is a 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.070
 of the most of these is one of the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.280
 Let's say that we will see in the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.350
 robberies to banks and well yes it has 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.990
 left freaking out the truth the creator is 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.910
 that carlos with hd 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.820
 and I'll leave your channel the description too 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.800
 apart but as I say is a is a flip 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.920
 that you can put here on top of 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.530
 boats and such is pretty amazing the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.240
 ship from bank robberies and can 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 that later, nothing like here a 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.890
 as done a new series here that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.530
 It's code, maybe, as I said, 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.540
 make a future death here as if 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.550
 outside daughter that is not from ship to 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.330
 boat and that we start to shoot 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.850
 between us and make it a death and 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.890
 that we are each shooting hits and 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.840
 that we do here because I do not know about the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.150
 ours are cool to put on first 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.370
 person go moving I do not know what mission 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.890
 can be done here I do not know what we have 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.830
 to do the truth but it's pretty 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 cool this this boat I do not know if they have 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.710
 landed here and here you can 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.630
 land a helicopter and I do not know if here 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.790
 you will have to go to embroider we go down there 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.830
 if it did not reconsider remember well good 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.430
 for the one who has not done the mission of 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.840
 michael is very very very basic come 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.690
 here with the boat you can also come 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.090
 with a boat whatever you throw into the water 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.100
 and you go up, so you do not have to come 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.380
 with helicopter directly upload 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.120
 but you come here and you stretch to the 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.910
 water and you go back up to see if I 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.170
 you leave promised or you do not have to return 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.430
 to let rise 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.730
 you have to get up here by the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.730
 you see, and directly, you are 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.150
 above the boat of the yacht, well 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.760
 the girls are missing, we do not have boats here 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.640
 well so nothing else this has been the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.290
 super yacht of gta online of the robberies 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.820
