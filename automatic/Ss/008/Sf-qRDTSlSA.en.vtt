or four which we did yesterday and it

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.469 
or four which we did yesterday and it
was<00:00:42.769> great<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.190> hit<00:00:43.579> five<00:00:43.789> out<00:00:43.969> of<00:00:43.999> five<00:00:44.149> which

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.149 
was great I hit five out of five which
is<00:00:44.629> better<00:00:44.929> than<00:00:45.139> I<00:00:45.289> could<00:00:45.589> do<00:00:45.739> with<00:00:45.889> my<00:00:46.039> own

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
is better than I could do with my own

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.509 
is better than I could do with my own
gun<00:00:46.190> probably<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.620> I'll<00:00:48.620> sudden<00:00:49.039> bond<00:00:49.190> I<00:00:49.219> think

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
gun probably so I'll sudden bond I think

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.090 
gun probably so I'll sudden bond I think
we've<00:00:49.699> got<00:00:49.909> possibly<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.559> world's<00:00:51.949> most

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
we've got possibly the the world's most

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
with it so you can lumberjack Jeff

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.379 
with it so you can lumberjack Jeff
Johnson<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:00.319> killed<00:01:00.909> two<00:01:01.909> nice<00:01:02.119> tom
