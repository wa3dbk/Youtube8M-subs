00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
which I did a lot of research I was able

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.180 
which I did a lot of research I was able
to<00:04:36.490> work<00:04:37.450> with<00:04:37.630> my<00:04:37.870> tribes<00:04:38.170> cultural<00:04:38.740> center

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
to work with my tribes cultural center

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.550 
to work with my tribes cultural center
when<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:39.730> were<00:04:39.930> just<00:04:40.930> building<00:04:41.170> it<00:04:41.500> and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
when we were just building it and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.950 
when we were just building it and
getting<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:42.040> started<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:42.970> got<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.630> do<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.780> lot

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
getting it started so I got to do a lot

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.320 
getting it started so I got to do a lot
of<00:04:43.990> behind-the-scenes<00:04:44.440> research<00:04:45.280> for<00:04:45.790> for

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
of behind-the-scenes research for for

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.540 
of behind-the-scenes research for for
the<00:04:46.480> actual<00:04:46.870> cultural<00:04:47.380> centers<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:48.370> was<00:04:48.520> a

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
the actual cultural centers it was a

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.230 
the actual cultural centers it was a
whole<00:04:48.850> network<00:04:49.420> of<00:04:50.220> city<00:04:51.220> centers<00:04:51.640> basically

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
whole network of city centers basically

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.770 
whole network of city centers basically
in<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:53.050> Mississippian<00:04:53.770> period<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:55.630> those

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
in the Mississippian period and so those

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.750 
in the Mississippian period and so those
city<00:04:56.080> centers<00:04:56.590> would<00:04:56.860> have<00:04:57.070> these<00:04:57.340> copper

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
city centers would have these copper

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.720 
city centers would have these copper
working<00:04:58.120> areas<00:04:58.600> where<00:04:59.500> they<00:05:00.070> would<00:05:00.280> create

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
working areas where they would create

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.480 
working areas where they would create
these<00:05:01.030> amazing<00:05:01.260> sculptural<00:05:02.260> pieces<00:05:02.590> relief

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
these amazing sculptural pieces relief

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.420 
these amazing sculptural pieces relief
sculpture<00:05:03.940> pieces<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.750> so<00:05:04.990> I'm<00:05:05.470> doing<00:05:05.980> a

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
sculpture pieces and so I'm doing a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.880 
sculpture pieces and so I'm doing a
modern-day<00:05:07.110> technique<00:05:08.110> that's<00:05:08.320> similar<00:05:08.860> to

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
modern-day technique that's similar to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.800 
modern-day technique that's similar to
that<00:05:09.280> technique<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:09.940> they<00:05:09.970> were<00:05:10.120> doing<00:05:10.420> but

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
that technique that they were doing but

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.770 
that technique that they were doing but
with<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.080> modern<00:05:11.290> twist<00:05:11.520> mm-hmm<00:05:12.520> ryrie<00:05:13.360> and

you have a lot of barnacle influence in

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.740 
you have a lot of barnacle influence in
your<00:05:54.220> in<00:05:54.550> your<00:05:54.610> rank<00:05:55.030> this<00:05:55.180> is<00:05:55.330> best<00:05:55.570> with

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
your in your rank this is best with

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.870 
your in your rank this is best with
barnacle<00:05:56.260> black<00:05:56.440> diamonds<00:05:56.710> right<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.640> then<00:05:57.850> I

barnacle black diamonds right and then I

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.120 
barnacle black diamonds right and then I
stud<00:05:58.330> them<00:05:58.510> with<00:05:58.660> diamonds<00:05:59.470> so<00:05:59.620> these<00:05:59.770> pieces

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
stud them with diamonds so these pieces

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
stud them with diamonds so these pieces
I<00:06:00.670> actually<00:06:00.940> wax<00:06:01.630> carved<00:06:02.200> and<00:06:02.550> then<00:06:03.550> lost<00:06:03.820> wax

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
I actually wax carved and then lost wax

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.320 
I actually wax carved and then lost wax
cast<00:06:04.570> and<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:05.320> it's<00:06:05.440> all<00:06:05.620> by<00:06:05.920> hand<00:06:06.330> carpeting

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
cast and so it's all by hand carpeting

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.690 
cast and so it's all by hand carpeting
with<00:06:07.450> little<00:06:07.780> tiny<00:06:08.560> tools<00:06:08.890> like<00:06:09.130> dental<00:06:09.460> tools

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
with little tiny tools like dental tools

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.520 
with little tiny tools like dental tools
but<00:06:10.510> everything<00:06:10.900> is<00:06:11.020> everything<00:06:11.320> a<00:06:11.410> little

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
but everything is everything a little

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.990 
but everything is everything a little
different<00:06:12.040> would<00:06:12.160> you<00:06:12.280> say<00:06:12.460> each<00:06:12.700> piece

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
different would you say each piece

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.660 
different would you say each piece
because<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.690> or<00:06:14.080> well<00:06:15.070> these<00:06:15.280> barnacles

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
because of that or well these barnacles
