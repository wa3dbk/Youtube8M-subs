there

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.740 

this<00:02:15.319> machine<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.739> really<00:02:16.250> nice<00:02:16.459> use<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.540> as

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
this machine is really nice use this as

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.910 
this machine is really nice use this as
an<00:02:17.930> example<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:19.519> does<00:02:19.790> lift<00:02:20.440> almost<00:02:21.440> high

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
an example it does lift almost high

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.900 
an example it does lift almost high
enough<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:24.290> into<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> dump<00:02:24.950> truck<00:02:25.250> and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
enough to get into the dump truck and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.210 
enough to get into the dump truck and
don't<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:26.810> hits<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> rails<00:02:27.799> on<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.099> side

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
don't it just hits the rails on the side

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.520 
don't it just hits the rails on the side
of<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.580> bed<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.060> overall<00:02:29.360> really<00:02:29.830> nice<00:02:32.530> put

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
of the bed but overall really nice put

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.770 
of the bed but overall really nice put
those<00:02:33.739> down<00:02:35.620> then<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.799> got<00:02:36.950> your<00:02:37.190> exhaust<00:02:37.780> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
those down then you got your exhaust the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.020 
those down then you got your exhaust the
air<00:02:38.810> breather<00:02:40.329> access<00:02:41.329> panels<00:02:42.459> for<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> top

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
air breather access panels for the top

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.199

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
and Sun a little bit there we go then

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.780 
and Sun a little bit there we go then
you<00:03:02.000> got<00:03:02.180> what<00:03:03.110> would<00:03:03.290> be<00:03:03.470> for<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.220> don't<00:03:04.610> know

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
you got what would be for I don't know

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.369 
you got what would be for I don't know
if<00:03:04.849> these<00:03:04.970> machines<00:03:05.239> had<00:03:05.660> air<00:03:05.810> conditioning

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
if these machines had air conditioning

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.819 
if these machines had air conditioning
back<00:03:06.530> then<00:03:06.829> but<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.519> believe<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.390> would<00:03:08.690> be

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
back then but I believe that would be

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.729 
back then but I believe that would be
for<00:03:09.829> your<00:03:09.950> heat<00:03:10.160> also<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.989> let<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> air

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
for your heat also just to let the air

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.620 
for your heat also just to let the air
in

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
in

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.539 
in
it<00:03:14.630> does<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.850> skylight<00:03:16.850> up<00:03:17.120> top<00:03:17.480> there

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
it does have the skylight up top there

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.920 
it does have the skylight up top there
