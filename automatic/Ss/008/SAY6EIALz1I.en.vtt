here I musta gotten my bundles mixed up
in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.240> packages<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.340> um<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:29.240> is<00:02:29.390> how<00:02:29.570> it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
in the packages but um this is how it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.890 
in the packages but um this is how it
looks<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.010> 3.5<00:02:31.670> inch<00:02:32.090> bundles<00:02:32.630> which

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
looks this is a 3.5 inch bundles which

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.980 
looks this is a 3.5 inch bundles which
it<00:02:33.710> doesn't<00:02:34.250> really<00:02:34.430> seem<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.240> lot<00:02:35.630> that's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
it doesn't really seem like a lot that's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
it doesn't really seem like a lot that's
why<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.200> wouldn't<00:02:36.470> had<00:02:36.740> an<00:02:36.860> order<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.340> fourth

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
why I wouldn't had an order a fourth

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.940 
why I wouldn't had an order a fourth
bundle<00:02:38.030> typically<00:02:38.720> three<00:02:39.050> bundles<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.590> enough

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
bundle typically three bundles is enough

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.400 
bundle typically three bundles is enough
but<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:41.030> looking<00:02:41.360> at<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.780> said<00:02:42.050> let's<00:02:42.350> just

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
but just looking at it I said let's just

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.620 
but just looking at it I said let's just
go<00:02:42.650> with<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.950> four<00:02:43.130> bundle<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.240> be<00:02:44.360> safe

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
go with the four bundle just to be safe

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.450 
go with the four bundle just to be safe
and<00:02:44.960> I<00:02:45.140> ordered<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.620> fourth<00:02:45.890> bundle<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
and I ordered the fourth bundle and the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.850 
and I ordered the fourth bundle and the
26<00:02:46.970> inch<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:48.020> I'm<00:02:48.140> still<00:02:48.410> waiting<00:02:48.680> for<00:02:48.710> that

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
26 inch and I'm still waiting for that

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.900 
26 inch and I'm still waiting for that
to<00:02:49.100> arrive<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.480> how<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.660> hair<00:02:50.990> looks

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
to arrive but this is how the hair looks

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.040 
to arrive but this is how the hair looks
um<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.660> smells<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.459> guess<00:02:56.420> how<00:02:56.630> hair<00:02:56.900> would

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
um it smells like I guess how hair would

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.660 
um it smells like I guess how hair would
smell<00:02:59.740> not<00:03:00.740> really<00:03:01.070> anything<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.430> would

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
smell not really anything that would

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.910 
smell not really anything that would
probably<00:03:01.850> bother<00:03:02.300> me<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.720> will<00:03:03.170> wash<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.770> before

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
probably bother me I will wash it before

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.470 
probably bother me I will wash it before
I<00:03:04.190> install<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:08.150> shipping<00:03:08.690> was<00:03:09.550> standard<00:03:10.550> I

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
I install it the shipping was standard I

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.600 
I install it the shipping was standard I
think<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:12.020> probably<00:03:12.530> about<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.980> week<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.490> me

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
think it's probably about a week for me

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.670 
think it's probably about a week for me
to<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.980> 20<00:03:16.340> inch<00:03:16.520> bundle<00:03:19.480> and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
to get it this is the 20 inch bundle and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.920 
to get it this is the 20 inch bundle and
it<00:03:21.680> looks<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.100> those<00:03:22.489> ends<00:03:23.060> have<00:03:23.420> just<00:03:23.660> been

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
it looks like those ends have just been

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.080 
it looks like those ends have just been
cut<00:03:24.410> or<00:03:24.590> something<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.130> don't<00:03:25.280> know<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:25.850> I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
cut or something I don't know but I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.910 
cut or something I don't know but I
think<00:03:26.570> it's<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.959> bottom<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.560> hair<00:03:27.800> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
think it's the bottom of this hair it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.720 
think it's the bottom of this hair it
looks<00:03:28.160> really<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.660> 2<00:03:30.290> B<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.890> doesn't<00:03:31.459> look

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
looks really like a 2 B it doesn't look

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.240 
looks really like a 2 B it doesn't look
like<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.940> 1<00:03:32.300> B<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.050> that's<00:03:33.620> another<00:03:33.950> thing<00:03:34.040> that

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
like a 1 B so that's another thing that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.790 
like a 1 B so that's another thing that
I<00:03:34.430> noticed<00:03:35.050> um<00:03:36.050> and<00:03:36.440> then<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:38.800> let's

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
I noticed um and then this is the let's

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.190 
I noticed um and then this is the let's
thing<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:46.400> then<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.239> 24<00:03:47.870> inch

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
thing and then this is the 24 inch

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.270 
thing and then this is the 24 inch
bundle<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.930> again<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.320> can<00:03:51.530> see<00:03:51.830> why<00:03:52.250> I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
bundle and again you can see why I

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.670 
bundle and again you can see why I
decided<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.209> go<00:03:53.299> ahead<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.690> order<00:03:53.900> one<00:03:54.650> more

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
decided to go ahead and order one more

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.870 
decided to go ahead and order one more
bundle<00:03:55.280> because<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.970> bundles<00:03:57.610> didn't<00:03:58.610> seem

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
bundle because the bundles didn't seem

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.020 
bundle because the bundles didn't seem
really<00:03:59.209> full<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.980> can't<00:04:01.370> wait<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.790> get<00:04:01.880> this
