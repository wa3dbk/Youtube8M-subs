so we're in the gallery that is looking

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.980 
so we're in the gallery that is looking
very<00:00:05.100> closely<00:00:05.460> at<00:00:05.670> work<00:00:06.029> made<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.660> 1990s

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990

which<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.040> course<00:00:08.099> has<00:00:08.400> become<00:00:08.700> very

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
which of course has become very

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.850 
which of course has become very
synonymous<00:00:09.570> with<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.290> young<00:00:10.500> British

Spitalfields in this painting he depicts

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.150 
Spitalfields in this painting he depicts
the<00:00:46.480> church<00:00:46.690> leaning<00:00:47.140> very<00:00:47.440> heavily<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
the church leaning very heavily to the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.340 
the church leaning very heavily to the
right<00:00:48.400> in<00:00:48.760> order<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:49.180> allow<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:50.050> sort<00:00:50.290> of

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
right in order to allow the sort of

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.470 
right in order to allow the sort of
social<00:00:50.770> fabric<00:00:51.160> if<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:51.640> like<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.030> city<00:00:52.239> to

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
social fabric if you like of the city to

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.510 
social fabric if you like of the city to
emerge<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.750> think<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.110> very<00:00:56.520> energetic

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
emerge and I think the very energetic

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.540 
emerge and I think the very energetic
brushwork<00:00:58.120> really<00:00:58.870> does<00:00:59.050> suggest<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.710> time

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
brushwork really does suggest that time

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.819 
brushwork really does suggest that time
is<00:01:01.180> really<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.600> essence<00:01:02.079> that<00:01:02.560> it<00:01:02.680> won't

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
is really of the essence that it won't

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.010 
is really of the essence that it won't
be<00:01:02.980> too<00:01:03.220> long<00:01:03.430> before<00:01:03.700> churches<00:01:04.570> like<00:01:04.780> this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
be too long before churches like this

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.100 
be too long before churches like this
become<00:01:05.920> surrounded<00:01:06.190> by<00:01:06.850> new<00:01:07.420> office<00:01:07.810> blocks

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
become surrounded by new office blocks

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.859 
become surrounded by new office blocks
and<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.100> their<00:01:09.220> characters<00:01:09.729> will<00:01:09.910> be<00:01:09.940> lost

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
and that their characters will be lost

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.650 
and that their characters will be lost
forever<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.700> very<00:01:12.940> interesting<00:01:13.210> that<00:01:13.420> we've

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
forever it's very interesting that we've

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.260 
forever it's very interesting that we've
tried<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:14.110> juxtapose<00:01:14.500> an<00:01:15.130> older<00:01:15.700> artist's
