 a little bit of the gameplay of team fortress 2 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 to talk a little about the draw but before 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
 What are you seeing there is a game? 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.600
 mm was the last mission left 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 for me to complete the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.080
 hospital and earn a strange boat 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 You will see it winning there in the end then 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.679
 You can follow this is the last one. 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.730
 event brought a few moments but I 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.110
 I wanted to talk a little bit about the draw. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.270
 who I do not know the tava rolling 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.980
 draw is still rolling draw here 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 on the channel where the crew had to send 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.079
 screenshots and there had prizes like 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.530
 who is and has strange digital 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.820
 So I had a certain problem and this 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.239
 promotion was scheduled to be 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.039
 closed Sunday but unfortunately 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.110
 I could not make the video showing 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 the screenshots and saying that the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.280
 players the winners sorry, I do not even 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 so I'm giving a radiated I 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.610
 I count on your understanding 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.960
 thank you in advance for understanding and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.630
 It's going to be the car I 'm about to go 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.119
 in more detail but the fact is that in the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.740
 moment it came out black ops that I take quite a lot 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.000
 of my time we will say that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.549
 I really liked the game, who's there? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.780
 accompanying nine games in 3d place no 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.000
 I'm going to be alone in the black ops. 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.250
 strong enough but also stay 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.750
 tranquil kingdom has strong others these 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.580
 games that I continued to bet on 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.430
 keep posting was only in this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 first holiday weekend right to kill a little 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 hype kill a little of the longing that I 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.130
 It was safe because it's mw3 for me. 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.960
 it was not with the costumes did not have the factor 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 addictive set up has that I 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.729
 I missed you so I was part of it. 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
 this and the other part because besides 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.329
 work eight hours a day as 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.860
 any normal person I still 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.200
 they are doing a course of illustration that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.759
 It's a fuck that's with an international face . 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.530
 I paid a little more money to 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.270
 do this course so I have to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 to dedicate logically I even needed 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.939
 think it was a third party playing in a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.130
 image of part of my homework there 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.840
 You do not have homework every week. 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.899
 new is the one you'll see on screen 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.180
 was part 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.799
 and the very demanding guy, I do not have 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.780
 My profession is quite difficult. 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.489
 is directly with the illustrator the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.150
 I work with graphic Am formed in 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.530
 design 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.209
 but that's one thing I know it's going to 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.189
 add a lot to my career and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.780
 will also be able in the end to reflect a 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.220
 little in the channel can bring some 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.299
 some drawings some illustrations 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.129
 cool 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.870
 Anyway, I think it can complement a 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.819
 bit the channel as I always did 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.040
 I try to bring some kind of 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.920
 complementation is not with these other 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.720
 knowledge that I am acquiring 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.180
 so that's why I was a little late 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.950
 but I'll make up for my delay and I 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.790
 I'm going to increase the prize and I'm going to give one more 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.129
 winner 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.269
 so it's more or less this was the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.819
 main reason I 'm doing 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.440
 this video and why I'm going to increase 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.819
 prizes are seeing there like I said in 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.400
 a match of mm 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.170
 where I'm going to win a strange boat 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 I'm already going to try to track the boat. 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.200
 selective in me there will be the demo 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.599
 secondary that is the good stick right and I already 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 had a strange stick-pump then 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.569
 or I now have a boat that he sic 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.239
 bomb and one is only stress quilombo I do not 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.510
 I need the two or have a certain 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.489
 appreciation team fortress people 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.379
 mainly by boat killers 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.810
 I think cool the weapons at last like 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.449
 play and mc5 good was the first one I 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.949
 acquired by own merit is not of the 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.720
 my boots killers 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:32.540
 So I'm not going to leave her, but mine. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.519

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.079
 more need to be with her then 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.620
