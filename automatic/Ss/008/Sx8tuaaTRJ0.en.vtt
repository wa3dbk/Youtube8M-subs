hey there I just wanted to be one of the
many<00:00:03.689> people<00:00:04.020> who'd<00:00:04.170> be<00:00:04.290> talking<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
many people who'd be talking about the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.190 
many people who'd be talking about the
zombie<00:00:05.670> map<00:00:05.879> called<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.109> Dead<00:00:07.519> I<00:00:08.519> just<00:00:09.360> wanted

zombie map called the Dead I just wanted

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.570 
zombie map called the Dead I just wanted
to<00:00:10.290> see<00:00:10.650> if<00:00:10.679> there<00:00:10.889> was<00:00:10.950> anything<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to see if there was anything in the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.310 
to see if there was anything in the
picture<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.330> given<00:00:12.660> out<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
picture that was given out in the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.490 
picture that was given out in the
multiplayer<00:00:14.070> review<00:00:14.730> trailer<00:00:15.230> for<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
multiplayer review trailer for the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
multiplayer review trailer for the
escalation<00:00:17.190> map<00:00:17.910> pack<00:00:18.210> thing<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.400> noticed

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
escalation map pack thing but I noticed

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.650 
escalation map pack thing but I noticed
a<00:00:21.449> few<00:00:22.320> things<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> picture<00:00:23.420> one<00:00:24.420> was

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a few things in the picture one was

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.460 
a few things in the picture one was
obviously<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.740> lighthouse<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.470> it's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
obviously the lighthouse so it's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.580 
obviously the lighthouse so it's
probably<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.260> significant<00:00:31.260> thing

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
probably going to be a significant thing

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.150 
probably going to be a significant thing
in<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> map<00:00:32.040> map<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:32.969> whatever<00:00:33.800> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
in the map map or whatever this is not a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.690 
in the map map or whatever this is not a
very<00:00:35.340> good<00:00:35.430> commentary<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
very good commentary I know it is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.139 
very good commentary I know it is
because<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> very<00:00:39.450> good<00:00:39.540> commentator

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
because I'm not a very good commentator

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.600 
because I'm not a very good commentator
out<00:00:42.149> onto<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> map<00:00:42.690> pack<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
out onto the map pack it was if you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
out onto the map pack it was if you
notice<00:00:44.969> above<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.690> lighthouse<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
notice above the lighthouse there's a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
notice above the lighthouse there's a
light<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> looks<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
light that looks just like the one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.209 
light that looks just like the one
that's<00:00:48.690> emitted<00:00:48.960> from<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> mystery<00:00:49.710> box<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that's emitted from the mystery box to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.380 
that's emitted from the mystery box to
let<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.579> where<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.969> going<00:00:53.969> off<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
let you know where it is so going off of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.819 
let you know where it is so going off of
that<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> looks<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.289> might<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.620> able<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that it looks like we might be able to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
that it looks like we might be able to
get<00:00:56.010> into<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> lighthouse<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:58.379> means<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
get into the lighthouse that means the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
get into the lighthouse that means the
mystery<00:00:58.890> box<00:00:59.010> could<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> top<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
mystery box could be at the top or the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.539 
mystery box could be at the top or the
bottom<00:01:01.699> no<00:01:02.699> idea<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:04.830> looks<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.400> at

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
bottom no idea and it also looks like at

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
bottom no idea and it also looks like at
the<00:01:05.640> base<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.119> lighthouses<00:01:06.590> platforms

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the base of the lighthouses platforms

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.660 
the base of the lighthouses platforms
where<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> could<00:01:08.010> walk<00:01:08.340> around<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:10.670> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
where you could walk around on and so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
where you could walk around on and so
that<00:01:11.850> could<00:01:12.030> lead<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.720> somehow<00:01:13.200> getting

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that could lead to you somehow getting

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.880 
that could lead to you somehow getting
to<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> lighthouse<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.890> if

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to the lighthouse I don't know and if

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.140 
to the lighthouse I don't know and if
you<00:01:16.979> look<00:01:17.009> around<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.520> map<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:18.000> are

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you look around the map there are

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.679 
you look around the map there are
icicles<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.409> snowing<00:01:20.240> which<00:01:21.240> indicates

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
icicles and it's snowing which indicates

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.320 
icicles and it's snowing which indicates
somewhere<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.229> north<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.820> did<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> little

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
somewhere up north and I did a little

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.890 
somewhere up north and I did a little
bit<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> research<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.530> much<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.400> i<00:01:26.729> found<00:01:27.659> out

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
bit of research not much but i found out

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
bit of research not much but i found out
that<00:01:27.960> Russia<00:01:28.560> had<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> chain<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> lighthouses

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that Russia had a chain of lighthouses

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.789 
that Russia had a chain of lighthouses
that<00:01:31.409> winter<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.490> along<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> north<00:01:33.329> side

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
that winter up along the north side

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:41.359 
that winter up along the north side
laughs<00:01:35.810> mom<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.409> guide<00:01:37.939> ship<00:01:38.939> people<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.189> I

laughs mom to guide ship people and I
suck<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:41.939> things<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:43.380> um<00:01:44.570> yeah<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
suck at these things but um yeah so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.999 
suck at these things but um yeah so
there<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.350> lots<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.829> light

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
there you go they have lots of light

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.580 
there you go they have lots of light
houses<00:01:47.340> along<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.579> north<00:01:47.909> side<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.210> Russia

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
houses along the north side of Russia

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
houses along the north side of Russia
because<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:50.009> would<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:51.000> time<00:01:51.299> span<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
because they would have a time span of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.210 
because they would have a time span of
about<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.960> hundred<00:01:52.140> days<00:01:52.500> where<00:01:52.740> there'd<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.009> no

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
about a hundred days where there'd be no

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.030 
about a hundred days where there'd be no
daylight<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.500> they<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.649> needed

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
daylight at all and they also needed

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
daylight at all and they also needed
light<00:01:56.310> houses<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.790> weren't<00:01:56.969> manned<00:01:57.450> by

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
light houses that weren't manned by

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.330 
light houses that weren't manned by
people<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> couldn't<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.649> people

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
people because you couldn't have people

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
people because you couldn't have people
manning<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.210> these<00:02:00.329> lighthouses

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
manning all of these lighthouses

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.980 
manning all of these lighthouses
constantly<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:03.119> tried<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:03.689> like

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
constantly so they tried to make like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.740 
constantly so they tried to make like
self<00:02:04.439> automated<00:02:04.979> lighthouses<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:06.570> did

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
self automated lighthouses and they did

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.199 
self automated lighthouses and they did
that<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.200> using<00:02:07.409> atomic<00:02:08.250> power<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:09.060> they

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that by using atomic power because they

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.470 
that by using atomic power because they
had<00:02:09.509> light-armed<00:02:10.910> atomic<00:02:11.910> generators<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
had light-armed atomic generators that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.830 
had light-armed atomic generators that
they<00:02:12.750> put<00:02:12.900> into<00:02:13.020> each<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.500> of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
they put into each one of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.240 
they put into each one of
these<00:02:13.959> lighthouses<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:18.269> yeah<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:20.410> just

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
these lighthouses and so yeah I just

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.320 
these lighthouses and so yeah I just
kind<00:02:21.519> of<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.700> lost<00:02:21.879> my<00:02:22.000> train<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> thought

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
kind of like lost my train of thought

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.190 
kind of like lost my train of thought
but<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:25.290> yeah<00:02:26.290> moving<00:02:26.739> on<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.900> else<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.170> I

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
and i forgot to mention that on these

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.180 
and i forgot to mention that on these
one<00:03:01.060> group<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.840> people<00:03:02.560> when<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:02.980> went<00:03:03.160> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
one group of people when they went to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.339 
one group of people when they went to
investigate<00:03:03.430> one<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.060> flight<00:03:04.239> houses<00:03:04.660> the

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
investigate one of the flight houses the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.069 
investigate one of the flight houses the
people<00:03:05.980> had<00:03:06.099> were<00:03:06.280> written<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.879> word

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
people had were written the word

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.890 
people had were written the word
radioactivity<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> path<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.750> get

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
radioactivity in the path of like to get

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.509 
radioactivity in the path of like to get
to<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.140> lighthouse<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:13.829> yeah<00:03:14.829> so<00:03:15.280> i<00:03:15.310> think

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
to the lighthouse and yeah so i think

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.780 
to the lighthouse and yeah so i think
that's<00:03:16.440> probably<00:03:17.440> where<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.130> location<00:03:18.459> of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
that's probably where the location of

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.819 
that's probably where the location of
the<00:03:18.910> net<00:03:19.090> calm<00:03:19.420> call<00:03:20.079> of<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.319> dead<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.650> going

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
the net calm call of the dead is going

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.979 
the net calm call of the dead is going
to<00:03:20.889> be<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.940> going<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.389> be<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
to be is going to be one of the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.750 
to be is going to be one of the
lighthouses<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.680> Russia<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:27.160> i<00:03:27.250> also<00:03:27.400> had

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
lighthouses of Russia but and i also had

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.710 
lighthouses of Russia but and i also had
heard<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.720> few<00:03:29.139> things<00:03:29.200> about<00:03:29.560> bosses<00:03:30.720> where

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
heard a few things about bosses where

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.990 
heard a few things about bosses where
it'd<00:03:31.870> be<00:03:31.900> kind<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.500> like<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.980> dogs<00:03:33.639> are

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
it'd be kind of like the dogs are

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.960 
it'd be kind of like the dogs are
monkeys<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:35.590> every<00:03:35.920> five<00:03:36.069> rounds<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.910> it's

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
monkeys like every five rounds but it's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.150 
monkeys like every five rounds but it's
just<00:03:37.450> one<00:03:37.750> boss<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.380> lot<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.739> health<00:03:38.889> or

something like that I've just heard that

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.909 
something like that I've just heard that
from<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.950> few<00:03:42.130> sources<00:03:42.340> um<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:46.650> well<00:03:47.650> maybe

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
from a few sources um then well maybe

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.159 
from a few sources um then well maybe
the<00:03:48.579> light<00:03:48.760> from<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.090> lighthouse<00:03:49.389> could<00:03:49.930> call

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
the light from the lighthouse could call

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.589 
the light from the lighthouse could call
the<00:03:50.349> boss<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:51.849> come<00:03:52.389> I<00:03:52.900> don't<00:03:53.500> know<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:54.700> hinting

side<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.740> picture<00:04:28.280> on<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.610> lighthouse

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
side of this picture on the lighthouse

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.710 
side of this picture on the lighthouse
there<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:31.250> looks<00:04:31.760> like<00:04:31.910> Russian<00:04:32.360> writing

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
there is it looks like Russian writing

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.130 
there is it looks like Russian writing
and<00:04:33.080> then<00:04:33.860> if<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.190> look<00:04:34.400> on<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:34.670> looks<00:04:34.940> like<00:04:35.090> a

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
and then if you look on it looks like a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.930 
and then if you look on it looks like a
electricity<00:04:36.140> symbol<00:04:36.440> pointing<00:04:36.740> down<00:04:36.920> kind<00:04:37.910> of

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
electricity symbol pointing down kind of

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.300 
electricity symbol pointing down kind of
like<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.240> ones<00:04:38.420> in<00:04:38.540> zombies<00:04:38.960> like<00:04:39.200> power<00:04:39.980> this

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
like the ones in zombies like power this

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.050 
like the ones in zombies like power this
way<00:04:41.200> so<00:04:42.200> maybe<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.980> electricity<00:04:43.580> is<00:04:43.730> at<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
way so maybe the electricity is at the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.820 
way so maybe the electricity is at the
bottom<00:04:44.450> of<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.960> lighthouse<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:45.740> you

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
bottom of the lighthouse and then you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.530 
bottom of the lighthouse and then you
turn<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.550> climb<00:04:46.910> up<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.090> lighthouse

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
turn it on and climb up the lighthouse

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.430 
turn it on and climb up the lighthouse
I'm<00:04:48.500> not<00:04:48.860> sure<00:04:50.140> then<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.890> have<00:04:52.100> um<00:04:53.290> what<00:04:54.290> was

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440
