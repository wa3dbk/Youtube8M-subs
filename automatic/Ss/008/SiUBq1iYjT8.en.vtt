00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.819
 today we tested the sensor of something relieved and crankshaft in this month before baltimore 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.269
 2004 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.170
 promoter of 2 points 4 and approximately 58 thousand miles east 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.600
 vehicle also has a cable accelerator system that has 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 accumulation of charges in which we will do the body and the term of the regulator of 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.630
 acceleration after this service may be necessary at home with the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.500
 procedure to start 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.950
 The new record and air control min 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.030
 According to the service bulletin the descamps instrument of the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.650
 factory to specify this procedure 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.480
 we will show started alternative 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.530
 anyone can do it 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.630
 without tools crankshaft sensors guiding boulevard has outlines 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.160
 almost identical electric 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.020
 the only differences are two trains that connect to the computer 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.109
 in fact both are technical number of parts for each vehicle 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.190
 so both are tested in the same way 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.860
 sun a team of young people is producing with the digital signal 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.100
 to be operated according to xix 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.970
 for an exact analysis this signal should be tested only with it the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.170
 shooting guard 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.960
 check the center theater or censorship signal as on this day of 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.970
 love 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 available on our website 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.399
 efe the scale of values â€‹â€‹of more than 12 volts the higher the voltage 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.120
 smaller is the employer 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.409
 this case a decline of some debt in that vehicle 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.810
 it is a pulse of one 3 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 4 2 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.390
 identifying 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.540
 for a century 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.720
 paez of revolutions per minute we find the best adjustment in 200 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.369
 Thousandths of a second 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.959
 for each division 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.299
 to see the passage a complex 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.389
 if we put a lower dimension show less case 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.529
 but it will give more details 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.120
 the crankshaft sensor is located 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.810
 a very difficult position 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.069
 despite this the central engine block near the transactions 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.170
 as you can see in our mirror overlaying the general 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.290
 security and lion can be a useful tool to diagnose a 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.529
 One hundred percent belt failure 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.800
 both emitters 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.049
 they are working correctly 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.279
 we explore more detailed techniques of enthusiastic things 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:51.999
 as can be seen 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.679
 the silver cleaning of the throttle in this vehicle this 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 work is relatively simple 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.780
 when the minimum acceleration increases 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.629
 after 2010 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.919
 this work can become a nightmare 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.289
 the hustle and bustle of previous services to a child accelerating jalisco 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.409
 could explode p os 5 0 7 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.629
 indicates 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.020
 to return the minimum normal acceleration again 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.380
 must be used 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.459
 the sarika scanner 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.810
 the party an alternative method 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.159
 after extensive tas 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.599
 the engine and the transmission must be attentive in turn functioning 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.329
 two 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.329
 The current charging system must work properly 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.640
 the broadcast 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.640
 must be at peace with the other 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.529
 all loads of girls must be at peace 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.789
 and the view wheel of said 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.789
 when all these parameters are met 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.479
 put in your xv edition then oppose 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.819
 for three seconds and then all for 10 seconds 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.579
 receiving those three months 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.769
 put your extension 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.959
 then again for three seconds 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.059
 and three from the tips of your fingers 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.099
 and luck not five months for five weeks 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.199
 that's why it has the accelerator 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.220
 I waited 7 seconds and appreciate it thoroughly 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.249
 and keep it there 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.150
 after about ten seconds 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.129
 l with those apart 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.559
 if they do not do it because according to them 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:43.559
 start the process again 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.300
 ld the carp of aralar about 10 seconds 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.320
 and then 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.719
 they will be put in common in a constant 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.129
 then luck the accelerator 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.180
 between seconds the engine starts 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.860
 but the registration process is successful 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.629
 note 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.930
 a dramatic drop in revolutions per minute 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.319
 as you can see 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.699
 that's why the power is ready to go 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.490
 we must again again in the garage emerging in general
