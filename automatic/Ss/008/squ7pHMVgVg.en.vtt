00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:12.980 

here's<00:00:00.480> some<00:00:00.780> with<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.110> saturator<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:12.240> also

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
here's some with the saturator and also

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.410 
here's some with the saturator and also
the<00:00:13.110> time<00:00:13.290> machine<00:00:13.700> I'll<00:00:14.700> tell<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.000> would

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the time machine I'll tell you I would

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.330 
the time machine I'll tell you I would
I'll<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.839> I'll<00:00:15.990> put<00:00:16.170> them<00:00:16.289> I'll<00:00:17.100> take<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
I'll do is I'll put them I'll take the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.269 
I'll do is I'll put them I'll take the
time<00:00:17.520> machine<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.410> there's<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.590> without<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
time machine off there's it without the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:30.310 
time machine off there's it without the
delay<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.390> here's

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.359 

we<00:00:31.320> turn<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> down

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
we turn it down

00:00:32.369 --> 00:01:12.649 
we turn it down
here<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.579> go

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.810 

so<00:01:13.659> that's<00:01:13.899> without<00:01:14.079> any<00:01:14.549> delay

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
so that's without any delay

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:26.880 
so that's without any delay
that's<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.509> saturator

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:02:09.350 

and<00:01:27.890> here's<00:01:28.190> what<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.670> delay

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:50.230 

the<00:02:10.360> neck<00:02:10.539> pickup

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.430 

so<00:02:51.240> there<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.510> go<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.140> delay

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
so there you go that's what the delay

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.430 
so there you go that's what the delay
and<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> saturator<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:57.440> neck

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and with the saturator in the neck

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.770 
and with the saturator in the neck
position<00:02:58.970> let's<00:02:59.970> try<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.180> big<00:03:00.360> back<00:03:00.540> wall

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
position let's try the big back wall

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080 
position let's try the big back wall
it'll<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.230> I've<00:03:01.770> got<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.160> on<00:03:02.220> wah

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it'll bit I've got it on wah

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:48.920 
it'll bit I've got it on wah
I<00:03:03.120> guess<00:03:04.050> wah<00:03:04.260> one<00:03:05.000> let's<00:03:06.000> try<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.270> few<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.660> these

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.270 

let's<00:03:49.930> try<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.530> different<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.950> little<00:03:51.010> bit<00:03:51.130> of

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
let's try a different a little bit of

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.590 
let's try a different a little bit of
setting<00:03:52.030> let's<00:03:52.180> go<00:03:52.300> wat<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:57.390> quite<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.420> bit<00:03:58.570> a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
setting let's go wat to quite a bit a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:41.090 
setting let's go wat to quite a bit a
difference<00:03:59.020> there

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.250 

so<00:04:42.100> there's<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.370> little<00:04:42.580> bit<00:04:42.699> of<00:04:42.820> water<00:04:43.260> let's

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
so there's a little bit of water let's

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.689 
so there's a little bit of water let's
try<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.470> with<00:04:44.590> walk<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.280> we'll<00:04:45.400> hit<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
try it with walk to and we'll hit the

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.400 
try it with walk to and we'll hit the
voice<00:04:45.880> there's<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.720> voice<00:04:46.900> there's<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.229> voice

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
voice there's a voice there's a voice

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.189 
voice there's a voice there's a voice
which<00:04:47.710> let<00:04:48.699> me<00:04:48.760> show<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:51.900> there's<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.960> voice

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
which let me show you there's a voice

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.830 
which let me show you there's a voice
which<00:04:53.530> there<00:04:53.949> right<00:04:54.940> now<00:04:55.120> it's<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.510> me<00:04:55.690> turn

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
which there right now it's on me turn

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.469 
which there right now it's on me turn
this<00:04:55.960> down<00:04:56.199> right<00:04:56.889> now<00:04:57.040> it's<00:04:57.250> on<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.460> C<00:04:58.360> the

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
this down right now it's on the C the

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.879 
this down right now it's on the C the
inductor<00:04:58.930> that's<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.260> different<00:04:59.560> inductor

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
inductor that's a different inductor

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.580 
inductor that's a different inductor
there's<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.160> USA<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:02.669> UK<00:05:03.990> inductor<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.200> guess

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
there's a USA and a UK inductor I guess

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.400 
there's a USA and a UK inductor I guess
that's<00:05:05.800> what<00:05:05.950> makes<00:05:06.190> the
