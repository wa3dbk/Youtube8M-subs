00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
show you how you can detect players in

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.480 
show you how you can detect players in
Minecraft<00:00:25.240> not<00:00:25.560> mobs<00:00:26.560> not<00:00:26.770> anything<00:00:27.340> that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
Minecraft not mobs not anything that

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.090 
Minecraft not mobs not anything that
would<00:00:28.180> just<00:00:28.869> players<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.619> no<00:00:29.830> pressure

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
would just players and no pressure

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.090 
would just players and no pressure
plates<00:00:30.400> no<00:00:30.699> trip<00:00:31.269> wires<00:00:31.480> anything<00:00:32.050> they<00:00:32.890> just

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
plates no trip wires anything they just

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.560 
plates no trip wires anything they just
have<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.280> walk<00:00:33.519> in<00:00:33.699> there's<00:00:33.910> certain<00:00:34.420> diameter

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
have to walk in there's certain diameter

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.650 
have to walk in there's certain diameter
of<00:00:34.960> an<00:00:35.050> object<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.590> it<00:00:35.829> will<00:00:35.920> activate<00:00:36.430> okay

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
of an object and it will activate okay

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.150 
of an object and it will activate okay
activate<00:00:38.230> redstone<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:38.770> then<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:38.980> can<00:00:39.100> do

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
activate redstone so then you can do

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.350 
activate redstone so then you can do
whatever<00:00:39.340> you<00:00:39.489> want<00:00:39.610> with<00:00:39.730> it<00:00:39.910> anyway<00:00:40.210> I'm

gonna show you that right now here's an

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.459 
gonna show you that right now here's an
example<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.210> what's<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.840> in<00:00:43.960> his<00:00:44.020> distance

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
example so what's that in his distance

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.580 
example so what's that in his distance
Oh<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:45.370> redstone<00:00:45.880> lamp<00:00:46.239> well<00:00:47.020> nothing<00:00:47.500> could

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
Oh a redstone lamp well nothing could

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.470 
Oh a redstone lamp well nothing could
possibly<00:00:48.160> happen<00:00:48.399> if<00:00:48.610> I<00:00:48.700> walk<00:00:48.879> close<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.360> it

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
possibly happen if I walk close to it

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.260 
possibly happen if I walk close to it
there's<00:00:49.690> no<00:00:49.899> pressure<00:00:50.469> plate<00:00:50.800> or<00:00:50.950> anything

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
there's no pressure plate or anything

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.970 
there's no pressure plate or anything
okay<00:00:52.270> I'll<00:00:52.420> just<00:00:52.570> walk<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.809> bit<00:00:53.079> closer<00:00:53.379> oh<00:00:53.590> whoa

okay I'll just walk a bit closer oh whoa

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.819 
okay I'll just walk a bit closer oh whoa
for<00:00:54.969> some<00:00:55.239> reason<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:55.750> just<00:00:55.780> lit<00:00:56.170> up<00:00:56.350> because<00:00:56.739> I

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
for some reason it just lit up because I

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.910 
for some reason it just lit up because I
was<00:00:56.980> too<00:00:57.219> close<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.000> well<00:00:58.840> guys<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.410> is<00:00:59.739> my

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
was too close to it well guys this is my

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.100 
was too close to it well guys this is my
player<00:01:00.219> detector<00:01:00.699> as<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:00.969> can<00:01:01.090> see<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.750> lit<00:01:02.079> up

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
player detector as you can see it lit up

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.740 
player detector as you can see it lit up
because<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.649> went<00:01:03.010> with<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.370> diameter<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:04.059> 16

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
because I went with a diameter of 16

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.499 
because I went with a diameter of 16
blocks<00:01:05.079> to<00:01:05.350> it<00:01:05.469> I<00:01:06.399> have<00:01:06.999> a<00:01:07.029> look<00:01:07.329> inside

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
blocks to it I have a look inside

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.859 
blocks to it I have a look inside
basically<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:09.549> actually<00:01:10.119> a<00:01:10.299> few<00:01:10.569> mob

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
basically there's actually a few mob

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.899 
basically there's actually a few mob
spawners<00:01:11.259> that<00:01:11.770> were<00:01:11.829> spawning<00:01:12.100> pigs<00:01:12.459> onto

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
spawners that were spawning pigs onto

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.300 
spawners that were spawning pigs onto
the<00:01:12.999> only<00:01:13.240> block<00:01:13.659> of<00:01:13.810> grass<00:01:14.049> which<00:01:14.920> is<00:01:15.069> covered

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
the only block of grass which is covered

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.999 
the only block of grass which is covered
by<00:01:15.429> pressure<00:01:15.729> plate<00:01:15.939> over<00:01:16.119> here<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:17.009> mob

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
by pressure plate over here and mob

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.339 
by pressure plate over here and mob
spawners<00:01:18.310> only<00:01:18.789> work<00:01:19.029> when<00:01:19.359> a<00:01:19.539> player<00:01:19.840> becomes

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:20.349 
spawners only work when a player becomes

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:26.069 
spawners only work when a player becomes
16<00:01:20.829> blocks<00:01:21.779> in<00:01:22.779> diameter<00:01:23.310> no<00:01:24.310> 16<00:01:24.819> yet<00:01:25.420> has<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.659> 16

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
16 blocks in diameter no 16 yet has a 16

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.830 
16 blocks in diameter no 16 yet has a 16
when<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.259> become<00:01:26.829> in<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.069> 16<00:01:27.459> block<00:01:28.179> radius

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
when you become in a 16 block radius

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.769 
when you become in a 16 block radius
from<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:30.549> basically<00:01:30.700> anyone<00:01:31.209> who<00:01:31.419> comes<00:01:31.569> in

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
a 16 block radius this will activate

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.489 
a 16 block radius this will activate
activate<00:01:33.819> a<00:01:33.849> pressure<00:01:34.240> plate<00:01:34.419> here<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:34.840> this

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
activate a pressure plate here and this

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:36.989 
activate a pressure plate here and this
will<00:01:35.619> activate<00:01:35.829> whatever<00:01:36.219> you<00:01:36.310> want<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.669> just

you<00:01:38.289> can<00:01:38.439> use<00:01:38.469> TNT<00:01:39.069> piston<00:01:39.669> traps<00:01:40.090> whatever

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
you can use TNT piston traps whatever

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.929 
you can use TNT piston traps whatever
you<00:01:40.719> want<00:01:40.959> so<00:01:41.950> guys<00:01:42.189> I'm<00:01:42.459> gonna<00:01:42.579> show<00:01:42.669> you<00:01:42.849> how

so let's start you will need to dig two

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.120 
so let's start you will need to dig two
blocks<00:02:30.890> down<00:02:30.980> two<00:02:31.489> blocks<00:02:31.670> down<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:33.130> replace

this block with your soul block that is
not<00:02:36.050> grass<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:38.660> block<00:02:38.870> will<00:02:39.170> be<00:02:39.200> grass

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
not grass and this block will be grass

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.670 
not grass and this block will be grass
but<00:02:39.830> we<00:02:39.920> won't<00:02:40.099> put<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> grass<00:02:40.489> in<00:02:40.700> yet<00:02:41.680> okay

multiplayer<00:03:53.389> but<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.660> may<00:03:53.810> need<00:03:54.019> silk<00:03:54.350> touch

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
multiplayer but you may need silk touch

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.960 
multiplayer but you may need silk touch
and<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.859> don't<00:03:55.040> have<00:03:55.160> silk<00:03:55.370> touch<00:03:55.519> can<00:03:55.760> be<00:03:55.790> used

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
and I don't have silk touch can be used

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.270
