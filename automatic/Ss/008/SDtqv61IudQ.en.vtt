just hear it find the right now so
that's<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.070> good<00:00:44.250> reason<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.789> another

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that's one good reason to do another

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.270 
that's one good reason to do another
good<00:00:45.239> reason<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:46.070> when<00:00:47.070> you're<00:00:47.190> using

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
good reason is because when you're using

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
good reason is because when you're using
one<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.789> things<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.410> forces<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
one of these things it really forces you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
one of these things it really forces you
to<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.940> pitch<00:00:51.860> accurate<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.489> if

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to get your pitch accurate because if

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
to get your pitch accurate because if
you<00:00:53.760> play<00:00:53.940> wrong<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> sounds<00:00:54.570> terrible<00:00:54.870> if<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you play wrong it sounds terrible if you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.010 
you play wrong it sounds terrible if you
play<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.770> sounds<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.309> beautiful

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
play it right it sounds just beautiful

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.790 
play it right it sounds just beautiful
so<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:59.129> I've<00:00:59.340> recommended<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.420> people

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
so I think I've recommended that people

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.990 
so I think I've recommended that people
doing<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:01.949> starter<00:01:02.309> pate<00:01:02.460> course<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
doing my starter pate course have a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
doing my starter pate course have a
guard<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> very<00:01:03.809> early<00:01:04.140> even<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.680> early<00:01:04.799> as

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
guard is very early even as early as

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.670 
guard is very early even as early as
lesson<00:01:05.489> two<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.400> they<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.580> start<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
lesson two so that they can start to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.249 
lesson two so that they can start to
start<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> sort<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.630> get<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> bit<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> handle

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
start to sort of get a bit of a handle

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
start to sort of get a bit of a handle
on<00:01:16.380> moving<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> slider<00:01:17.700> around<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> getting

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
on moving the slider around and getting

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
on moving the slider around and getting
it<00:01:18.450> accurate<00:01:20.630> maybe<00:01:21.630> less<00:01:21.869> than<00:01:21.960> three<00:01:22.229> anyway

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it accurate maybe less than three anyway

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.760 
it accurate maybe less than three anyway
out<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.250> earlier<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> piece<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:27.770> for

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
out there earlier in the piece and for

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.520 
out there earlier in the piece and for
those<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.490> already<00:01:30.470> sort<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
those of you that have already sort of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.270 
those of you that have already sort of
got<00:01:31.710> those<00:01:31.860> basic<00:01:32.070> skills<00:01:33.259> then<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.290> you'll

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
got those basic skills then you you'll

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.740 
got those basic skills then you you'll
be<00:01:35.400> able<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> maybe<00:01:36.119> learn<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> new<00:01:36.540> piece

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
it you can see it much better I think so

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:47.440

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.570 

okay<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.720> -<00:02:49.110> joy<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.650> was<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.370> said

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.670 
with tongues in any sweet position but
doesn't<00:02:53.490> matter<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:54.360> think<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.530> better

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
doesn't matter I think that it's better

doesn't matter I think that it's better
for<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.190> how<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> slide<00:02:56.970> goes<00:02:57.210> up<00:02:57.360> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
for you to see how the slide goes up and

carefully you can always rewind various

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.890 
carefully you can always rewind various
bits<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.040> failure<00:03:05.460> if<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:06.630> through<00:03:06.840> it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
bits of failure if I get through it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.510 
bits of failure if I get through it
before<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.410> you've<00:03:07.770> got<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.040> down<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.250> we

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
before you you've got it down so we

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.790 
before you you've got it down so we
start<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> fourth<00:03:09.510> fret<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> fourth

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
start on the fourth fret of the fourth

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.320 
start on the fourth fret of the fourth
position<00:03:11.010> there<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.520> between<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.820> two<00:03:12.120> dots

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
position there in between the two dots

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.860 
position there in between the two dots
after<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.600> fifth<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.320> seventh<00:03:17.840> played<00:03:18.840> a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
after the fifth the seventh played a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.270 
after the fifth the seventh played a
couple<00:03:19.080> times<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:22.350> then<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.590> run<00:03:22.770> down<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
couple times and then we run down the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.530 
couple times and then we run down the
scale<00:03:23.580> major<00:03:23.940> scale

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
scale major scale

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.839 
scale major scale
-<00:03:24.690> that's

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:38.599 

and<00:03:30.390> then<00:03:30.510> back<00:03:30.689> to<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> 1<00:03:32.209> 2<00:03:33.209> 3<00:03:34.249> 3<00:03:35.249> 2<00:03:35.969> 2<00:03:37.430> goes<00:03:38.430> to

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
and then back to the 1 2 3 3 2 2 goes to

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.739 
and then back to the 1 2 3 3 2 2 goes to
that<00:03:38.730> again<00:03:39.200> Oh<00:03:40.999> what<00:03:41.999> I<00:03:42.030> would<00:03:42.209> call<00:03:42.389> out<00:03:42.629> as

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:42.749 
that again Oh what I would call out as

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:44.989 
that again Oh what I would call out as
I'm<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.590> not<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.340> fret<00:03:44.579> markers

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:44.999 
I'm going is the not the fret markers

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.869 
I'm going is the not the fret markers
not<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.959> fret<00:03:46.109> positions<00:03:46.639> because<00:03:47.639> I<00:03:47.760> will

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
not to fret positions because I will

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.569 
not to fret positions because I will
confuse<00:03:48.239> me<00:03:48.450> too<00:03:48.629> much<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.900> don't<00:03:49.019> have<00:03:49.200> friends

confuse me too much I don't have friends

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.740 
confuse me too much I don't have friends
you<00:03:50.579> can<00:03:50.700> figure<00:03:50.939> out<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.180> fret<00:03:51.359> positions

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you can figure out the fret positions

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.929 
you can figure out the fret positions
from<00:03:51.900> watching<00:03:52.290> my<00:03:52.409> slide<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:53.579> I'm<00:03:53.670> calling

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
from watching my slide what I'm calling

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.979 
from watching my slide what I'm calling
out<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:55.400> numbers<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.669> notes<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
out is the numbers of the notes in the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:29.290 
out is the numbers of the notes in the
major<00:03:58.200> scale<00:04:00.469> and<00:04:02.510> we'll<00:04:03.510> start<00:04:03.750> here

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.340 

notice<00:04:30.300> how<00:04:30.419> better<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.750> sounds<00:04:30.930> what<00:04:31.229> I've

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
notice how better it sounds what I've

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.340 
notice how better it sounds what I've
got<00:04:31.979> my<00:04:32.100> fingers<00:04:32.490> resting<00:04:32.880> beside<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.080> slide

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
got my fingers resting beside the slide

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.960 
got my fingers resting beside the slide
it<00:04:34.560> behind<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.190> slide<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.550> stop<00:04:35.759> all<00:04:35.850> that

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
it behind the slide to stop all that

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.270 
it behind the slide to stop all that
vibration<00:04:36.479> now<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.560> can't<00:04:37.770> see<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.009> as<00:04:38.130> well

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
vibration now you can't see it as well

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.159 
vibration now you can't see it as well
but<00:04:38.460> that's<00:04:38.729> why<00:04:38.970> I'm<00:04:39.060> doing<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.570> then<00:04:40.139> I

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
but that's why I'm doing that and then I

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.860 
but that's why I'm doing that and then I
think<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.560> was<00:04:40.680> just<00:04:40.830> repeats<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.340> again

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
think it was just repeats that again

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:53.439 
think it was just repeats that again
well<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:42.900> was<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.169> different<00:04:43.530> tag<00:04:43.680> at<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.860> end

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.150 

one<00:04:54.449> one<00:04:54.840> yeah

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
one one yeah

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.310 
one one yeah
now<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.759> next<00:04:57.210> little<00:04:57.570> part<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.930> starts<00:04:58.229> on

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
now the next little part of it starts on

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.490 
now the next little part of it starts on
the<00:04:58.350> two

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:20.230 

so<00:05:06.500> 2<00:05:07.280> 2<00:05:07.880> 3<00:05:08.690> 2<00:05:09.970> 3<00:05:10.970> 4<00:05:11.390> 3<00:05:12.070> 1<00:05:13.180> 2<00:05:14.180> 3<00:05:14.600> 4<00:05:15.290> 3<00:05:15.550> 2<00:05:16.660> y<00:05:18.010> 2<00:05:19.240> 5

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
so 2 2 3 2 3 4 3 1 2 3 4 3 2 y 2 5

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.310 
so 2 2 3 2 3 4 3 1 2 3 4 3 2 y 2 5
that's<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.110> middle<00:05:21.440> strip<00:05:25.930> then<00:05:26.930> we<00:05:26.990> go<00:05:27.110> back

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
that's the middle strip then we go back

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:39.210 
that's the middle strip then we go back
to<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.470> major<00:05:27.680> 3rd

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.390 

1/1

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.730 

okay<00:05:43.400> now<00:05:43.930> just<00:05:44.930> thinking<00:05:45.170> as<00:05:45.260> I'm<00:05:45.380> playing<00:05:45.590> it

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
okay now just thinking as I'm playing it

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.890 
okay now just thinking as I'm playing it
maybe<00:05:45.950> I<00:05:46.040> should<00:05:46.340> do<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.180> again<00:05:47.420> and<00:05:47.540> call<00:05:47.720> out

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
maybe I should do it again and call out

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.600 
maybe I should do it again and call out
the<00:05:47.990> fret<00:05:48.230> markers<00:05:48.650> just<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.040> make<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.340> easier

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
the fret markers just to make it easier

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.730 
the fret markers just to make it easier
for<00:05:49.670> people<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.090> don't<00:05:50.270> have<00:05:50.740> don't

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
for people that don't have don't

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.620 
for people that don't have don't
understand<00:05:52.580> with<00:05:52.730> my<00:05:52.880> Scalf<00:05:53.270> beats<00:05:53.450> and<00:05:53.600> all

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
understand with my Scalf beats and all

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.540 
understand with my Scalf beats and all
that<00:05:53.900> so<00:05:54.230> I'll<00:05:54.590> have<00:05:54.800> a<00:05:54.830> go<00:05:55.010> but<00:05:57.130> then<00:05:58.130> what<00:05:58.310> it

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
that so I'll have a go but then what it

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.250 
that so I'll have a go but then what it
might<00:05:58.730> get<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:58.970> bit<00:05:59.180> crazy<00:05:59.360> let's<00:05:59.780> have<00:05:59.900> a<00:05:59.930> go<00:06:00.080> so

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
might get a bit crazy let's have a go so

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.620 
might get a bit crazy let's have a go so
that's<00:06:00.670> for<00:06:01.670> now<00:06:02.030> that's<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.390> fourth

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
that's for now that's the fourth

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:32.980 
that's for now that's the fourth
position

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:45.170
