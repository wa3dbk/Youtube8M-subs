00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
because the filler is so thin and so

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.740 
because the filler is so thin and so
delicate<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.820> don't<00:02:47.940> want<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> over<00:02:48.270> season<00:02:48.660> it

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
gonna leave that for about five or ten

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.320 
gonna leave that for about five or ten
minutes<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.680> sit<00:02:52.890> not<00:02:53.280> too<00:02:53.459> long<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
salt doesn't pull the moisture out of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.110 
salt doesn't pull the moisture out of
the<00:02:55.920> fish<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:56.580> we're<00:02:56.670> gonna<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.940> the
