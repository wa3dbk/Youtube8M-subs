from the good people over at verbatim

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.690 
from the good people over at verbatim
and<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.230> verbatim<00:00:10.860> quad<00:00:11.130> interface

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
and this is the verbatim quad interface

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.759 
and this is the verbatim quad interface
hard<00:00:11.969> drive<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.410> terabyte

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
hard drive it is the one terabyte

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.400 
hard drive it is the one terabyte
edition<00:00:14.280> which<00:00:14.519> includes<00:00:15.000> e-sata<00:00:15.570> USB

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
edition which includes e-sata USB

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.519 
edition which includes e-sata USB
firewire<00:00:16.680> 400<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> firewire<00:00:18.060> 800<00:00:18.359> which<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
firewire 400 and firewire 800 which is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
firewire 400 and firewire 800 which is
why<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.920> called<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.369> quad<00:00:20.670> interface<00:00:21.210> so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
why it is called the quad interface so

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.310 
why it is called the quad interface so
let's<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.080> started<00:00:22.760> as<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.939> open<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.390> says

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
let's get started as you open it up says

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.849 
let's get started as you open it up says
verbatim<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.869> it<00:00:27.869> looks<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.470> top

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
verbatim and it looks like right on top

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.580 
verbatim and it looks like right on top
we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.400> user<00:00:30.300> manual<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:30.960> probably<00:00:31.320> get

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
we have the user manual and probably get

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
we have the user manual and probably get
its<00:00:31.740> getting<00:00:32.250> started<00:00:32.700> guide<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.270> then

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
its getting started guide in here then

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.010 
its getting started guide in here then
it<00:00:34.290> looks<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.430> top<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it looks like right on top we have the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
it looks like right on top we have the
hard<00:00:37.980> drive<00:00:38.219> itself<00:00:38.550> let's<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.000> pull<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> out

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
hard drive itself let's just pull it out

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.280 
hard drive itself let's just pull it out
and<00:00:40.670> from<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.090> feel<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.780> hard<00:00:43.110> drive

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and from what I can feel this hard drive

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.709 
and from what I can feel this hard drive
feels<00:00:43.649> very<00:00:44.100> heavy<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> actually

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
feels very heavy and if you actually

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
feels very heavy and if you actually
look<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.440> website<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.070> looks<00:00:47.100> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
look at it on the website it looks like

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430 
look at it on the website it looks like
it<00:00:47.640> might<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:47.940> made<00:00:48.300> from<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> cheap<00:00:49.200> plastic

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it might be made from a cheap plastic

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
it might be made from a cheap plastic
but<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.579> actually<00:00:50.820> metal<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> can

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
but this is actually metal and you can

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.139 
but this is actually metal and you can
tell<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.980> metal<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> feels<00:00:53.699> very

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
tell that it's metal it feels very

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.160 
tell that it's metal it feels very
sturdy<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.190> afraid<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.930> just

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
sturdy and I'm not afraid that it's just

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
sturdy and I'm not afraid that it's just
going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> fall<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.789> break<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.449> something<00:01:00.809> on

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to fall or break or something on

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.680 
going to fall or break or something on
this<00:01:01.949> side<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.000> very<00:01:03.329> shiny

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this side you can see it's very shiny

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
this side you can see it's very shiny
you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.379> me<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:05.580> also<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.909> power

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you can see me and there's also a power

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
you can see me and there's also a power
button<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.770> there's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> small

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
button on the side here there's a small

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.719 
button on the side here there's a small
vent<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.729> two

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
vent and on the back we have two

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
vent and on the back we have two
firewire<00:01:12.150> 800<00:01:12.630> ports<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.409> linking<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
firewire 800 ports for linking two of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.539 
firewire 800 ports for linking two of
these<00:01:14.280> together<00:01:14.659> firewire<00:01:15.659> 400<00:01:16.350> port<00:01:16.590> USB<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
these together firewire 400 port USB and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.109 
these together firewire 400 port USB and
esata<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:19.200> power<00:01:19.500> button<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> plug

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
esata the power button and then the plug

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.390 
esata the power button and then the plug
for<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.450> power<00:01:21.689> port<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.950> let's<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.250> what

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
for the power port so let's see what

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.560 
for the power port so let's see what
else<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.570> looks

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
else is in here so here we have looks

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.020 
else is in here so here we have looks
like<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:30.930> include<00:01:31.439> an<00:01:31.590> eSATA<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.790> will

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
like they include an eSATA which I will

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
like they include an eSATA which I will
not<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.329> using<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:34.320> computer<00:01:34.500> does

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
not be using because my computer does

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.370 
not be using because my computer does
not<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.369> SATA<00:01:36.020> they<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:38.570> firewire<00:01:39.570> 400

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
not have a SATA they have a firewire 400

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.910 
not have a SATA they have a firewire 400
to<00:01:40.530> firewire<00:01:41.040> 400<00:01:41.670> cable<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.860> USB<00:01:43.860> cable<00:01:45.920> looks

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
to firewire 400 cable a USB cable looks

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
to firewire 400 cable a USB cable looks
like<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> firewire<00:01:48.060> 800<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> firewire<00:01:49.710> 800

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like a firewire 800 to a firewire 800

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:59.959 
like a firewire 800 to a firewire 800
cable<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:56.030> firewire<00:01:57.030> 800<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.829> believe<00:01:59.820> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
cable a firewire 800 to I believe it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.970 
cable a firewire 800 to I believe it's
6-pin<00:02:00.570> firewire

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the power cord itself that also comes

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.780 
the power cord itself that also comes
with<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:07.000> nice<00:02:07.240> little<00:02:07.480> stand<00:02:07.870> which<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:09.550> not

with a nice little stand which it's not

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.640 
with a nice little stand which it's not
very<00:02:10.060> heavy<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.630> feels<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.170> might<00:02:11.200> be

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
very heavy it feels like it might be

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.190 
very heavy it feels like it might be
made<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.520> probably<00:02:12.910> made<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.570> plastic<00:02:14.020> but

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
made it's probably made of plastic but
