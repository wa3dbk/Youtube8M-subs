and WiiU people are been more skeptical

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.850 
and WiiU people are been more skeptical
and<00:00:44.640> rightly<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.170> leaker<00:00:46.559> might

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and rightly so because this leaker might

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
and rightly so because this leaker might
have<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.100> its<00:00:47.250> idea<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> Rayman<00:00:48.420> league

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
have got its idea from the Rayman league

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
have got its idea from the Rayman league
here<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> believe

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
here so I don't know what to believe

after I watched the gif several times I
started<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.010> looks<00:00:53.219> big<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
started to think it looks big because it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.400 
started to think it looks big because it
looked<00:00:54.149> too<00:00:54.329> simple<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> lot

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
because I haven't played sunshine I did
have<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> idea<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.170> 3d<00:01:37.500> remake<00:01:37.740> could

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
have the idea that this 3d remake could

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
have the idea that this 3d remake could
be<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> new<00:01:38.670> 3ds<00:01:39.060> exclusive<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> saw

released in North America it could be

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.770 
released in North America it could be
that<00:02:40.640> they<00:02:40.790> were<00:02:40.850> thinking<00:02:41.180> about<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.480> at<00:02:41.600> one

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
that they were thinking about it at one

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.479 
that they were thinking about it at one
point<00:02:41.989> but<00:02:42.260> eventually<00:02:42.709> decided<00:02:43.040> against<00:02:43.370> it

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
point but eventually decided against it

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
only problem is I don't see why Nintendo

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.360 
only problem is I don't see why Nintendo
would<00:02:51.110> find<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.410> be<00:02:51.530> effective<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.160> release
