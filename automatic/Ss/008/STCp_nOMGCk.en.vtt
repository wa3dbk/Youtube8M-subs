 passengers who 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.309
 it comes from the United States at a high price in the United States so if it leads to 3 

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:00.030
 million 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.870

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.220
 sanef passengers that is expensive 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.210
 it scares me 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.530
 the phenomenon of Canadians flying to the other side of the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.770
 border and captures the leaders of montreal airports 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.230
 but what worries them even more is the competition that the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.499
 US and Canadian airports unfair competition according to m 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.140
 the law would pass for example pay no taxes 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.950

 the cedh gave life to parents as theme is there to give this 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.970

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.310
 while his death happened in europe with the debts of this tax by 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.139
 passenger only municipal taxes 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.749
 montreal airports pay close to $ 40 million each year 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.209
 not to mention its annual rent to transport canada of more than 20 million 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.409
 amount that may double by 2014 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.679
 simple trick control 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.679
 wanting to be the moors of many isolated experiences 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.369
 as if it was not enough 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:59.299
 airport improvement fees will be increased for 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.219
 passengers departing from montreal airport trudeau next month and 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.359

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:12.149
 could be added there is a need to improve services in europe a monk 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.269

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.329
 parking are very high 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.559
 the carriers were also involved with responsibilities need to be more 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.829
 effective could face this competition 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.740
 18% of the Canadian population 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.980
 cross the border to fly, this is what a study reveals 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.729
 of the canada hotel association 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.729

 berruien did not convince hardly distances with respect to the other vachon 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.279
 among young people today we see his expectations in my opinion while the fed 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:56.989
 will have power and even winnipeg or npa lo thought again opted for 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.379
 the way a tree lobby look for Winnipeg passengers the 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.609
 leaders of Canadian airports both men the government help

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.159
 to compete with the Americans as equals 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.099
 remains to be known if Canadian travelers to take advantage of discounts 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.869
