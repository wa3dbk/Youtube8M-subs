00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.310
 what happens ok thinks with 685 million 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.350
 of dollars how many flip flops can 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.580
 buy I know reasons flip flops and 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.940
 reasoning in flip flops I did 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.190
 a question i thought but it's not that for 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.680
 to make a prize pool of 685 million 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.820
 dollars need a lot of people 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.740
 so it means that he played a lot 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.050
 people to this lottery and a half to that 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970
 it's not like there is anyone from 99 per 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.710
 one hundred of the world population that us 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.390
 we defend in the streets against it 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.700
 exploitation by one percent 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.920
 of the rich that becomes ever richer 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.250
 at the expense of 99 percent let me understand 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.010
 then neither outrage and envy 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.090
 everything is based 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 mean what a pity it is a shame then everything 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.819
 this system shows that everything is 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.739
 past only envy and selfishness 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.680
 greed then because each time one 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.299
 vince wants to remain anonymous not because 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.090
 one says he doesn't want to let anyone know 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:02.430
 to relatives therefore also at home separately 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.430
 some sudden burst of joy 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.150
 that you have uncle nothing because in your head he knows 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.870
 who thinks of a gentleman says I do n't give you a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:19.799
