00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.279
 for the realization of the chopsticks we go 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.550
 already finish well at the labor camp 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.550
 is there 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:39.570
 a little bit not one on the dough that has 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:49.769
 welcome we will go down the fat one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:01:06.149
 poles apart to pour it on 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:01:08.600
 the contract but we provide them very 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.600
 slightly 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.310
 and here we will be able to develop four 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.310
 paws on 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:52.869
 to be sure my chopsticks are from 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:56.190
 same frozen size weigh they make 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.190
 all about 300 g 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.970
 here 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.550
 so how am I going to be able to move on to 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.290
 face tumbling so for that I use a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.180
 secret release of the mark 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.390
 scrapbooking which is partner of 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.390
 dawn 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:32.660
 it's still more practical than that 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:44.989
 do not put your finger and I'll hold you 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:48.940
 the surplus with an art ya 200 years ago we're going 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.940
 prepare the work plan 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.230
 we will take a money we will clear 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:08.720
 with the palm of the hand 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:15.049
 typing hard enough but not too much no 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.440
 more and then I was rolled without much 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.440
 greenhouse 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.090
 here and we will form the key the little 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.890
 welding with the roofs we think 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:38.520
 bewilderment here finally a little bit 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:44.340
 hands we will try from the 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:47.000
 center and we're going to get bigger by going 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.000
 to the ends 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.520
