tight<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> beginning<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.460> know

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
tight in the beginning but then you know

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.219 
tight in the beginning but then you know
we<00:01:02.760> waited<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> came<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:03.960> bit

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
we waited it came around a little bit

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
we waited it came around a little bit
better<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> long<00:01:05.339> peel<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> long<00:01:06.119> runs

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
better but as a long peel on long runs

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.460 
better but as a long peel on long runs
they<00:01:06.540> actually<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> race<00:01:07.049> probably<00:01:07.350> played

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
they actually the race probably played

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.780 
they actually the race probably played
good<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.950> us<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.580> didn't

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
good for us because it really didn't

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.539 
good for us because it really didn't
have<00:01:08.880> any<00:01:09.090> long<00:01:09.330> green<00:01:09.810> flag<00:01:09.840> runs<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
have any long green flag runs and you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.560 
have any long green flag runs and you
know<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.939> would<00:01:11.970> start<00:01:12.240> getting<00:01:12.330> tired

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
know then it would start getting tired

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
know then it would start getting tired
of<00:01:12.750> coffee<00:01:12.990> lawn<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> be<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.770> again<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
of coffee lawn and be good again so and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.070 
of coffee lawn and be good again so and
then<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.430> elected<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.970> adjust<00:01:18.689> on

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
then you know we elected to adjust on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.660 
then you know we elected to adjust on
its<00:01:19.320> even<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.860> something<00:01:20.130> right<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
its even get something right which is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.070 
its even get something right which is
almost<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.180> did<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.450> Thompson<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
almost like we did at Thompson that one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.450 
almost like we did at Thompson that one
time<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.560> adjust<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> car

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
time you know adjust to make the car

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.969 
time you know adjust to make the car
right<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.700> bad<00:01:24.030> tires<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.680> our<00:01:25.799> good

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
right on bad tires and then put our good

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
right on bad tires and then put our good
stuff<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.540> did<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.170> I
