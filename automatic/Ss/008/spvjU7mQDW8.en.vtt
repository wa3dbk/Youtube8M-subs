hey guys one of the questions that I

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.890 
hey guys one of the questions that I
frequently<00:00:06.899> get<00:00:07.049> asked<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.589> can<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.700> mix<00:00:08.940> post

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
frequently get asked is can you mix post

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.299 
frequently get asked is can you mix post
jam<00:00:10.200> dextrose<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:11.429> post<00:00:12.179> Jim<00:00:12.540> active-matrix

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
jam dextrose with post Jim active-matrix

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.050 
jam dextrose with post Jim active-matrix
and<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.969> obvious<00:00:15.389> question<00:00:15.480> well<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.910> not

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
and the obvious question well it's not

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
and the obvious question well it's not
that<00:00:18.270> obvious<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:18.960> getting<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.320> question

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
that obvious if I'm getting the question

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.849 
that obvious if I'm getting the question
is<00:00:20.670> yes<00:00:21.029> absolutely<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.869> fact<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.320> designed

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
is yes absolutely in fact it's designed

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.330 
is yes absolutely in fact it's designed
they're<00:00:23.550> designed<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.570> work<00:00:24.830> together<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
they're designed to work together and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.950 
they're designed to work together and
not<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.730> work<00:00:27.119> together<00:00:27.330> but<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> be

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
not just work together but to be

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310 
not just work together but to be
consumed<00:00:28.609> together<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:30.269> why<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> flavors

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
consumed together that's why the flavors

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.490 
consumed together that's why the flavors
come<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.980> similar<00:00:32.520> flavors<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.540> two

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
come in similar flavors there's two

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
come in similar flavors there's two
different<00:00:34.649> flavors<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.250> post<00:00:35.760> Jim<00:00:36.030> both<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
different flavors of post Jim both the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
different flavors of post Jim both the
active<00:00:36.780> matrix<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> dextrose<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
active matrix and the dextrose and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.200 
active matrix and the dextrose and
that's<00:00:38.969> fruit<00:00:39.239> punch<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.879> watermelon<00:00:41.879> when

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that's fruit punch and watermelon when

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
that's fruit punch and watermelon when
you<00:00:42.360> add<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> dextrose<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.340> active

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you add the dextrose to the active

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.660 
you add the dextrose to the active
matrix<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.930> only<00:00:46.230> does<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.500> enhance<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
matrix not only does it enhance the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.330 
matrix not only does it enhance the
flavor<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.800> post<00:00:50.809> Jim<00:00:51.809> active<00:00:52.340> matrix

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
flavor of that post Jim active matrix

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.990 
flavor of that post Jim active matrix
product<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.690> also<00:00:54.840> enhances<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.000> uptake

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
product but it also enhances the uptake

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.930 
product but it also enhances the uptake
in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.739> utilization<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.340> nutrients<00:00:59.850> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in the utilization of the nutrients that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.429 
in the utilization of the nutrients that
you're<00:01:00.239> getting<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.219> post<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.910> two

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
you're getting and post you now two

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.460 
you're getting and post you now two
ingredients<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.530> particular<00:01:05.189> creative<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
ingredients in particular creative and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.370 
ingredients in particular creative and
carnitine<00:01:07.470> research<00:01:08.400> shows<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.960> need

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
carnitine research shows that you need

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
carnitine research shows that you need
to<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.090> fast<00:01:13.020> digesting<00:01:13.320> carb<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
to have a fast digesting carb and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
to have a fast digesting carb and
dextrose<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:17.119> fastest<00:01:18.119> digesting

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
dextrose is one of the fastest digesting

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.289 
dextrose is one of the fastest digesting
carbs<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.100> consume<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.030> need

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
carbs that you can consume but you need

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.429 
carbs that you can consume but you need
a<00:01:21.600> fast<00:01:22.350> digesting<00:01:22.590> carb<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:24.780> create<00:01:25.259> an

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
a fast digesting carb to create an

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.630 
a fast digesting carb to create an
insulin<00:01:25.890> spike<00:01:26.960> which<00:01:28.040> enhances<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> uptake

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
insulin spike which enhances the uptake

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.840 
insulin spike which enhances the uptake
of<00:01:29.880> those<00:01:30.270> nutrients<00:01:30.869> into<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:32.130> muscle

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
of those nutrients into the muscle

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.620 
of those nutrients into the muscle
fibers<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.189> said<00:01:35.840> taking<00:01:36.840> post<00:01:37.470> gym

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
fibers so like I said taking post gym

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.140 
fibers so like I said taking post gym
dextrose<00:01:39.630> mix<00:01:40.350> together<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> same<00:01:41.820> time

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
dextrose mix together at the same time

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
dextrose mix together at the same time
with<00:01:42.450> your<00:01:42.570> active<00:01:42.960> matrix<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.520> actually<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
with your active matrix is actually the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.380 
with your active matrix is actually the
best<00:01:45.600> way<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.439> consume<00:01:46.979> both<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:48.149> those

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
best way to consume both of those

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.410 
best way to consume both of those
products<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> enhances<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
products because that it enhances the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.260 
products because that it enhances the
flavor<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.930> enhanced<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> said<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
flavor is enhanced and like I said the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.319 
flavor is enhanced and like I said the
absorption<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.799> uptake<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.850> utilization

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
absorption and the uptake in utilization

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.080 
absorption and the uptake in utilization
of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> nutrients<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> post<00:01:59.640> tramatic

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
of the nutrients in the post tramatic

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
of the nutrients in the post tramatic
matrix<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:02.090> enhanced<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.509> why<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> designed

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
matrix is enhanced that's why I designed

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.210 
matrix is enhanced that's why I designed
all<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.210> gym<00:02:06.450> products<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.799> work<00:02:07.950> together

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
all the gym products to work together

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.170 
all the gym products to work together
just<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.720> bottom<00:02:10.200> line<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.410> yes<00:02:11.180> yes

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
just like that so bottom line is yes yes

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.600 
just like that so bottom line is yes yes
not<00:02:12.510> only<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
not only can you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.920 
not only can you
you<00:02:14.000> should<00:02:14.480> mix<00:02:15.470> your<00:02:16.100> Postum<00:02:16.670> dextrose<00:02:17.210> with

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
you should mix your Postum dextrose with

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.650 
you should mix your Postum dextrose with
your<00:02:18.170> post<00:02:18.470> gym<00:02:18.740> active-matrix<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.150> same
