00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.540 
of a lever body you want to avoid
placing<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.340> handlebar<00:02:04.790> tape<00:02:05.030> over<00:02:06.550> believer

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.359 
placing the handlebar tape over believer
housing<00:02:08.290> by<00:02:09.290> doing<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.740> this<00:02:09.920> creates<00:02:10.280> an

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
housing by doing so this creates an

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.130 
housing by doing so this creates an
unsightly<00:02:10.700> bulge<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.420> can<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:11.690> quite

is<00:02:39.080> quite<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> key<00:02:39.560> area<00:02:39.770> as<00:02:40.010> we<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.400> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
is quite a key area as we get to the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.750 
is quite a key area as we get to the
lever<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.720> avoid<00:02:42.020> any<00:02:42.320> unsightly<00:02:42.739> bulges<00:02:43.370> we

lever to avoid any unsightly bulges we

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.729 
lever to avoid any unsightly bulges we
try<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> avoid<00:02:44.360> doing<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.750> figure<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:45.080> 8<00:02:45.320> round

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
try to avoid doing a figure of 8 round

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.160 
try to avoid doing a figure of 8 round
and<00:02:46.070> round<00:02:46.310> believer<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:47.480> simply<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.020> want

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
and round believer we simply just want

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.320 
and round believer we simply just want
to<00:02:48.230> cover<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.620> handlebar<00:02:49.190> tape<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.060> we<00:02:50.150> go

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
to cover the handlebar tape so we go

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.830 
to cover the handlebar tape so we go
round<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.530> bottom<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> lever<00:02:52.720> come<00:02:53.720> around

the back of the handlebar and up and
over<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.380> lever<00:02:58.540> then<00:02:59.540> we'll<00:02:59.690> continue

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
over the lever then we'll continue

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.630 
over the lever then we'll continue
wrapping<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.050> same<00:03:03.320> spiral<00:03:04.160> pattern

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
wrapping and the same spiral pattern

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
wrapping and the same spiral pattern
keeping<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.450> even<00:03:05.750> overlap<00:03:06.019> as<00:03:06.350> we<00:03:06.739> go<00:03:06.860> up

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
keeping it even overlap as we go up

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.570 
keeping it even overlap as we go up
towards<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.400> step<00:03:07.870> top<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.080> bar<00:03:09.290> again<00:03:10.100> just

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
towards a step top of the bar again just

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.140 
towards a step top of the bar again just
continuing<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.030> same<00:03:12.250> spiral<00:03:13.250> pattern<00:03:16.150> plug

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
continuing the same spiral pattern plug

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.990 
continuing the same spiral pattern plug
in<00:03:17.300> all<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.690> a<00:03:17.750> handlebar<00:03:18.940> keeping<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
in all of a handlebar keeping the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.940 
in all of a handlebar keeping the
handlebar<00:03:20.330> fairly<00:03:20.690> nice<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.080> taut<00:03:21.260> all<00:03:21.709> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
handlebar fairly nice and taut all the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.259 
handlebar fairly nice and taut all the
way<00:03:22.100> as<00:03:22.250> we<00:03:22.400> go

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:42.430 

trying<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.390> make<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.900> as<00:03:29.989> tidy<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:30.530> possible

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.230 

now<00:03:42.950> generally<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> lot<00:03:43.490> of<00:03:43.580> bar-type<00:03:43.970> you'll

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
now generally a lot of bar-type you'll

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.690 
now generally a lot of bar-type you'll
get<00:03:44.450> an<00:03:44.540> excess<00:03:44.930> amount<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:46.070> tight<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:46.490> there's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
get an excess amount of tight so there's

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.130 
get an excess amount of tight so there's
more<00:03:46.910> tighten<00:03:47.360> you'll<00:03:47.480> actually<00:03:47.660> require

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
more tighten you'll actually require

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.930 
more tighten you'll actually require
which<00:03:48.740> means<00:03:48.980> we're<00:03:49.190> going<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.490> have<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.730> trim

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
which means we're going to have to trim

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.900 
which means we're going to have to trim
down<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.240> excess<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.920> little<00:03:52.160> tip<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.730> to

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
down the excess and little tip is to

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.480 
down the excess and little tip is to
actually<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.270> score<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.020> lightly<00:03:54.460> with<00:03:55.460> your

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
actually just score it lightly with your

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.390 
actually just score it lightly with your
scissors<00:03:55.970> as<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:57.020> guide<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.770> then<00:04:00.830> we'll<00:04:01.070> cut

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
scissors as a guide and then we'll cut

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:15.060 
scissors as a guide and then we'll cut
that<00:04:01.550> score<00:04:01.910> mark

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.750 

once<00:04:16.070> that's<00:04:16.250> been<00:04:16.310> trimmed<00:04:19.510> rap<00:04:20.510> background

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
once that's been trimmed rap background

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.430 
once that's been trimmed rap background
by<00:04:22.760> cutting<00:04:23.150> at<00:04:23.270> an<00:04:23.360> angle<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:24.080> means<00:04:24.290> we<00:04:24.410> have

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
by cutting at an angle it means we have

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.800 
by cutting at an angle it means we have
a<00:04:24.560> nice<00:04:24.920> straight<00:04:25.370> edge<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.540> end<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:26.750> our

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
a nice straight edge to the end of our

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.590 
a nice straight edge to the end of our
bar<00:04:27.080> tape<00:04:27.460> find<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.550> part<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.060> keep<00:04:29.180> all<00:04:29.420> in

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
bar tape find the part is to keep all in

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.050 
bar tape find the part is to keep all in
place<00:04:30.670> we<00:04:31.670> use<00:04:31.850> tape<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:34.670> secure<00:04:34.820> the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
place we use tape to secure the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.260 
place we use tape to secure the

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
handlebar tape to the bar and stop it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.940 
handlebar tape to the bar and stop it
from<00:04:38.360> unraveling<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:40.640> only<00:04:40.790> need<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.120> wrap

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
from unraveling we only need to wrap

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.370 
from unraveling we only need to wrap
tape<00:04:42.950> around<00:04:42.980> here<00:04:43.610> two<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.570> three<00:04:44.840> times<00:04:45.080> you
