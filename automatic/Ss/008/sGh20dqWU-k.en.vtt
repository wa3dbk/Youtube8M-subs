00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it to just automatically shut off I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.640 
it to just automatically shut off I
would<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.239> for<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.080> kind<00:02:21.530> of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
would like you know for it to kind of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.949 
would like you know for it to kind of
give<00:02:22.250> me<00:02:22.400> an<00:02:22.520> opportunity<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.540> case<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
give me an opportunity in case the

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.280 
give me an opportunity in case the
battery<00:02:24.319> runs<00:02:24.500> down<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.770> try<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.280> land<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:26.290> I

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
battery runs down to try and land it I

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.850 
battery runs down to try and land it I
did<00:02:28.069> keep<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.520> at<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> middle<00:02:29.360> voltage<00:02:30.290> cutoff

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
did keep it at a middle voltage cutoff

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.940 
did keep it at a middle voltage cutoff
so<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.870> battery<00:02:33.200> did<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.470> run<00:02:33.620> down<00:02:33.769> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so that the battery did it run down to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.390 
so that the battery did it run down to
low<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.370> don't<00:02:34.519> kill<00:02:34.700> my<00:02:34.850> batteries<00:02:36.400> start

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
low so I don't kill my batteries start

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.130 
low so I don't kill my batteries start
moving<00:02:37.670> normal<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.360> do<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> soft<00:02:39.010> start

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
moving normal you can do a soft start

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.220 
moving normal you can do a soft start
but<00:02:42.140> when<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.440> do<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:44.120> tends<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.540> be<00:02:44.750> really

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
but when you do it it tends to be really

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.710 
but when you do it it tends to be really
I<00:02:46.630> personally<00:02:47.630> like<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:48.230> respite<00:02:49.720> when

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
I personally like to have respite when

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.539 
I personally like to have respite when
you<00:02:50.900> throttle<00:02:51.530> up<00:02:51.650> that's<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.130> that's<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
you throttle up that's the that's the

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.809 
you throttle up that's the that's the
response<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.390> have<00:02:53.600> with<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.500> motor

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
response that you have with the motor

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.270 
response that you have with the motor
whereas<00:02:55.819> if<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.569> soft<00:02:56.930> start<00:02:57.319> it'll

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
whereas if you do a soft start it'll

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.880 
whereas if you do a soft start it'll
every<00:02:59.060> time<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.420> throttle<00:03:00.170> up<00:03:00.290> or<00:03:00.440> down

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
every time you throttle up or down

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.220 
every time you throttle up or down
the<00:03:00.980> response<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> motor<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.299> extremely

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
the response on the motor is extremely

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.190 
the response on the motor is extremely
it's<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.220> lot<00:03:04.400> slower<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.569> didn't<00:03:06.080> really

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
it's a lot slower and I didn't really

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.949 
it's a lot slower and I didn't really
like<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.739> kept<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.280> normal<00:03:07.959> you

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
like that so I kept it to normal you

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.550 
like that so I kept it to normal you
could<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.260> soft<00:03:09.590> very<00:03:10.549> soft<00:03:10.910> or<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:12.440> know

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
could do soft very soft or you know

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.460 
could do soft very soft or you know
normal<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.310> keep<00:03:13.489> it<00:03:13.609> at<00:03:13.730> normal<00:03:14.470> with

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
normal so I just keep it at normal with

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.340 
normal so I just keep it at normal with
the<00:03:15.590> timing<00:03:16.010> mode<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.910> default<00:03:17.750> timing<00:03:18.170> mode

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
the timing mode the default timing mode

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.400 
the timing mode the default timing mode
is<00:03:18.590> five<00:03:19.060> which<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.329> believe<00:03:20.600> 15<00:03:21.049> degrees

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
is five which is I believe 15 degrees

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.949 
is five which is I believe 15 degrees
which<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.070> middle<00:03:22.400> timing<00:03:22.910> mode<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.750> can

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
which is the middle timing mode you can

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.789 
which is the middle timing mode you can
have<00:03:24.140> low<00:03:24.410> middle<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.549> high<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:27.140> these<00:03:27.320> RC

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
have low middle and high with these RC

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.240 
have low middle and high with these RC
Lander<00:03:28.359> units<00:03:29.359> they<00:03:30.260> recommend<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.070> put

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
Lander units they recommend that you put

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.789 
Lander units they recommend that you put
it<00:03:31.400> up<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.700> high<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.709> high<00:03:33.890> timing<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:34.970> I'm<00:03:35.799> the

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
it up to high the high timing so I'm the

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.580 
it up to high the high timing so I'm the
highest<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.250> can<00:03:37.280> go<00:03:37.549> on<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.880> eight

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
highest you can go on this is eight

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.080 
highest you can go on this is eight
which<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:39.859> think<00:03:39.890> like<00:03:40.070> 22<00:03:40.670> something

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
which is I think like 22 something

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.050 
which is I think like 22 something
degrees<00:03:41.269> or<00:03:41.810> whatever<00:03:42.040> but<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.100> decided<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.730> go

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
degrees or whatever but I decided to go

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.740 
degrees or whatever but I decided to go
in<00:03:44.299> between<00:03:45.579> what<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.609> thought<00:03:46.910> was<00:03:47.150> high<00:03:47.329> so<00:03:47.720> I

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
in between what I thought was high so I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.170 
in between what I thought was high so I
be<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:49.040> did<00:03:49.760> 7<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:50.930> case<00:03:51.970> 7<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.090> still

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
be I did 7 so just in case 7 is still

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.569 
be I did 7 so just in case 7 is still
pretty<00:03:53.480> high<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.720> think<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.470> yet<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.430> won't

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
pretty high I think and yet you won't

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.099 
pretty high I think and yet you won't
kill<00:03:56.030> your<00:03:56.239> batteries<00:03:56.720> either<00:03:58.959> governor<00:03:59.959> mode

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
kill your batteries either governor mode

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.150 
kill your batteries either governor mode

were<00:04:41.700> all<00:04:41.910> able<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:43.010> be<00:04:44.010> powered<00:04:44.430> by<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.790> ESC<00:04:45.510> S

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
were all able to be powered by the ESC S

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.920 
were all able to be powered by the ESC S
which<00:04:46.080> will<00:04:46.320> be<00:04:46.470> easy<00:04:47.000> so<00:04:48.000> keep<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.840> way

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
which will be easy so keep that the way

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.040 
which will be easy so keep that the way
it<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.970> lipo<00:04:50.970> sells<00:04:51.240> we're<00:04:51.510> gonna<00:04:51.600> be<00:04:51.780> running

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
it is lipo sells we're gonna be running

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.050 
it is lipo sells we're gonna be running
out<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.260> four<00:04:52.530> cells<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.130> we'll<00:04:53.820> keep<00:04:54.000> that

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
out of four cells so we'll keep that

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.610 
out of four cells so we'll keep that
there<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.740> way<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:58.290> that's<00:04:58.440> pretty

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
there the way it is and that's pretty

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.430 
there the way it is and that's pretty
much<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.310> then<00:04:59.540> just<00:05:00.540> press<00:05:00.750> ok<00:05:01.200> when

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
much it and then just press ok when

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.070 
much it and then just press ok when
everything<00:05:01.890> is<00:05:02.010> set<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.669> saves<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.450> then

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
everything is set and it saves and then

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.490 
everything is set and it saves and then
it<00:05:04.500> can<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.970> go<00:05:06.090> back<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.540> press<00:05:06.780> our<00:05:06.990> peers

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
it can go to go back to press our peers

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.950 
it can go to go back to press our peers
over<00:05:07.770> there<00:05:08.720> or<00:05:10.550> any<00:05:11.550> way<00:05:11.700> but<00:05:12.090> once<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.690> saves

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
over there or any way but once it saves

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.810 
over there or any way but once it saves
that's<00:05:13.680> pretty<00:05:14.010> much<00:05:16.010> once<00:05:17.010> it<00:05:17.190> saves<00:05:17.520> like

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
that's pretty much once it saves like

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.930 
that's pretty much once it saves like
that<00:05:18.000> once<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.360> says<00:05:18.570> save<00:05:19.110> data<00:05:19.470> okay<00:05:20.010> that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
that once it says save data okay that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.940 
that once it says save data okay that
means<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.300> everything<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.290> your<00:05:22.380> ATC<00:05:22.830> is

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
means that everything in your ATC is

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.830 
means that everything in your ATC is
programmed<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.729> that's<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.479> way<00:05:24.600> it<00:05:24.750> should

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
programmed and that's the way it should

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.570 
programmed and that's the way it should
perform<00:05:25.560> when<00:05:26.100> you're<00:05:26.930> when<00:05:27.930> you're<00:05:28.580> out

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
perform when you're when you're out

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.680 
perform when you're when you're out
there<00:05:29.940> on<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.240> field<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:32.000> that's<00:05:33.000> how<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.270> put

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
there on the field so that's how you put

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.940 
there on the field so that's how you put
that<00:05:33.930> is<00:05:34.110> how<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.260> use<00:05:34.530> my<00:05:34.560> turnigy<00:05:35.490> program<00:05:35.940> box

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
that is how I use my turnigy program box

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.250 
that is how I use my turnigy program box
I'm<00:05:37.950> sure<00:05:38.250> it's<00:05:38.490> got<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.669> lot<00:05:38.940> more<00:05:38.970> functions<00:05:39.540> I

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
I'm sure it's got a lot more functions I

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.210 
I'm sure it's got a lot more functions I
haven't<00:05:41.220> really<00:05:41.729> explored<00:05:42.560> all<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.800> them<00:05:43.919> I've

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
haven't really explored all of them I've

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.770 
haven't really explored all of them I've
just<00:05:44.550> been<00:05:44.700> using<00:05:44.940> you<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.270> use<00:05:45.330> this<00:05:45.600> to

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
just been using you can use this to

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.520 
just been using you can use this to
program<00:05:46.200> not<00:05:47.040> just<00:05:47.310> this<00:05:47.490> kforce<00:05:48.240> ESC<00:05:48.750> for

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
program not just this kforce ESC for

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.920 
program not just this kforce ESC for
flying<00:05:49.890> but<00:05:50.040> also<00:05:50.400> for<00:05:52.070> cars<00:05:53.070> for<00:05:53.640> boats<00:05:54.210> stuff

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
flying but also for cars for boats stuff

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.980 
flying but also for cars for boats stuff
like<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:55.550> really<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:57.090> really<00:05:57.630> good<00:05:57.810> tool

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
like that so really a really good tool

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.560 
like that so really a really good tool
to<00:05:58.050> use<00:05:58.229> if<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:58.860> have<00:05:58.890> the<00:05:59.340> teaser<00:05:59.610> using<00:06:00.390> one

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
to use if you have the teaser using one

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.969 
to use if you have the teaser using one
of<00:06:00.600> these<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.840> 100<00:06:01.620> amp<00:06:01.740> kforce<00:06:02.840> es<00:06:03.840> es<00:06:04.140> so<00:06:04.500> just

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
of these a 100 amp kforce es es so just

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.870 
of these a 100 amp kforce es es so just
keep<00:06:05.160> that<00:06:05.190> in<00:06:05.340> mind<00:06:05.870> alright
