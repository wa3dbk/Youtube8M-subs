I'm saying that they got in a scuffle

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
I'm saying that they got in a scuffle
with<00:01:07.650> her<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.520> hogwash<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.330> believe

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
with her that's hogwash I don't believe

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.500 
with her that's hogwash I don't believe
that<00:01:10.040> yes<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.760> sure<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.150> saw<00:01:12.330> all

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that yes I'm pretty sure they saw all

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600 
that yes I'm pretty sure they saw all
the<00:01:12.690> toys<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.230> and<00:01:13.470> everything<00:01:13.860> else<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the toys out and everything else you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
the toys out and everything else you
know<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:14.940> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:15.780> having<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
know but I think that I'm having the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340 
know but I think that I'm having the
cameras<00:01:16.890> around<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> escalated<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
cameras around it kind of escalated a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
cameras around it kind of escalated a
little<00:01:19.380> bit<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.920> than<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> should

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
little bit more than it should

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.810 
little bit more than it should
I<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> killing<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> Ayana

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
I think the killing of Ayana

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
I think the killing of Ayana
was<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.630> unnecessary<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.920> uncalled<00:01:26.490> for

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
was very unnecessary it was uncalled for

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.530 
was very unnecessary it was uncalled for
and<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:28.140> fact<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.220> may<00:01:29.550> feel<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.910> it's<00:01:30.240> even

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and in fact I may feel that it's even

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.310 
and in fact I may feel that it's even
been<00:01:30.690> delivered<00:01:31.970> from<00:01:32.970> from<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> situation

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
been delivered from from the situation

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
been delivered from from the situation
that<00:01:34.470> I've<00:01:34.590> been<00:01:34.770> hearing<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> made<00:01:36.420> no

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that I've been hearing it was it made no

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
that I've been hearing it was it made no
sense<00:01:36.660> at<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.050> they<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.410> no<00:01:37.530> reason<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.830> go

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
sense at all they had no reason to go

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.109 
sense at all they had no reason to go
into<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.250> house<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.000> had
