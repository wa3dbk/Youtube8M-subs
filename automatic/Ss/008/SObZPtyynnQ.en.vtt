00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and up there which is what the count so

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.710

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.609 

yeah<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.149> plan<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.390> basically<00:01:24.200> we've<00:01:24.590> got

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
yeah so the plan is basically we've got

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.050 
yeah so the plan is basically we've got
our<00:01:24.950> button<00:01:25.250> there<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:25.759> like<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.030> first

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
our button there so it's like the first

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.959 
our button there so it's like the first
one<00:01:26.479> except<00:01:27.170> instead<00:01:27.469> of<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.799> explosion<00:01:28.490> what

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
one except instead of the explosion what

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:56.740 
one except instead of the explosion what
we've<00:01:29.119> got<00:01:29.329> is<00:01:51.909> yes<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:54.429> never<00:01:55.429> gets<00:01:55.610> old<00:01:55.789> though

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
we've got is yes I never gets old though

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.779 
we've got is yes I never gets old though
it's<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.380> bit<00:01:57.530> too<00:01:57.709> far<00:01:57.950> into<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.310> morning<00:01:58.640> now

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
it's a bit too far into the morning now

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.419
