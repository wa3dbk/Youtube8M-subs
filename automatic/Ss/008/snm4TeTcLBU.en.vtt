a Malik and I'm going to be doing a

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.320 
a Malik and I'm going to be doing a
review<00:00:07.730> of<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:08.480> cracked<00:00:08.870> skull<00:00:09.230> scimitar<00:00:10.330> so

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
review of the cracked skull scimitar so

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.859 
review of the cracked skull scimitar so
I've<00:00:11.540> got<00:00:11.750> the<00:00:11.780> 42<00:00:12.440> inch<00:00:12.670> scimitar<00:00:13.670> comes<00:00:14.570> in<00:00:14.840> a

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
I've got the 42 inch scimitar comes in a

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.109 
I've got the 42 inch scimitar comes in a
bunch<00:00:15.110> of<00:00:15.289> different<00:00:15.379> options<00:00:15.949> but<00:00:16.219> um<00:00:16.400> at<00:00:17.090> the

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
bunch of different options but um at the

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.390 
bunch of different options but um at the
42<00:00:17.710> first<00:00:18.710> thing<00:00:18.890> I'm<00:00:18.949> going<00:00:19.039> to<00:00:19.130> talk<00:00:19.279> about

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
42 first thing I'm going to talk about

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.310 
42 first thing I'm going to talk about
is<00:00:19.609> the<00:00:19.640> construction<00:00:20.330> of<00:00:20.419> the<00:00:20.599> board<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.169> its

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
is the construction of the board and its

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.599 
is the construction of the board and its
durability<00:00:22.359> um<00:00:23.470> it's<00:00:24.470> not<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:25.160> strongest

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
durability um it's not the strongest

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.720 
durability um it's not the strongest
board<00:00:26.210> but<00:00:27.079> that<00:00:27.499> might<00:00:28.099> be<00:00:28.130> because<00:00:28.310> I've

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
board but that might be because I've

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.540 
board but that might be because I've
been<00:00:28.789> thrashing<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:29.720> like<00:00:29.869> crazy<00:00:30.289> last<00:00:31.249> few

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
been thrashing it like crazy last few

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.630 
been thrashing it like crazy last few
months<00:00:31.699> I've<00:00:31.970> had<00:00:32.150> it<00:00:32.360> as<00:00:32.509> you<00:00:32.660> can<00:00:32.810> see<00:00:33.640> there

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
months I've had it as you can see there

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.250 
months I've had it as you can see there
ah<00:00:37.840> so<00:00:39.760> if<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:40.970> take<00:00:41.120> good<00:00:41.330> care<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.840> it'll

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
ah so if you take good care of it it'll

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.710 
ah so if you take good care of it it'll
hold<00:00:42.410> up<00:00:42.590> but<00:00:43.190> if<00:00:43.310> you<00:00:43.490> ride<00:00:44.180> in<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.420> rain<00:00:44.690> like

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
hold up but if you ride in the rain like

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.350 
hold up but if you ride in the rain like
me<00:00:45.910> curb<00:00:46.910> it<00:00:47.170> quite<00:00:48.170> often<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.890> will<00:00:49.370> wear<00:00:50.030> and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
me curb it quite often it will wear and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.010 
me curb it quite often it will wear and
it<00:00:50.480> will<00:00:50.600> show<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:52.550> flex<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.330> board<00:00:53.720> I

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
it will show the flex of the board I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.350 
it will show the flex of the board I
think<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.680> Flex<00:00:54.950> is<00:00:55.100> perfect<00:00:55.580> it's<00:00:55.820> not<00:00:56.030> too

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
think the Flex is perfect it's not too

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440 
think the Flex is perfect it's not too
bouncy<00:00:57.080> not<00:00:57.350> too<00:00:57.560> trampoline<00:00:58.190> like<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:59.300> way

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
bouncy not too trampoline like the way

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.350 
bouncy not too trampoline like the way
the<00:00:59.600> Dervish<00:01:00.020> was<00:01:00.230> for<00:01:00.530> me<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.820> way<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.030> weigh

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
the Dervish was for me and I way I weigh

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.149 
the Dervish was for me and I way I weigh
about<00:01:02.480> 115<00:01:03.170> pounds<00:01:04.750> however<00:01:05.750> on<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.740> longer

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
about 115 pounds however on the longer

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.069 
about 115 pounds however on the longer
options<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.909> board<00:01:08.119> my<00:01:08.359> friend<00:01:08.630> has<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
options of the board my friend has the

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.429 
options of the board my friend has the
UM<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.740> longest<00:01:10.159> option<00:01:10.549> available<00:01:10.789> and<00:01:11.439> I'm

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
UM the longest option available and I'm

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.160 
UM the longest option available and I'm
it<00:01:12.710> bottoms<00:01:13.100> out<00:01:13.310> like<00:01:13.969> constantly<00:01:14.630> like<00:01:15.020> I

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
it bottoms out like constantly like I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.660 
it bottoms out like constantly like I
was<00:01:15.350> going<00:01:15.499> to<00:01:15.619> do<00:01:15.740> an<00:01:15.829> early<00:01:16.100> grab<00:01:16.310> on<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.579> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
was going to do an early grab on it the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.760 
was going to do an early grab on it the
other<00:01:16.759> day<00:01:16.969> and<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.630> bottomed<00:01:17.899> out<00:01:18.140> on<00:01:18.320> my<00:01:18.439> hand

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
other day and it bottomed out on my hand

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.219 
other day and it bottomed out on my hand
it's<00:01:19.640> my<00:01:19.759> hand<00:01:20.030> kind<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.329> like<00:01:20.509> give<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.109> up

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
it's my hand kind of like give it up

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.349 
it's my hand kind of like give it up
against<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.469> pavement<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.979> little<00:01:22.189> bit<00:01:22.359> yeah

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
against the pavement a little bit yeah

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.200 
against the pavement a little bit yeah
it<00:01:23.569> wasn't<00:01:23.749> fun<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.409> get<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.310> extra<00:01:25.759> apply

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
it wasn't fun so get the extra apply

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.059 
it wasn't fun so get the extra apply
option<00:01:26.749> if<00:01:26.899> you're<00:01:27.049> going<00:01:27.259> for<00:01:27.649> a<00:01:27.679> bigger

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
option if you're going for a bigger

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:36.669 
option if you're going for a bigger
board<00:01:29.229> and<00:01:30.229> I'm<00:01:31.299> also<00:01:33.429> scored<00:01:34.600> I'm<00:01:35.679> anything

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
board and I'm also scored I'm anything

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.069 
board and I'm also scored I'm anything
you<00:01:36.770> throw<00:01:36.950> at<00:01:37.069> it<00:01:37.219> it<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.700> do<00:01:37.939> just<00:01:38.630> not<00:01:38.840> to

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
you throw at it it can do just not to

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.559 
you throw at it it can do just not to
the<00:01:39.200> effectiveness<00:01:39.829> of<00:01:40.249> a<00:01:40.579> board<00:01:41.509> that

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
the effectiveness of a board that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.590 
the effectiveness of a board that
specialized<00:01:42.469> for<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:42.950> for<00:01:43.340> example<00:01:43.819> it<00:01:44.389> can

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
specialized for that for example it can

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.660 
specialized for that for example it can
take<00:01:44.780> speeds<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.590> up<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.740> 30<00:01:46.459> I've<00:01:46.850> taken<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:48.670> 32

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
take speeds of up to 30 I've taken it 32

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.999 
take speeds of up to 30 I've taken it 32
I<00:01:50.060> think<00:01:50.899> that's<00:01:51.020> my<00:01:51.200> max<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.679> taking<00:01:51.950> this

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
I think that's my max of taking this

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.599 
I think that's my max of taking this
board<00:01:52.280> but<00:01:52.549> um<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.869> can<00:01:54.020> take<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.439> but<00:01:55.039> not<00:01:55.310> to

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
board but um it can take it but not to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.580 
board but um it can take it but not to
the<00:01:55.759> effectiveness<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.810> like<00:01:56.959> a<00:01:56.990> speed<00:01:57.319> board

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the effectiveness of like a speed board

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.859 
the effectiveness of like a speed board
it<00:01:58.039> can<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.729> can<00:01:58.789> slide<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.359> can<00:01:59.479> free<00:01:59.689> ride

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
it can it can slide you can free ride

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.779 
it can it can slide you can free ride
with<00:02:00.049> this<00:02:00.200> board<00:02:00.439> just<00:02:00.679> not<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.279> effect

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
with this board just not to the effect

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.879 
with this board just not to the effect
and<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.329> free<00:02:02.600> ride<00:02:02.749> board<00:02:02.779> so<00:02:03.740> it's

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889 
and this like a free ride board so it's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.620 
and this like a free ride board so it's
all<00:02:03.979> relative<00:02:04.459> but<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.850> works<00:02:05.149> for<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:05.539> about

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
all relative but it works for just about

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.779 
all relative but it works for just about
anything<00:02:05.929> um<00:02:07.090> oh<00:02:08.090> also<00:02:08.990> if<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.340> get<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.610> when

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
anything um oh also if you get it when

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.729 
anything um oh also if you get it when
you're<00:02:10.880> getting<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.180> board<00:02:11.480> get<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.319> gripped

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
you're getting this board get it gripped

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.270 
you're getting this board get it gripped
in<00:02:12.950> some<00:02:13.310> some<00:02:13.939> way<00:02:14.120> don't<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:15.049> buy<00:02:15.230> it
