and berries and things like this so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
and berries and things like this so
lower<00:01:04.320> glycemic<00:01:04.619> level<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.240> five

fiber<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.689> carbohydrates<00:01:09.689> keep

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
fiber in there so carbohydrates keep

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.940 
fiber in there so carbohydrates keep
these<00:01:10.229> around<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.330> 120<00:01:12.330> grams<00:01:12.570> below<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
these around about 120 grams below so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
these around about 120 grams below so
then<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.790> keep<00:01:14.970> below<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> 120<00:01:16.110> grams

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
then if you keep below the 120 grams

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.480 
then if you keep below the 120 grams
you're<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.189> right
