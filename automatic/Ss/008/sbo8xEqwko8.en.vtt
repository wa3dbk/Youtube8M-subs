alright so basically there's going to be

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.630 
alright so basically there's going to be
a<00:00:14.150> game<00:00:14.570> very<00:00:14.900> similar<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.469> what<00:00:15.980> most<00:00:16.309> viewed

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
a game very similar to what most viewed

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.479 
a game very similar to what most viewed
call<00:00:16.970> minesweeper<00:00:17.779> now<00:00:18.680> if<00:00:19.160> you've<00:00:19.369> never

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:19.489 
call minesweeper now if you've never

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.909 
call minesweeper now if you've never
played<00:00:19.640> minesweeper<00:00:20.450> it's<00:00:20.930> on<00:00:21.259> every<00:00:21.710> basic

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
played minesweeper it's on every basic

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.179 
played minesweeper it's on every basic
microsoft<00:00:22.610> computer<00:00:23.390> pretty<00:00:24.200> much<00:00:24.380> but

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
microsoft computer pretty much but

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.589 
microsoft computer pretty much but
basically<00:00:25.430> what<00:00:25.610> you<00:00:25.730> do<00:00:25.880> is<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:26.180> clear<00:00:26.480> an

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
basically what you do is you clear an

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.630 
basically what you do is you clear an
area<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.200> you<00:00:27.349> search<00:00:27.590> for<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.860> mines<00:00:28.070> well

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
area and you search for the mines well

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.690 
area and you search for the mines well
in<00:00:28.790> this<00:00:28.849> case<00:00:29.090> you're<00:00:29.390> searching<00:00:29.570> for<00:00:29.779> the

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
in this case you're searching for the

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.040 
in this case you're searching for the
different<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:31.790> know<00:00:31.939> where<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.480> plants<00:00:32.960> are

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
different you know where the plants are

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.049 
different you know where the plants are
so<00:00:33.829> what<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:34.160> have<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.370> three<00:00:34.730> basic

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
so what you have is three basic

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.090 
so what you have is three basic
functions<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:35.899> have<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:36.170> dig<00:00:36.410> function<00:00:36.890> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
functions you have the dig function and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.150 
functions you have the dig function and
inspect<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.210> flag<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:39.350> inspect<00:00:39.739> allows<00:00:40.010> you

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
inspect in a flag the inspect allows you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.150 
inspect in a flag the inspect allows you
to<00:00:40.309> know<00:00:40.489> what's<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.239> hole<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.320> dig<00:00:42.589> digs

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
to know what's in the hole the dig digs

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.860 
to know what's in the hole the dig digs
the<00:00:43.339> whole<00:00:43.519> if<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.760> notes<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.239> there's<00:00:44.600> not

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
the whole if you notes and there's not

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.900 
the whole if you notes and there's not
see<00:00:45.109> there<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.679> the<00:00:46.039> flag<00:00:46.280> will<00:00:46.519> mark<00:00:46.760> if

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
see there and the flag will mark if

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.310 
see there and the flag will mark if
there's<00:00:47.179> a<00:00:47.239> seed<00:00:47.539> which<00:00:47.719> will<00:00:47.899> get<00:00:48.019> you<00:00:48.170> more

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
there's a seed which will get you more

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.959 
there's a seed which will get you more
points<00:00:48.999> okay<00:00:49.999> so<00:00:50.449> in<00:00:50.749> this<00:00:51.640> basically<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.760> try

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
points okay so in this basically you try

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.579 
points okay so in this basically you try
to<00:00:53.030> do<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.769> so<00:00:54.769> when<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:55.339> inspect<00:00:55.699> it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
to do that and so when you inspect it

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.959 
to do that and so when you inspect it
proves<00:00:57.589> your<00:00:57.829> chances<00:00:58.280> of<00:00:58.309> whether<00:00:58.760> you'll

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
proves your chances of whether you'll

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.750 
proves your chances of whether you'll
find<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.300> seat<00:00:59.510> or<00:00:59.539> not<00:01:00.010> hopefully<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:01.339> will<00:01:01.519> if

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
find a seat or not hopefully you will if

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.420 
find a seat or not hopefully you will if
that<00:01:02.569> you<00:01:03.379> just<00:01:03.559> keep<00:01:03.679> on<00:01:03.859> going<00:01:03.890> around<00:01:04.280> and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
that you just keep on going around and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.810 
that you just keep on going around and
looking<00:01:04.610> alright<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.340> basically<00:01:07.340> what's

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
looking alright so basically what's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.560 
looking alright so basically what's
going<00:01:08.030> on<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:08.329> far<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:08.899> found<00:01:09.170> one<00:01:09.350> flag<00:01:09.619> and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
going on so far is I found one flag and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.590 
going on so far is I found one flag and
you<00:01:11.570> get<00:01:11.750> points<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:12.740> many<00:01:12.920> points<00:01:13.340> for

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
you get points so many points for

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.420 
you get points so many points for
whichever<00:01:14.600> one<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.170> now<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:15.979> see<00:01:16.280> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
whichever one it is now you see the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.389 
whichever one it is now you see the
numbers<00:01:16.640> they're<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.630> ones<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.200> twos<00:01:18.399> so

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
numbers they're the ones and twos so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.929 
numbers they're the ones and twos so
basically<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.180> one<00:01:20.590> marks<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:22.520> how<00:01:22.880> many

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
basically the one marks like how many

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.240 
basically the one marks like how many
seeds<00:01:23.329> are<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.020> area<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.469> it<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
seeds are in the area of it the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.130 
seeds are in the area of it the
tool-mark<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.030> there's<00:01:26.240> two<00:01:26.659> seeds<00:01:26.930> within

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
tool-mark that there's two seeds within

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.740 
tool-mark that there's two seeds within
the<00:01:27.350> area<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.520> basically<00:01:29.090> if<00:01:29.420> you've<00:01:29.570> never

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
the area so basically if you've never

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.810 
the area so basically if you've never
played<00:01:30.020> minesweeper<00:01:30.740> that's<00:01:31.189> how<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.579> works

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
played minesweeper that's how it works

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.779 
played minesweeper that's how it works
otherwise<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.840> should<00:01:32.869> know<00:01:33.200> how<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.350> do<00:01:33.500> this

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
otherwise you should know how to do this

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.899 
otherwise you should know how to do this
okay<00:01:34.789> so<00:01:35.590> basically<00:01:36.590> it's<00:01:37.280> really<00:01:37.670> good<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
okay so basically it's really good to

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.450 
okay so basically it's really good to
inspect<00:01:38.600> because<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.710> means<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.009> lose<00:01:40.189> less

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
inspect because it means you lose less

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.760 
inspect because it means you lose less
flags<00:01:40.759> which<00:01:41.060> means<00:01:41.299> less<00:01:41.719> money<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.350> stashed

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
flags which means less money you stashed

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.130 
flags which means less money you stashed
should<00:01:43.009> play<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.310> mine<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.450> little<00:01:44.780> you

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
should play this mine this little you

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.789 
should play this mine this little you
know<00:01:45.259> quote<00:01:45.560> unquote<00:01:45.649> minigame<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:48.680> know

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
know quote unquote minigame and you know

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.260 
know quote unquote minigame and you know
you<00:01:48.859> get<00:01:49.159> more<00:01:49.340> points<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.850> it's<00:01:49.939> really<00:01:50.119> good

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
you get more points and it's really good

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.050 
you get more points and it's really good
with<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.450> group<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.649> basically<00:01:52.579> what<00:01:52.700> happens

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
with the group so basically what happens

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.539 
with the group so basically what happens
is<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.450> google<00:01:53.780> route<00:01:53.899> which<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.530> get<00:01:54.680> use<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
is the google route which you get use it

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.889 
is the google route which you get use it
on<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.759> rabbit<00:01:56.090> over<00:01:56.450> make<00:01:56.600> them<00:01:56.750> disappear

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
on the rabbit over make them disappear

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.649 
on the rabbit over make them disappear
that<00:01:57.320> go<00:01:57.409> poof<00:01:57.649> gone<00:01:57.920> for<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.210> many<00:01:59.299> minutes

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
that go poof gone for so many minutes

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.880 
that go poof gone for so many minutes
and<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:02.179> another<00:02:02.750> thing<00:02:02.960> with<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.469> inspection

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
and so another thing with the inspection

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.550 
and so another thing with the inspection
going<00:02:04.820> back<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.179> is<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.079> it<00:02:06.200> will<00:02:06.350> take

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
going back to that is that it will take

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.410 
going back to that is that it will take
a<00:02:06.590> few<00:02:06.710> tries<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.399> actually<00:02:07.670> get<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.820> successful

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
a few tries to actually get a successful

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.480 
a few tries to actually get a successful
one<00:02:08.570> or<00:02:08.899> whether<00:02:09.380> it'll<00:02:09.560> say<00:02:09.740> yes<00:02:10.009> there's<00:02:10.340> a

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
one or whether it'll say yes there's a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.120 
one or whether it'll say yes there's a
seed<00:02:11.090> there<00:02:11.270> no<00:02:11.570> there<00:02:11.780> isn't<00:02:12.080> as<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:13.100> just

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
seed there no there isn't as you just

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.220 
seed there no there isn't as you just
see<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:14.120> saw<00:02:14.620> I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
see just saw I

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.430 
see just saw I
did<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.860> flag<00:02:17.159> client<00:02:17.790> which<00:02:18.120> got<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:18.480> both

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
did a to flag client which got me both

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.149 
did a to flag client which got me both
of<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.709> seeds<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.030> with<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.560> get

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
of them seeds and so with that I get

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.130 
of them seeds and so with that I get
more<00:02:23.340> points<00:02:23.519> or<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.299> could<00:02:24.540> get<00:02:24.690> less<00:02:24.870> points

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
more points or I could get less points

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.350 
more points or I could get less points
it's<00:02:25.409> really<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.830> based<00:02:26.069> upon<00:02:26.400> their<00:02:26.610> but

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it's really just based upon their but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.000 
it's really just based upon their but
basically<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.900> farm<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.319> eventually<00:02:28.769> check

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
basically the farm will eventually check

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.009 
basically the farm will eventually check
it<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.610> should<00:02:29.790> stay<00:02:30.030> near<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.810> way<00:02:30.930> you

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
it you should stay near it that way you

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.800 
it you should stay near it that way you
get<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> seeds<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.489> overall<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.780> pretty

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
get the seeds but overall it's a pretty

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.680 
get the seeds but overall it's a pretty
easy<00:02:34.140> minigame<00:02:34.709> pretty<00:02:35.069> catchy<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:36.150> here's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
easy minigame pretty catchy so here's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470 
easy minigame pretty catchy so here's
the<00:02:36.810> rewards<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.060> rewards<00:02:39.390> are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
the rewards so I think the rewards are

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.750 
the rewards so I think the rewards are
good<00:02:39.629> some<00:02:39.900> people<00:02:39.930> don't<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.610> fact

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
good some people don't I like the fact

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.630 
good some people don't I like the fact
that<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:43.319> know<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.709> 6<00:02:43.980> an<00:02:44.160> easy

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
that you can get you know a 6 an easy

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.880 
that you can get you know a 6 an easy
one<00:02:45.060> kxp<00:02:45.599> if<00:02:45.840> you're<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.170> close<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> farm

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
one kxp if you're that close to a farm

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.479 
one kxp if you're that close to a farm
level<00:02:47.190> within<00:02:47.700> an<00:02:48.150> hour<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.750> half<00:02:49.489> really

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
level within an hour and a half really

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
watermelons some really good herbs like

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.080 
watermelons some really good herbs like
Rand<00:02:54.510> ours<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.870> Coram's<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:56.549> got<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.819> bush

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
Rand ours and Coram's you got your bush

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.780 
Rand ours and Coram's you got your bush
seeds<00:02:57.420> not<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> whole<00:02:57.900> lot<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.079> use<00:02:58.260> out<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.530> them

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
seeds not a whole lot of use out of them

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
seeds not a whole lot of use out of them
but<00:02:59.790> then<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.200> really<00:03:01.200> good<00:03:01.379> trees<00:03:01.769> you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
but then you have really good trees you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.430 
but then you have really good trees you
have<00:03:02.400> spirits<00:03:03.000> plan<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.959> all<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.379> but

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
have spirits plan you know all that but

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.009 
have spirits plan you know all that but
then<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.310> best<00:03:05.549> part<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.660> can<00:03:06.840> trade

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
then the best part is that you can trade

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.110 
then the best part is that you can trade
it<00:03:07.109> in<00:03:07.140> for<00:03:07.200> XP<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.340> yeah<00:03:08.489> you'll<00:03:08.730> get<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.000> yes

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it in for XP and yeah you'll get the yes

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.520 
it in for XP and yeah you'll get the yes
to<00:03:09.269> know<00:03:09.450> whether<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.840> want<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.109> do<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.290> or<00:03:10.349> not

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
to know whether you want to do it or not

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.619 
to know whether you want to do it or not
but<00:03:11.160> pretty<00:03:11.370> much<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.940> think<00:03:12.299> it's<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.480> really

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
but pretty much I think it's a really

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.150 
but pretty much I think it's a really
good<00:03:12.750> one<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.980> yeah<00:03:14.660> anyways<00:03:16.160> that's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
good one and so yeah anyways that's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.610 
good one and so yeah anyways that's
about<00:03:17.400> my<00:03:17.549> review<00:03:17.819> for<00:03:17.849> it<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.359> would<00:03:19.290> give<00:03:19.470> it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
about my review for it I would give it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.750 
about my review for it I would give it
about<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.989> 8<00:03:21.989> out<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.440> 10<00:03:22.769> if<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.099> had<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.340> ask<00:03:23.459> me

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
about a 8 out of 10 if you had to ask me

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.240 
about a 8 out of 10 if you had to ask me
but<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.389> think<00:03:24.810> overall<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.099> of<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
but I think overall this is one of the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.759 
but I think overall this is one of the
best<00:03:26.400> route<00:03:26.639> like<00:03:27.000> really<00:03:27.450> releases<00:03:28.440> this

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
best route like really releases this

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.819 
best route like really releases this
year<00:03:29.130> from<00:03:29.880> jagex<00:03:30.359> with<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.200> know<00:03:31.319> Homer

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
year from jagex with you know Homer

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.210
