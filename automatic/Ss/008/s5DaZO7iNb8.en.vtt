 pebble now brings brings flight that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.059

 for having offered a high range of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.030
 creative options with the series to 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.119
 littlebigplanet besides having given him 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.550
 to the game an almost hand made when 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.250
 everyone thought that sackboy would be his 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.890

 on the table pencil paper scissors glue 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.430

 the potential of the foot psvita history 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.850
 It is simple but significant as in the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.820
 good platforms of yesteryear 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.830
 is to take the messenger to his destination but 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.740
 to achieve it you need to evade 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.080
 obstacles of various kinds is fair 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.190
 here where the magic begins since for 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.140
 go ahead 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.240

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.800
 other laptops with the back ero 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.260

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.350
 our traveler jump as well as tear 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.570
 the paper to tear enemies with the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.060
 camera you can give to the 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.760
 inhabitants of this earth the certainty of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.950
 that our world exists and even the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.580
 Motion sensor is crucial for 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.830
 solve several riddles similar use 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.230
 of the hardware suggests that the title 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.750
 would have been excellent to present the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 system at its launch and evidence 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.360
 which is more than an extra control for 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.940
 Remote game adventure as we said 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.740
 tries to explore and discover the 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.100
 connection between the world that you see in 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.040
 screen and yours the riddles are not 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.490
 easy because they require more skill 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.470
 it does not take away the intuitive 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.810
 also and the berries will have a 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.850
 opportunity to try again from 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.340
 the point where you stayed with the 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.610
 possibility of your character getting 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.530
 new habilities 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.230
 this feature does not subtract any 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.510
 merit to the game but it may be 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 something heavy and perhaps boring to those who 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.980
 we have been accustomed to that lives 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.250
 exhaust and the challenges put all the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.440
 possible attention the making is a 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.930
 aspect that will end up charming 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.330
 gamers of all ages everything is 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.060
 made of paper and even relied on 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.310
 real models that as advances in 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.830
 the one that the least detail has 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.810
 colorful and embodies many of the 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.509

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.590
 from one of the happiest soundtracks and 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.960

 recent the adventure of the messengers 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.190
 of paper is a sign that the 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.479
 platform games have still 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.460
 a lot of good cloth paper from which to cut 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:02.340
 However, despite being a very 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.800
 well worked and fun if the games
