best take advantage of the new features
that<00:00:11.440> are<00:00:11.650> available<00:00:11.710> on<00:00:12.190> this<00:00:12.280> machine<00:00:12.460> over

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
that are available on this machine over

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:32.389 
that are available on this machine over
the<00:00:13.089> GPX<00:00:13.480> 4000

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.639 

back<00:00:33.399> on<00:00:33.610> that<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:33.910> know<00:00:34.149> is<00:00:34.690> very<00:00:35.050> similar<00:00:35.530> to

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
back on that you know is very similar to

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
back on that you know is very similar to
old<00:00:35.829> deeply<00:00:36.489> sighs<00:00:36.730> machine

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.150 

so<00:00:50.050> now<00:00:50.170> let's<00:00:50.320> check<00:00:50.559> this<00:00:50.680> five<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.129> half

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
so now let's check this five and a half

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.470 
so now let's check this five and a half
answer<00:00:51.520> this<00:00:51.760> is<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:51.969> one<00:00:52.090> I'm<00:00:52.210> really

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
answer this is the one I'm really

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:07.020 
answer this is the one I'm really
interested<00:00:52.719> in<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.960> shopping<00:01:05.909> today<00:01:06.909> I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
interested in that is shopping today I

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.730 
interested in that is shopping today I
want<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.270> demonstrate<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.899> way<00:01:08.050> seat<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.649> the

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
want to demonstrate the way seat of the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.399 
want to demonstrate the way seat of the
haze<00:01:08.920> on<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.159> GPX<00:01:09.610> 4500<00:01:10.450> what<00:01:10.869> is<00:01:11.050> new<00:01:11.380> about

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
haze on the GPX 4500 what is new about

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.010 
haze on the GPX 4500 what is new about
this<00:01:12.009> detector<00:01:12.490> suite<00:01:13.060> of<00:01:13.210> technologies<00:01:13.330> it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
this detector suite of technologies it

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.840 
this detector suite of technologies it
really<00:01:14.259> overcomes<00:01:14.770> all<00:01:14.979> those<00:01:15.220> problems<00:01:15.640> that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
really overcomes all those problems that

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:26.560 
really overcomes all those problems that
smart<00:01:16.210> electronic<00:01:16.899> timing<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.470> lot

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.280 

then<00:01:27.570> we're<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> save<00:01:28.020> another

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
then we're going to save another

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
then we're going to save another
customer<00:01:28.830> menu<00:01:29.100> setting<00:01:29.869> specifically<00:01:30.869> work

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
customer menu setting specifically work

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
customer menu setting specifically work
on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> same<00:01:31.470> ground<00:01:31.830> type<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> small

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
on the same ground type with a small

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
on the same ground type with a small
model<00:01:33.240> loop<00:01:35.240> there<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.690> coil<00:01:37.040> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
model loop there it is on the coil and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:51.610 
model loop there it is on the coil and
there's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.700> nugget

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.869 
thing I call oscillation a big change
for<00:02:55.480> us<00:02:55.569> so<00:02:56.500> we've<00:02:56.799> would<00:02:57.160> listen<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:57.670> so

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
for us so we've would listen to up so

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.030 
for us so we've would listen to up so
people<00:02:58.209> had<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.599> say<00:02:58.629> and<00:02:58.959> try<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.170> put<00:02:59.860> back
