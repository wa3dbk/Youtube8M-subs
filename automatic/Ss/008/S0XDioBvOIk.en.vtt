folding<00:01:48.770> camper<00:01:49.279> it<00:01:49.369> folds<00:01:49.729> down<00:01:49.789> flat<00:01:50.209> like

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
folding camper it folds down flat like

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.019 
folding camper it folds down flat like
this<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.049> then<00:01:51.709> opens<00:01:52.099> up<00:01:52.249> he's<00:01:52.520> looking<00:01:52.669> for

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:53.029 
this and then opens up he's looking for

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.629 
this and then opens up he's looking for
an<00:01:53.119> angel<00:01:53.539> investor<00:01:54.109> and<00:01:54.889> it's<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.159> really<00:01:55.459> nice

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.609 
an angel investor and it's a really nice
design<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.749> idea<00:01:57.079> is<00:01:57.109> so<00:01:57.289> you've<00:01:57.439> got

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
design but the idea is so you've got

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.909 
design but the idea is so you've got
aerodynamic<00:01:58.989> when<00:01:59.989> you're<00:02:00.109> like<00:02:00.319> a<00:02:00.349> cap<00:02:00.649> for<00:02:00.889> a

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:00.919 
aerodynamic when you're like a cap for a

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:02.830 
aerodynamic when you're like a cap for a
truck<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.219> becomes<00:02:01.609> a<00:02:01.700> gapper<00:02:01.909> yeah<00:02:02.359> then<00:02:02.719> it

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
truck that becomes a gapper yeah then it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.080 
truck that becomes a gapper yeah then it
pops<00:02:03.259> up<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.619> can<00:02:03.739> stand<00:02:03.979> up<00:02:04.189> here<00:02:04.219> this

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
pops up and you can stand up here this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.269 
pops up and you can stand up here this

then the band of windows that goes all

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.619 
then the band of windows that goes all
the<00:02:42.950> way<00:02:43.099> around<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.000> really<00:02:44.389> almost

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
the way around it so you really almost

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.990 
the way around it so you really almost
feel<00:02:44.959> like<00:02:44.989> you're<00:02:45.319> outside<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.609> it's<00:02:46.700> only

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
feel like you're outside and it's only

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.159 
feel like you're outside and it's only
78<00:02:47.450> square<00:02:47.930> feet<00:02:48.290> but<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.329> 360<00:02:50.959> view

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
78 square feet but it's like a 360 view

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.720 
78 square feet but it's like a 360 view
which<00:02:51.500> we<00:02:51.950> were<00:02:52.069> talking<00:02:52.189> about<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.489> little

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
which we were talking about this little

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.190 
which we were talking about this little
slide<00:02:52.909> shows<00:02:53.150> we've<00:02:53.359> been<00:02:53.510> doing<00:02:53.720> four<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.079> the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
slide shows we've been doing four on the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.379 
slide shows we've been doing four on the
stage<00:02:54.409> but<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:55.519> really<00:02:55.669> tricks<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.359> into

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
stage but it really tricks you into

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.819 
stage but it really tricks you into
thinking<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.900> more<00:02:57.049> space<00:02:57.290> than<00:02:57.439> yeah<00:02:57.560> yeah

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
thinking of more space than yeah yeah

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.159 
thinking of more space than yeah yeah
yeah<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.609> like<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:59.030> bed<00:02:59.389> at<00:02:59.569> one<00:02:59.719> end<00:02:59.930> I

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
yeah and I like the bed at one end I

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.869 
yeah and I like the bed at one end I
don't<00:03:00.469> really<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:00.859> these<00:03:01.040> beds<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.609> lofts

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879
