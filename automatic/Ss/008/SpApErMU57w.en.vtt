tekwar 11 and here I'm taking the LG g3

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.010 
tekwar 11 and here I'm taking the LG g3
in<00:00:05.520> testing<00:00:05.850> out<00:00:05.940> speaker<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.600> then

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
in testing out speaker and then

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.650 
in testing out speaker and then
comparing<00:00:07.410> it<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.980> Galaxy<00:00:08.490> s5<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.120> HTC

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
comparing it to the Galaxy s5 and HTC

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.690 
comparing it to the Galaxy s5 and HTC
One<00:00:09.929> m8<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.920> course<00:00:11.130> these<00:00:11.250> are<00:00:11.309> probably

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
One m8 of course these are probably

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.879 
One m8 of course these are probably
three<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.389> hottest<00:00:12.750> phones<00:00:13.230> out<00:00:13.500> there<00:00:13.559> on

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
three of the hottest phones out there on

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.799 
three of the hottest phones out there on
the<00:00:13.980> market<00:00:14.340> right<00:00:14.490> now<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.660> some

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
the market right now there are some

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.090 
the market right now there are some
other<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.289> nice<00:00:16.470> ones<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:16.859> there<00:00:17.039> but

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
other really nice ones out there but

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.710 
other really nice ones out there but
these<00:00:17.310> are<00:00:17.520> three<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.119> will

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
these are three that I think will

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
these are three that I think will
probably<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> most<00:00:19.320> popular<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
probably be the most popular now of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.910 
probably be the most popular now of
course<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.970> s5<00:00:21.510> has<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.199> kind<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> small

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
course the s5 has the kind of small

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.859 
course the s5 has the kind of small
speaker<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.970> looks<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.180> similar<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
speaker but it looks very similar to the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.279 
speaker but it looks very similar to the
g3<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.189> test<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.119> sounds<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
g3 so on test out how that sounds and of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.130 
g3 so on test out how that sounds and of
course<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.769> HTC<00:00:29.310> One<00:00:29.609> m8<00:00:30.060> has<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.779> very

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
course the HTC One m8 has the very

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.610 
course the HTC One m8 has the very
famous<00:00:31.550> front-facing<00:00:32.570> stereo<00:00:33.570> speakers<00:00:34.410> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
famous front-facing stereo speakers that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
famous front-facing stereo speakers that
really<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.520> awesome<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.329> we'll<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
really are awesome but we'll see how the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
really are awesome but we'll see how the
g3<00:00:37.230> compares<00:00:37.530> against<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> might<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
g3 compares against it you might be a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.520 
g3 compares against it you might be a
little<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.700> surprised<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.170> hard<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> do

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
little bit surprised now it's hard to do

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
little bit surprised now it's hard to do
audio<00:00:40.920> tests<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.399> YouTube<00:00:41.790> due<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
audio tests on YouTube due to the

I'm<00:00:48.660> sorry<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> had<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.829> something

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I'm sorry but I had to get something

00:00:49.980 --> 00:02:57.759 
I'm sorry but I had to get something
royalty-free

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.319 

so<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.799> was<00:02:58.950> actually<00:02:59.219> extremely<00:02:59.370> surprised<00:03:00.060> by

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
so I was actually extremely surprised by

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.059 
so I was actually extremely surprised by
the<00:03:00.390> results<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:00.989> base<00:03:01.469> off<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.709> graphs

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
the results of this base off the graphs

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.399 
the results of this base off the graphs
it<00:03:02.340> shows<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.819> g3<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.450> its<00:03:03.540> highs<00:03:03.780> were

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
it shows that the g3 and its highs were

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.009 
it shows that the g3 and its highs were
louder<00:03:04.739> than<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.280> HTC<00:03:05.939> One<00:03:06.269> m8

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
louder than the HTC One m8

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.140 
louder than the HTC One m8
now<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.230> MA<00:03:07.650> had<00:03:07.859> an<00:03:07.950> overall<00:03:08.430> better<00:03:08.760> sound

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
now the MA had an overall better sound

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.970 
now the MA had an overall better sound
that<00:03:09.359> lows<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.840> mids<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.500> was<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.680> little<00:03:10.890> bit

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that lows the mids it was a little bit

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.130 
that lows the mids it was a little bit
higher<00:03:11.159> than<00:03:11.280> g3<00:03:11.819> s<00:03:11.879> but<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.390> g3<00:03:12.900> was

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
higher than g3 s but the g3 was

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.740 
higher than g3 s but the g3 was
generally<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.650> as<00:03:14.189> well<00:03:14.370> as<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.579> m8<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.269> think

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
generally just as well as the m8 I think

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
generally just as well as the m8 I think
I<00:03:15.810> may<00:03:15.959> have<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.260> do<00:03:16.439> with<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:17.040> being<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
I may have to do with it being on the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.690 
I may have to do with it being on the
table<00:03:17.760> kind<00:03:17.909> of<00:03:18.000> amplifying<00:03:18.569> it<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.099> m8

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
table kind of amplifying it but the m8

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.670 
table kind of amplifying it but the m8
was<00:03:20.879> definitely<00:03:21.209> crisper<00:03:21.720> cleaner<00:03:22.109> had<00:03:22.500> more

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
was definitely crisper cleaner had more

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.009 
was definitely crisper cleaner had more
bass<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.189> was<00:03:23.849> much<00:03:24.030> better<00:03:24.180> experience<00:03:24.420> for

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
bass it was much better experience for

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.160 
bass it was much better experience for
the<00:03:25.109> g3<00:03:25.680> was<00:03:25.889> about<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.420> loud<00:03:27.689> based<00:03:28.019> off

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
the g3 was about just as loud based off

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.429 
the g3 was about just as loud based off
the<00:03:28.319> graphs<00:03:28.590> as<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.459> m8<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.659> it<00:03:30.780> was<00:03:30.930> really

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
the graphs as the m8 so it was really

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.399 
the graphs as the m8 so it was really
interesting<00:03:32.060> I'll<00:03:33.060> finish<00:03:33.420> with<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.840> test

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
interesting I'll finish with a test

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.890 
interesting I'll finish with a test
comparing<00:03:34.889> them<00:03:35.040> where<00:03:35.400> I'll<00:03:35.669> play<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.720> song

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
comparing them where I'll play the song

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.149 
comparing them where I'll play the song
out<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.439> switch<00:03:37.650> between<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.129> different

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
out and switch between the different

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.789 
out and switch between the different
phone<00:03:38.669> so<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:38.939> can<00:03:39.090> get<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.569> final<00:03:39.900> test<00:03:40.169> make

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
phone so you can get a final test make

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.780 
phone so you can get a final test make
