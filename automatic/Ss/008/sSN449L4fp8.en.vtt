00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
by three methods it actually stimulates

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
by three methods it actually stimulates
the<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.089> cells<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> hair<00:00:54.989> follicle<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the the cells in the hair follicle to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.029 
the the cells in the hair follicle to
regrow<00:00:56.249> hair<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.749> lost<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.800> then<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
regrow hair that that's lost but then it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.130 
regrow hair that that's lost but then it
also<00:00:59.219> stimulates<00:00:59.640> blood<00:01:00.390> flow<00:01:00.539> through<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
also stimulates blood flow through the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.829 
also stimulates blood flow through the
scalp<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.399> reduces<00:01:02.940> inflammation<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.749> the

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
scalp and it reduces inflammation in the

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.360 
scalp and it reduces inflammation in the
hair<00:01:03.960> follicle<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.620> all<00:01:04.739> three<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> those

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
hair follicle and all three of those

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.060 
hair follicle and all three of those
methods<00:01:05.700> together<00:01:06.120> will<00:01:07.050> cause<00:01:07.380> hair<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
methods together will cause hair to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
methods together will cause hair to
regrow<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.910> cause<00:01:09.120> new<00:01:09.360> follicles<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
regrow and will cause new follicles to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.390 
regrow and will cause new follicles to
form<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> amazing<00:01:11.100> we're

diodes<00:01:37.050> we're<00:01:37.200> talking<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.650> yeah<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
diodes we're talking about yeah and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.290 
diodes we're talking about yeah and
those<00:01:38.010> just<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> painless<00:01:39.030> right

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
those just and this is painless right
