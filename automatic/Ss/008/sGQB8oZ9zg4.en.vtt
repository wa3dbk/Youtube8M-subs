and he's always in the right place at
the<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.450> finesse<00:01:12.810> shot

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the right time now that's a finesse shot

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320 
the right time now that's a finesse shot
and<00:01:13.260> once<00:01:13.500> again<00:01:13.650> he<00:01:14.040> works<00:01:14.400> hard<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> he<00:01:15.090> will

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.789 
tackle the players and his Vanessa's are
actually<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.810> found<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> most

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
actually really good I found that most

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
actually really good I found that most
of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> finesse<00:01:20.729> shots<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.119> took<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.450> him<00:01:21.600> did

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of the finesse shots I took with him did

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
of the finesse shots I took with him did
go<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.110> although<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.920> wasn't<00:01:23.130> too<00:01:23.460> great

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
go in although that one wasn't too great

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.600 
go in although that one wasn't too great
but<00:01:23.970> anyway<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:26.130> showing<00:01:26.189> his

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but anyway this is just showing his

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
but anyway this is just showing his
dribbling<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.900> weave<00:01:28.110> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
dribbling and the way you can weave in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.569 
dribbling and the way you can weave in
and<00:01:28.409> out<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> players<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> really

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and out of players and then a really

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
and out of players and then a really
nice<00:01:29.820> chip<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.570> finishing<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.229> probably<00:01:31.500> one

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
nice chip it's finishing is probably one

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.200 
nice chip it's finishing is probably one
of<00:01:31.650> his<00:01:31.770> stronger<00:01:32.310> attributes<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:33.060> mean

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
of his stronger attributes i mean

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
of his stronger attributes i mean
honestly<00:01:33.540> he<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> finish<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.619> most<00:01:34.920> places

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
honestly he can finish from most places

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 
honestly he can finish from most places
whether<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> chip<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.540> finesse<00:01:36.900> shot<00:01:36.930> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
whether it's a chip of finesse shot is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.610 
whether it's a chip of finesse shot is
overall<00:01:38.009> shooting<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.850> great<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
overall shooting is really great and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.220 
overall shooting is really great and
