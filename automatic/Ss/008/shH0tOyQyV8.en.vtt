00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.829 
yeah I think we were more composed today
I<00:06:23.889> think<00:06:24.550> we<00:06:24.669> got<00:06:24.819> into<00:06:25.029> our<00:06:25.150> attacking<00:06:25.659> play<00:06:25.810> a

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
I think we got into our attacking play a

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:26.999 
I think we got into our attacking play a
little<00:06:25.960> bit<00:06:26.110> better<00:06:26.229> our<00:06:26.379> exit<00:06:26.710> game<00:06:26.860> was

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
little bit better our exit game was

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.680 
little bit better our exit game was
better<00:06:27.129> overall<00:06:28.029> I<00:06:28.120> felt<00:06:28.360> like<00:06:28.449> we<00:06:28.569> just

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
better overall I felt like we just

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.089 
better overall I felt like we just
gelled<00:06:28.900> a<00:06:29.020> bit<00:06:29.139> better<00:06:29.259> which<00:06:29.440> I<00:06:29.560> said<00:06:29.770> last

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099
