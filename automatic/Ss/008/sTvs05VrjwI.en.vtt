most part and the dumbbells only go up
to<00:00:36.450> 75<00:00:37.700> but<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.210> most<00:00:39.329> people

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to 75 but what I think what most people

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.350 
to 75 but what I think what most people
lose<00:00:40.230> track<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.149> still

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
lose track of is that like you can still

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.139 
lose track of is that like you can still
do<00:00:42.800> bench<00:00:43.800> press<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> still<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.640> deadlift

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
do bench press you still do deadlift

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.229 
do bench press you still do deadlift
still<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.510> squats<00:00:46.039> my<00:00:47.039> mind<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.910> there's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

also<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.750> plate<00:00:49.559> weight<00:00:49.920> out<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> Lake<00:00:50.430> press<00:00:50.780> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
also a plate weight out of Lake press so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.139 
also a plate weight out of Lake press so
there's<00:00:52.140> still<00:00:52.350> things<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:54.000> what

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
there's still things you can do but what

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.180 
there's still things you can do but what
most<00:00:54.300> people<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.809> feel<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:56.039> away

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
most people I feel like they take away

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
most people I feel like they take away
from<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.059> less<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.690> don't

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
from it more or less is that they don't

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
from it more or less is that they don't
understand<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> could<00:00:58.530> still<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:59.699> those

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
understand that you could still do those

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.560 
understand that you could still do those
multi-joint<00:01:00.899> exercises<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:02.070> mean<00:01:02.760> ideally

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
multi-joint exercises I mean ideally

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.789 
multi-joint exercises I mean ideally
it's<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.409> big<00:01:04.589> mass

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it's not going to be your big mass

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's not going to be your big mass
gainer<00:01:05.450> but<00:01:07.280> instead<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> focusing<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:08.970> those

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
gainer but instead of focusing on those

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
gainer but instead of focusing on those
then<00:01:09.570> go<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.380> isolation<00:01:11.070> movements<00:01:11.189> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
then go do isolation movements like

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
then go do isolation movements like
today's<00:01:12.420> chest<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:12.960> me<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> start
