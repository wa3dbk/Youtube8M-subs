00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
for destroying most of that information

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.569 
for destroying most of that information
about<00:00:30.510> evidence<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:32.160> very<00:00:32.430> very

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.049 
direction and we lost all that
information<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.460> their<00:00:53.579> knowledge<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:54.030> have

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
information and their knowledge we have

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.939 
information and their knowledge we have
snippets<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.260> we've<00:00:55.440> managed<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
snippets of that that we've managed to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.639 
snippets of that that we've managed to
put<00:00:56.190> back<00:00:56.370> together<00:00:56.579> from<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.930> few

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
put back together from the the few

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.660 
put back together from the the few
documents<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.030> were<00:01:00.180> saved<00:01:01.430> but<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> was

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
documents that were saved but that was

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
documents that were saved but that was
enough<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> show<00:01:03.390> us<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
enough to show us that there was a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
enough to show us that there was a
wealth<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.280> knowledge<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> information<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
wealth of knowledge and information that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.690 
wealth of knowledge and information that
they<00:01:06.630> were<00:01:06.689> given<00:01:07.110> by<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:07.560> very<00:01:07.950> informed

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
they were given by some very informed

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870 
they were given by some very informed
and<00:01:08.820> advanced<00:01:09.450> beings<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.260> gave<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and advanced beings that gave them that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
and advanced beings that gave them that
knowledge<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.450> information<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.650> don't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
knowledge and that information we don't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
knowledge and that information we don't
have<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> today<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.740> um<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:18.090> information

have that today and um that information

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
have that today and um that information
tells<00:01:18.840> us<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> every<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.220> many<00:01:20.250> thousand

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
tells us that every so many thousand

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
tells us that every so many thousand
years<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.360> earth<00:01:21.780> goes<00:01:22.200> through<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> cycle<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
years the earth goes through a cycle and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.469 
years the earth goes through a cycle and

what the cycles are we still don't know

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.969 
what the cycles are we still don't know
but<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.780> those<00:01:30.869> cycles<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.650> supposed

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
but one of those cycles is not supposed

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.940 
but one of those cycles is not supposed
to<00:01:32.130> come<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.490> end<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> 2012<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> hail<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.799> a

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
is system that I've started promoting

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.760 
is system that I've started promoting
research<00:05:29.919> for<00:05:30.849> the<00:05:30.940> last<00:05:31.060> two<00:05:31.270> years<00:05:31.770> revolves

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
research for the last two years revolves

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.279

around<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.550> world<00:05:33.940> like<00:05:34.330> money<00:05:34.659> but<00:05:35.260> even

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
around this a world like money but even

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.110 
around this a world like money but even
more<00:05:35.620> important<00:05:36.039> is<00:05:36.099> a<00:05:36.159> world<00:05:36.460> without<00:05:36.580> value

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
more important is a world without value

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.060 
more important is a world without value
because<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.870> moment<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.260> attach<00:05:38.530> of<00:05:38.680> value

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
because the moment you attach of value

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.830 
because the moment you attach of value
to<00:05:39.099> something<00:05:39.430> he<00:05:39.909> started<00:05:40.240> creating<00:05:40.510> a

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
to something he started creating a

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.600 
to something he started creating a
hierarchy<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:41.919> you<00:05:42.010> start<00:05:42.250> creating<00:05:42.310> a

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
hierarchy and you start creating a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.670 
hierarchy and you start creating a
barter<00:05:42.970> system<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.870> barter<00:05:44.199> system<00:05:44.229> and

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
barter system and the barter system and
