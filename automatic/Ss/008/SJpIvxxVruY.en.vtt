00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
weed problems things like that we've

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.880 
weed problems things like that we've
actually<00:01:58.360> started<00:01:58.840> Bale<00:01:59.020> grazing<00:01:59.350> and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
actually started Bale grazing and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.310 
actually started Bale grazing and
feeding<00:02:00.520> our<00:02:00.670> yearlings<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.479> small<00:02:01.840> paddocks

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.800 
feeding our yearlings in small paddocks
on<00:02:02.590> them<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.970> winter<00:02:04.210> time<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.659> we're

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
on them in the winter time and we're

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.960 
on them in the winter time and we're
finding<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.259> huge<00:02:05.650> turnaround<00:02:06.220> we're<00:02:06.670> adding

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
finding a huge turnaround we're adding

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.019 
finding a huge turnaround we're adding
basically<00:02:07.930> adding<00:02:08.590> adding<00:02:09.129> that<00:02:09.429> manure<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:10.029 
basically adding adding that manure and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.879 
basically adding adding that manure and
we're<00:02:10.599> adding<00:02:10.749> organic<00:02:11.019> matter<00:02:11.349> back<00:02:11.739> the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:11.889 
we're adding organic matter back the

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.770 
we're adding organic matter back the
soil<00:02:12.129> and<00:02:12.249> cover<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.790> soil<00:02:13.060> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
soil and cover to the soil and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.960 
soil and cover to the soil and
letting<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.170> basically<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.400> rangelands

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
letting the basically the the rangelands

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.940 
letting the basically the the rangelands
kind<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.330> healing<00:02:16.780> itself<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.560> way<00:02:17.709> then

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
kind of healing itself that way then

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.920 
kind of healing itself that way then
most<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.850> stuff<00:02:19.090> we're<00:02:19.300> feeding<00:02:19.450> on<00:02:19.720> is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
most of this stuff we're feeding on is

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.470 
most of this stuff we're feeding on is
old<00:02:20.230> CRP<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.030> not<00:02:22.270> real

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
old CRP that you know it's not real

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.550 
old CRP that you know it's not real
great<00:02:22.750> as<00:02:23.020> far<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.650> productivity<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.440> we'll

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
great as far as productivity so we'll

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.220 
great as far as productivity so we'll
feed<00:02:26.709> on<00:02:26.860> those<00:02:27.040> areas<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.780> first<00:02:28.990> year<00:02:29.200> I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
feed on those areas the first year I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.080 
feed on those areas the first year I
kind<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.709> spread<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:29.980> out<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:30.640> there's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
kind of spread it out to see if there's

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.250 
kind of spread it out to see if there's
going<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.300> be<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.480> different<00:02:31.900> thing<00:02:31.930> those

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
going to be a different thing those

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.229 
going to be a different thing those
areas<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.890> there<00:02:33.100> was<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.310> huge<00:02:33.580> difference<00:02:34.030> on

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
areas and there was a huge difference on

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.510

them<00:02:34.480> some<00:02:34.989> producers<00:02:35.500> think<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.950> cows<00:02:36.190> will

waste hay by laying on it but cows will

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.920
