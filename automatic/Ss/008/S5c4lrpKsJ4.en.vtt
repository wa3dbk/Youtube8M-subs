00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 we have to use the shells for 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.570
 achieve access to the star coins 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.710

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.710
 the first star coin 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.470
 let's take the next shell 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.629
 there with care there we walk the little mushroom 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.440
 yellow to see what I'm going to throw very well 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.079
 we wait to see what happens 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.510
 care very well with good care I 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.870
 I recommend that you eat this mario costume 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.149
 helicopter because I found it easier 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.339
 this level with this costume or not the eye 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.699
 yellow he lost his suit but let's 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.960
 continue or not keep losing I invite you 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.330
 very good there the yellow eye goes to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.610
 carry a shell here we do not see 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.240
 nothing interesting so let's go 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:15.490
 continue one carefully with the compas 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.119
 that walk around very well let's continue or 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.850
 no but it would take me died because it revived 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.409
 the turtle very well there I will wait 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.659
 that revive the yellow eye we're going to a 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.659
 hit yellow very well now we have to 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.179
 pass this level and calm down very well 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.429
 very well taken care of a yellow scream not to the 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.830
 yellow field died again but here 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.890
 I'm going to try to help very well there 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.069
 I already have three carapaces the bad thing is that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.050
 the turtles get very fast we go 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.570
 a yellow scream 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.880
 we are doing very well the strip pulls that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.300
 nice shell very well let's continue 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.250
 while he launched that very careful carcass 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.440
 well here we have to throw you with 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.360
 careful to get the second 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.730
 star coin 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.040
 well I also threw my shell 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.120
 but I think it will not help us to 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.920
 to be able to open and obtain the second currency 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.729
 very good star that we have to do 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.590
 something 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.820
 the only yellow will eat his mushroom 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.830
 very good to see let's see if you can 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.320
 do something there very well very well 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.810
 careful yellow we go up very well 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.660
 well here we would need to create a shell 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.730
 I'm going to try to get it because it's not going 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.500
 to have another way to achieve this 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.830
 level to eat that star coin that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.980
 we lack good we know that for the other 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.190
 side there is no way because we have to 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.100
 use a shell to break it there 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.910
 those blocks tells the case that arrives 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.090
 some out there but do not think there so 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.090
 what 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.480
 you can not get it so good 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.230
 come on, time is running out 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.269
 so we better go back for a 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.760
 a shell when I take it off yellow 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.610
 He died I'll have to go back we will 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.200
 very good why this suit is important 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.360
 very well there we see a compa a compass 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.459
 a turtle let's take him his 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.200
 I'm going to throw the green guide 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.060
 very well very well let's go let's go 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.400
 we go and there it is very good and there we enter 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.680
 and we eat the second star coin and 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.560
 we can already see the third coin 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.049
 star that we see up there good for 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.030
 start third the star now 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.579
 I'm going to explain to them they have to use 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.769
 another shell and throw it in the block 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.660
 that is below me just below me 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.660
 in that block they have to throw the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.190
 shell but now as I do not have me 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.060
 I'm going to help from the yellow field to 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.859
 achieve climbing up there very well we go 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 that we run out of time we are already 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.840
