00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.930
 and her boy 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:30.390
 even the transfer here forgot the text but 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:37.850
 now it's better not to let it out there 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:44.180
 wait till tomorrow we don't know yet 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 yet still think it over till tomorrow, will play 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 Well, there will be a little play 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.070
 Tomorrow also made a decrease in volume. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.460
 date on rolling see how much he 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 and maybe because there are questions 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.799
 associated with grass explain for example 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.000
 Americans have almost no chest 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.720
 boost potatoes 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.140
 Well, I said then that in front of the gate 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.460
 our front they were somewhere 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 quicker can be persevering to us 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.210
 it is necessary to sort out if you remember with 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 Americans how not to speak it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 first goal so what do we need 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.570
 These are the plans for the power of the Americans 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.730
 do the radio with the Swiss 3 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.400
 petak petak petak interference arteries 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.390
 this is the main thing that we need no time 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.940
 tidy up 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.340
 of the players also catch on just 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.340
 Do not give to finish the same time there 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.380
 i'm working i'm working let's say protection for them 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.960
 also say weaker than their attack 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.540
 how much carrier is weaker than the edge 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.350
 the walls of six individuals I will not say no 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.240
 in theory 6h it's okay just 7 always 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.869
 was then short of breath can eat 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.060
 some players let's say young like 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.980
 million or he and another time 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.530
 there was always 17 min now we get for 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.690
 twenty is already a little bit 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.370
 turns out over its own limit and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.630
 just we can do tiredness 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.640
 make some mistake 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.650
 to avoid it because always but 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.680
 when our needed the seventh which 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.450
 slightly reduces the playing time 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.920
 some players are very cool to shoot 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.800
 with the swedes you can explain why with 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 30 became 33 that we released well, a little bit 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.930
 old maybe academically wanted 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.740
 This is where you can throw then after 5 extra 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.800
 pass a little lost got the player then 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.370
 that the first goal we scored trails 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.970
 gave these moments on the penny that 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.040
 such are pushing the corner and many 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 hockey players talk about the rest of the play 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.980
 activists painted of course I understand that 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.560
 Protect defenders up from inexperienced 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 the availability of them will take the load off 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.409
 have themselves to this point, it is one of our 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.750
 attack on say stronger than defense against 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.220
 defense by and large wrong 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.280
 would defensively play because 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.680
 our attack is more powerful if it is more powerful 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.569
 need to use need to play more there 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.129
 so that the playerâ€™s ears are there and more 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.129
 claim them salting 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:37.110

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.540
 tomorrow what you need to drive video 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.579
 say all the same that the main work 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.650
 Minsk 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.720

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 that we will be as outline yes but 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.730
