00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
got from Petsmart from the house rat and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.350 
got from Petsmart from the house rat and
hamster<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:52.290> looks<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.890> life<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:54.000> yeah

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
hamster that looks like my life so yeah

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.889 
hamster that looks like my life so yeah
and<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:55.590> there's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.040> door<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> opens

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and then there's a door and it opens

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.760 
and then there's a door and it opens
like<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:59.479> it's<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.600> mean<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.170> reason<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
like that it's I mean the reason I have

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
like that it's I mean the reason I have
a<00:02:01.799> roof<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.729> well<00:02:03.450> dancers<00:02:03.899> are

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
a roof is because well dancers are

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
a roof is because well dancers are
nocturnal<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.909> thinking<00:02:06.540> they

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
nocturnal and so I was thinking they

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.930 
nocturnal and so I was thinking they
probably<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.799> dark

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
probably like the dark

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.900 
probably like the dark
and<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.930> these<00:02:10.620> are<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.010> puzzle<00:02:11.340> pieces<00:02:11.370> for

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
and so these are some puzzle pieces for

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.320 
and so these are some puzzle pieces for
that<00:02:12.000> Jamaican<00:02:12.480> six<00:02:13.250> enemies<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.460> fences<00:02:14.820> so

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
that Jamaican six enemies and fences so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.880 
that Jamaican six enemies and fences so
we<00:02:15.450> closed<00:02:16.170> them<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:18.380> that'll<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.500> all<00:02:19.620> for<00:02:19.650> now

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
we closed them so that'll be all for now

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.210 
we closed them so that'll be all for now
thanks<00:02:20.490> for<00:02:20.520> watching<00:02:20.970> bye
