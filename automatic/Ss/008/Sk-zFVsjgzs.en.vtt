00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.719
 capturing the pokemon is vital for 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.560
 this video I'm featuring with 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.600

 now it's my turn with yvan 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:35.040
 attal 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:54.059
 I will not kill him the first time so 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.610

 beaten and this is a non- thematic 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.540
 I do the cinematic all that I did not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.540
 really backup and role that even 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:26.640
 knopf united states maybe do a 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:30.200
 little quick little feature I find 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.200
 that the brightness is a little sad 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.789

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.030

 not this practice 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 unfortunately I fold agree that a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.929

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.709

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:26.490
 continue quietly the duotone 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.630
 lowering his Canadian then puts back to himself 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.250
 half of his life is this shot no 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:54.870
 in more rooms regenerates then the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.270
 master bowl on diamond and pearl between 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.720

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.370
 to capture I'll start right away 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:01.100
 with a hyperbole here I did 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.100
 the stock 42 hyperbole it's gone 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:14.069
 1 it came out logically now 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:18.359
 he will attack will regenerate no 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.870
 continuous work on a receipt a second 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:29.389

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:51.199
 paralyzes what he's not going so he has so I 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.789
 still want to specify the pokemon 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.240
 advantage without backing up I had tried 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.680
 already catching me a first time 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.629
 it was what was happen very quickly 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.120
 a hyperbole is really to be 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:07.650
 caught the first time though 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.620
 I had not filmed as I was holding 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.090
 really assumed the pokemon put forward 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.050
 of this version since it is present 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.050
 on nintendo case and it's really finished 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:33.569
 1 what to catch it is caught nivet 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:41.250
 in the ball the digital data is 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:42.599
 added to the pokedex ten years that the end 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.699
 of his life is close he sucks 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.069
 inforsistem of the pangs of living beings 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.740
 he returns to the state of vital cocoon 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:57.089
 during I bugged something to 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:05.009

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:07.620
 a darkness type flight here is mine 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.849
