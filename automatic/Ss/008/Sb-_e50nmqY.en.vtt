brought you here today to just show you
a<00:00:33.900> little<00:00:33.960> example<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> tools

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
a little example of one of the tools

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100 
a little example of one of the tools
that<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.670> use<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:35.910> wildlife<00:00:36.420> management<00:00:36.990> and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that we use in wildlife management and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
that we use in wildlife management and
that<00:00:37.560> tool<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.250> called<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> trail<00:00:38.970> camera<00:00:39.240> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that tool is called the trail camera and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500 
that tool is called the trail camera and
the<00:00:40.410> way<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:40.680> trail<00:00:40.950> cameras<00:00:41.400> work<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.940> they

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the way these trail cameras work is they

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.370 
the way these trail cameras work is they
have<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:43.070> sensor<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.580> front<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.060> that<00:00:45.780> are

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
have a sensor on the front here that are

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.160 
have a sensor on the front here that are
triggers<00:00:47.130> a<00:00:47.160> photograph<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.090> video<00:00:48.570> when

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
triggers a photograph or video when

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.590 
triggers a photograph or video when
movement<00:00:49.470> happens<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.850> example<00:00:51.240> if<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.390> put

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
movement happens so for example if I put

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.570 
movement happens so for example if I put
this<00:00:51.720> somewhere<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.470> an<00:00:52.680> animal<00:00:53.010> walks<00:00:53.250> by<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
this somewhere and an animal walks by it

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.870 
this somewhere and an animal walks by it
will<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.330> a<00:00:54.360> photograph<00:00:54.630> or<00:00:54.990> take<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.200> video

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
will take a photograph or take a video

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.250 
will take a photograph or take a video
oftentimes<00:00:56.880> in<00:00:57.150> wildlife<00:00:57.510> management<00:00:57.570> we'll

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
oftentimes in wildlife management we'll

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.960 
oftentimes in wildlife management we'll
use<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.890> look<00:00:59.040> at<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.370> kind<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.610> animal

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
use this to look at some kind of animal

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.320 
use this to look at some kind of animal
behavior<00:01:00.350> for<00:01:01.350> example<00:01:01.830> this<00:01:02.580> year<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.060> Utah

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
behavior for example this year the Utah

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.960 
behavior for example this year the Utah
Division<00:01:03.540> of<00:01:03.840> Wildlife<00:01:03.960> Resources<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:05.040> using

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Division of Wildlife Resources is using

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
Division of Wildlife Resources is using
trail<00:01:06.270> cameras<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.960> monitor<00:01:07.409> some

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
trail cameras to monitor some

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.069 
trail cameras to monitor some
underpasses<00:01:08.340> under<00:01:09.179> a<00:01:09.210> highway<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.719> see<00:01:09.990> if

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
underpasses under a highway to see if

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.520 
underpasses under a highway to see if
mule<00:01:10.350> deer<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.829> use<00:01:11.009> that<00:01:11.659> well<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.259> reason

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
mule deer will use that well the reason

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.200 
mule deer will use that well the reason
I<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.249> Flaming<00:01:14.640> Gorge<00:01:14.670> is

I have you up here at Flaming Gorge is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.679 
I have you up here at Flaming Gorge is
because<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.460> trail<00:01:18.149> camera<00:01:18.539> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because I use this trail camera and

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
would monitor when the lion comes back

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.730 
would monitor when the lion comes back
to<00:01:35.429> feed<00:01:35.639> on<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.880> bighorn<00:01:36.240> sheep<00:01:36.530> how<00:01:37.530> did<00:01:37.679> I
