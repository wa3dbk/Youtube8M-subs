00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
basically what we're doing is we're

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
basically what we're doing is we're
enhancing<00:01:41.190> this<00:01:41.340> coating<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.030> we're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
enhancing this coating so we're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
enhancing this coating so we're
stripping<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.810> original<00:01:43.050> coating<00:01:43.800> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
stripping off the original coating and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.370 
stripping off the original coating and
we<00:01:44.940> had<00:01:45.090> some<00:01:45.270> engineers<00:01:45.690> come<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.200> test

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
we had some engineers come in and test

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.640 
we had some engineers come in and test
our<00:01:46.650> coating<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.400> actually<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.650> 40%

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
our coating and it's actually about 40%

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.950 
our coating and it's actually about 40%
strong<00:01:49.950> or<00:01:50.190> 40<00:01:50.580> times<00:01:50.610> stronger<00:01:51.270> than<00:01:51.450> apple's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
strong or 40 times stronger than apple's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.260 
strong or 40 times stronger than apple's
coating<00:01:52.410> so<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.920> actually<00:01:53.070> had<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.550> iPad<00:01:54.060> Mini

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
coating so we actually had a iPad Mini

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.020 
coating so we actually had a iPad Mini
get<00:01:54.450> dropped<00:01:54.780> after<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.619> colored<00:01:56.030> corner

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
get dropped after it was colored corner

process take like the average consumer
they<00:03:31.100> send<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:31.400> their<00:03:31.430> their<00:03:31.790> device<00:03:32.209> what<00:03:32.600> can

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
they send in their their device what can

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.910 
they send in their their device what can
they<00:03:32.810> expect<00:03:32.840> for<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.320> process<00:03:33.620> how<00:03:33.739> does<00:03:33.800> it

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
they expect for the process how does it

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.650 
they expect for the process how does it
go<00:03:34.010> down<00:03:34.160> from<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.790> time<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.150> get<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.450> we're

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
go down from the time we get it we're

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.570 
go down from the time we get it we're
estimating<00:03:35.870> about<00:03:36.560> 2<00:03:36.800> weeks<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.340> could<00:03:37.520> be

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
estimating about 2 weeks it could be

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.220 
estimating about 2 weeks it could be
sooner<00:03:38.090> but<00:03:38.300> that's<00:03:38.510> about<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.870> longest

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
sooner but that's about the longest

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.020 
sooner but that's about the longest
amount<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.560> time<00:03:39.650> you'd<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.100> waiting<00:03:40.250> from<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
amount of time you'd be waiting from the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.820 
amount of time you'd be waiting from the
time<00:03:41.239> we<00:03:41.570> receive<00:03:41.600> it<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.290> time<00:03:42.470> it's<00:03:42.650> back

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
time we receive it so the time it's back

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.620
