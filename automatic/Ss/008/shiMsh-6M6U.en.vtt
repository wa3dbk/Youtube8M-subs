00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.350 
turning that the tool
so<00:00:13.160> probably<00:00:13.490> every<00:00:13.700> bit<00:00:13.880> as<00:00:14.000> important<00:00:14.480> for

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
so probably every bit as important for

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.960 
so probably every bit as important for
how<00:00:16.110> you<00:00:16.170> stand<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:17.010> sharp<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.580> how

how you stand how sharp they are how
well<00:00:18.180> they<00:00:18.360> cut<00:00:18.630> there's<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.220> many<00:00:20.430> different

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
well they cut there's so many different

well they cut there's so many different
variations<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.720> kind<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.080> impossible<00:00:22.710> to

years its metal has a couple of set
screws<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.390> change<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
screws in it so you can change to

different<00:00:46.920> tooling<00:00:47.870> it's<00:00:48.870> okay

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
different tooling it's okay

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.280 
different tooling it's okay
round<00:00:50.130> I<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> shape<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
round I like the shape I don't like the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.940 
round I like the shape I don't like the
feel<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> plastic<00:00:53.310> too<00:00:53.550> particularly<00:00:54.000> much

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.139 

okay<00:00:58.950> this<00:00:59.130> is<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.310> tool<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> friend<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
okay this is a tool that a friend of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
okay this is a tool that a friend of
mine<00:01:00.360> made<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.870> me

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
mine made for me

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
mine made for me
way<00:01:02.520> fancier<00:01:03.000> than<00:01:03.149> anything<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:03.720> ever

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
way fancier than anything I would ever

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.749 
way fancier than anything I would ever
make<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.439> myself<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
make for myself again a little bit of

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.730 
make for myself again a little bit of
detail<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.149> it<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.840> knob<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> end<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
detail on it a little knob on the end I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.960 
detail on it a little knob on the end I
guess<00:01:07.920> that's<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> keep<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.399> hand<00:01:08.790> from

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
guess that's to keep your hand from

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.899 
guess that's to keep your hand from
slipping<00:01:09.270> off<00:01:10.040> again<00:01:11.040> fancier<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.700> would

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
slipping off again fancier and I would

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.889 
slipping off again fancier and I would
use<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.450> still<00:01:12.689> works<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
use but it still works this is one of

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.630 
use but it still works this is one of
the<00:01:16.020> earlier<00:01:16.439> handles<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.189> made<00:01:17.460> for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the earlier handles that I made for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.000 
the earlier handles that I made for
myself<00:01:17.820> again<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> prefer<00:01:18.990> buying<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.710> steel

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
myself again I prefer buying the steel

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.770 
myself again I prefer buying the steel
separately<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:20.940> putting<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.630> own

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
separately and then putting it in my own

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.830 
separately and then putting it in my own
handles<00:01:22.370> big<00:01:23.370> bulb<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> end<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.690> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
handles big bulb on the end which I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
handles big bulb on the end which I
don't<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.320> use<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> pretty<00:01:26.100> much<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> long

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
don't really use and pretty much a long

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.690 
don't really use and pretty much a long
shaft<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.810> works<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.860> plenty<00:01:29.190> of<00:01:29.340> handle

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
shaft it works you know plenty of handle

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.800 
shaft it works you know plenty of handle
there<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.150> leverage<00:01:32.299> this<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.510> scraper

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
there for leverage this is a scraper

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.620 
there for leverage this is a scraper
handle<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.500> made<00:01:34.790> if<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> notice<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.330> stripe

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
handle I made if you notice the stripe

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.380 
handle I made if you notice the stripe
in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> middle<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:38.130> stripe<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.880> actually

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
in the middle this stripe is actually

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050 
in the middle this stripe is actually
the<00:01:39.690> exact<00:01:40.020> same<00:01:40.260> thickness<00:01:40.619> as<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.549> middle

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the exact same thickness as the middle

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200 
the exact same thickness as the middle
up<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> basically<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.939> cut

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
up here so basically what I do is cut

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
up here so basically what I do is cut
this<00:01:45.510> cut<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> shape<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.920> tang<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.400> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this cut the shape for the tang on the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.929 
this cut the shape for the tang on the
tool<00:01:48.170> into<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:50.189> sandwich<00:01:50.760> it<00:01:50.909> between

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
tool into this then sandwich it between

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.929 
tool into this then sandwich it between
two<00:01:51.450> other<00:01:51.630> pieces<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.290> turn<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
two other pieces and turn it out so that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.770 
two other pieces and turn it out so that
gives<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.630> good<00:01:55.110> grip<00:01:55.729> good<00:01:56.729> fit<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.450> solid

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
gives it a good grip good fit good solid

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.690 
gives it a good grip good fit good solid
fit<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.049> there<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> come<00:01:58.920> loose

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.370 

this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.880> more<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.390> standard<00:02:03.960> handle

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
this is more of my standard handle

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
this is more of my standard handle
nowadays<00:02:04.880> pretty<00:02:05.880> much<00:02:06.150> just<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.479> straight

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
nowadays pretty much just a straight

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
nowadays pretty much just a straight
cylinder<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.350> found<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.280> need<00:02:08.459> two

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
cylinder I found out I don't need two

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.279 
cylinder I found out I don't need two
bumps<00:02:09.000> sometimes<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:09.689> grabbing<00:02:10.080> here

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
bumps sometimes I'm grabbing here

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.929 
bumps sometimes I'm grabbing here
sometimes<00:02:10.799> I'm<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.189> middle<00:02:11.370> sometimes

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
sometimes I'm in the middle sometimes

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.119 
sometimes I'm in the middle sometimes
I'm<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.420> handle<00:02:12.810> end<00:02:13.019> doesn't<00:02:13.860> really

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
I'm on the handle end doesn't really

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.479 
I'm on the handle end doesn't really
make<00:02:14.400> much<00:02:14.640> difference<00:02:16.010> they're<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.280> more

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
make much difference they're just more

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.039 
make much difference they're just more
comfortable<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:18.239> feels<00:02:18.450> good<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.870> me

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
comfortable that's what feels good to me

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.990 
comfortable that's what feels good to me
I<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:20.280> thought<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.489> sometime

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
I have actually thought of sometime

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.429 
I have actually thought of sometime
maybe<00:02:21.209> going<00:02:21.569> down<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.870> getting<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.200> sledge

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
maybe going down and getting a sledge

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.770 
maybe going down and getting a sledge
hammer<00:02:22.470> handle<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.610> cutting<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.599> into

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
hammer handle and cutting it into

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.270 
hammer handle and cutting it into
lengths<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.349> then<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> problem<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.099> have

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
lengths but then the problem you have

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.080 
lengths but then the problem you have
with<00:02:26.489> those<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:27.000> getting

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
with those is getting

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.869 
with those is getting
a<00:02:28.150> feral<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.140> some<00:02:29.680> sort<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.220> end<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.580> do

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
a feral of some sort on the end you do

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.540 
a feral of some sort on the end you do
need<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.390> here<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.890> stress<00:02:33.280> point

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
need this here this is a stress point

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.880 
need this here this is a stress point
the<00:02:34.180> fibers<00:02:34.599> can<00:02:34.840> split<00:02:35.260> especially<00:02:35.739> if<00:02:35.800> you

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the fibers can split especially if you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.380 
the fibers can split especially if you
have<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.099> catch<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.819> this<00:02:36.910> basically

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
have a catch and this basically

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.360 
have a catch and this basically
reinforces<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.500> Dave<00:02:38.739> Ellsworth<00:02:39.160> does<00:02:39.340> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
reinforces it Dave Ellsworth does a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.130 
reinforces it Dave Ellsworth does a
handle<00:02:39.730> which<00:02:39.849> he<00:02:39.940> turns<00:02:40.180> kind<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.660> eccentric

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
handle which he turns kind of eccentric

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.619 
handle which he turns kind of eccentric
like<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.010> sledgehammer<00:02:42.370> handle<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.420> he

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
like a sledgehammer handle and then he

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.920 
like a sledgehammer handle and then he
takes<00:02:43.870> some<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> colored<00:02:45.430> nylon<00:02:46.120> twine<00:02:46.540> or

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
takes some of the colored nylon twine or

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.229 
takes some of the colored nylon twine or
Dacron<00:02:47.440> twine<00:02:47.739> wraps<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:48.819> really

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
Dacron twine wraps it around really

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.729 
Dacron twine wraps it around really
tight<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.780> then<00:02:49.840> chases<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.500> with

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
tight and then chases that with

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.530 
tight and then chases that with
superglue<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:51.370> should<00:02:51.879> work<00:02:52.090> for<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.330> good

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
superglue which should work for a good

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.120 
superglue which should work for a good
ferrule<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.090> another<00:02:58.390> handle<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.950> one

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
ferrule this is another handle this one

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.440 
ferrule this is another handle this one
is<00:03:00.250> filled<00:03:00.519> with<00:03:00.670> lead<00:03:01.030> shot

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
is filled with lead shot

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.130 
is filled with lead shot
I<00:03:01.980> believe<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.130> material<00:03:03.579> is<00:03:03.730> aluminum<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
I believe the material is aluminum the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.050 
I believe the material is aluminum the
lead<00:03:05.349> shot<00:03:05.620> seems<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.099> be<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> new<00:03:06.459> popular

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
lead shot seems to be the new popular

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.819 
lead shot seems to be the new popular
thing<00:03:07.360> that's<00:03:07.569> coming<00:03:07.810> out<00:03:08.079> there<00:03:08.319> nowadays

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
thing that's coming out there nowadays

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.000 
thing that's coming out there nowadays
everybody<00:03:09.819> at<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> last<00:03:10.480> aw<00:03:11.170> symposium<00:03:11.980> that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
everybody at the last aw symposium that

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.490 
everybody at the last aw symposium that
I<00:03:12.130> went<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.670> was<00:03:12.760> making<00:03:13.230> modular<00:03:14.230> tool

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
I went to that was making modular tool

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.520 
I went to that was making modular tool
handles<00:03:15.040> had<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> little<00:03:16.060> screw<00:03:16.629> off<00:03:16.959> cap<00:03:17.290> on

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
handles had a little screw off cap on

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.839 
handles had a little screw off cap on
the<00:03:17.680> end<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.040> could<00:03:18.190> fill<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.489> with<00:03:18.610> lead

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
the end so you could fill it with lead

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.420 
the end so you could fill it with lead
shot<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:20.049> idea<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.920> makes<00:03:21.129> it<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.340> little

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
shot the idea is it makes it a little

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.530 
shot the idea is it makes it a little
bit<00:03:21.610> more<00:03:21.849> waiting<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.629> absorbs<00:03:23.170> vibration<00:03:24.010> I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
bit more waiting and absorbs vibration I

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.600 
bit more waiting and absorbs vibration I
don't<00:03:25.540> particularly<00:03:25.900> care<00:03:26.110> for<00:03:26.319> them<00:03:26.739> I'm

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
don't particularly care for them I'm

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.640 
don't particularly care for them I'm
generally<00:03:28.090> grabbing<00:03:28.480> higher<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.170> gout<00:03:29.349> so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
generally grabbing higher on the gout so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.099 
generally grabbing higher on the gout so
that's<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:30.160> counterweight<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.180> as<00:03:31.870> far<00:03:32.049> as

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
that's a counterweight and as far as

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.949 
that's a counterweight and as far as
dampening<00:03:32.650> vibration<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:34.120> closer<00:03:34.389> this<00:03:34.720> is

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
dampening vibration the closer this is

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.420 
dampening vibration the closer this is
to<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.319> wood<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.709> you're<00:03:35.829> cutting<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
to the wood that you're cutting on the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.039 
to the wood that you're cutting on the
tool<00:03:36.609> rest<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.239> less<00:03:37.389> vibration<00:03:37.989> you're

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
tool rest the less vibration you're

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.379 
tool rest the less vibration you're
going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.319> get<00:03:38.440> out<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.859> handle<00:03:39.280> end<00:03:39.459> but

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
going to get out on the handle end but

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.140 
going to get out on the handle end but
some<00:03:40.630> people<00:03:40.930> really<00:03:40.959> like<00:03:41.440> them<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.160> another

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
some people really like them and another

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.699 
some people really like them and another
thing<00:03:43.389> that's<00:03:43.510> coming<00:03:43.810> out<00:03:44.049> too<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.440> some<00:03:44.590> of

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
thing that's coming out too is some of

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.410 
thing that's coming out too is some of
the<00:03:44.799> foam<00:03:45.010> covered<00:03:45.430> handles<00:03:45.880> or<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.209> metal

the foam covered handles or the metal

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.300 
the foam covered handles or the metal
handles<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.079> they<00:03:47.230> have<00:03:47.410> collet<00:03:47.859> Chuck<00:03:47.889> sorry

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
handles is they have collet Chuck sorry
