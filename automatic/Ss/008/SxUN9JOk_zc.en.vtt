00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
twice in that area make sure you have

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
twice in that area make sure you have
all<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> fast<00:01:16.830> zombies<00:01:17.220> behind<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.670> then

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
all of the fast zombies behind you then

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.789 
all of the fast zombies behind you then
get<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.140> run<00:01:19.380> over<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
get out of there and I run over to this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
get out of there and I run over to this
empty<00:01:20.070> street<00:01:20.360> over<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> blast<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
empty street over here and blast the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
empty street over here and blast the
zombies<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.100> come<00:01:23.310> toward<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.729> you're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
zombies as they come toward you you're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.520 
zombies as they come toward you you're
probably<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.600> gonna<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> time<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> kill

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
probably not gonna have the time to kill

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.020 
probably not gonna have the time to kill
them<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.770> though<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.189> worry<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.580> okay

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
them all though don't worry that's okay

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
them all though don't worry that's okay
unless<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> ray<00:01:28.320> gun<00:01:28.500> or

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
unless you have like a ray gun or

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.929 
unless you have like a ray gun or
something<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> there

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
something you got to get out of there

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
something you got to get out of there
get<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> stairs<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:31.049> quick<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.500> get

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
get up the stairs really quick and get

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
get up the stairs really quick and get
ready<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> next<00:01:32.340> wave<00:01:32.520> before<00:01:33.299> they

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
ready for the next wave before they

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
ready for the next wave before they
start<00:01:33.689> spawning<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.710> repeat

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
start spawning and then you just repeat

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.260 
start spawning and then you just repeat
it<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> pretty<00:01:35.729> awesome<00:01:35.820> strategy

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it so it's a pretty awesome strategy

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640 
it so it's a pretty awesome strategy
I've<00:01:36.630> been<00:01:36.780> testing<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> couple<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
I've been testing it for a couple of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200 
I've been testing it for a couple of
days<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> works<00:01:38.549> fine<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.119> it's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
days and it works fine you know it's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.300 
days and it works fine you know it's
just<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.509> simple<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.500> could<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.040> here

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
just that simple you could see that here

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
just that simple you could see that here
I<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.820> jumping<00:01:42.329> over<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> lava<00:01:42.780> part

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I got the jumping over the lava part

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
I got the jumping over the lava part
down<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.590> character<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.280> barely

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
down in my character is actually barely

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
down in my character is actually barely
getting<00:01:45.240> hurt<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> way<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
getting hurt and this was not the way I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
getting hurt and this was not the way I
was<00:01:47.460> playing<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.000> map<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.360> first<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.720> thought

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
was playing this map at first I thought

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
was playing this map at first I thought
it<00:01:49.020> would<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.380> suicide<00:01:49.979> had<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.759> over

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it would be like suicide had to go over

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
it would be like suicide had to go over
here<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.450> such<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> close<00:01:52.079> quartered

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
here and like such a close quartered

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.649 
here and like such a close quartered
area<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:53.790> reason<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.240> works

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
area but for some reason it just works

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
area but for some reason it just works
so<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.229> me<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> favor<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.770> put<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> strategy

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so a do me a favor and put the strategy

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
so a do me a favor and put the strategy
