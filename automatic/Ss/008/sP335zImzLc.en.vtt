00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.000
 Now let's talk about one of the 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.370
 more important ways to save more 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.620
 fuel the way it does 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.250
 changes and the way you drive 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.130
 affect this saving at more rpm higher is 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.769
 the amount of fuel the rpm are 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.960
 so important that kamenz engines 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.449
 they have special functions so that their 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.570
 vehicle run at the best rpm 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.249
 possible to achieve maximum savings to 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.160
 the time it provides the power that 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.230
 you need when you need those 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.780
 functions include speed control 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.850
 according to the charge protection against 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.640
 reduction of gears and many more than 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.760
 we will explain later when it starts and 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.429
 accelerates carry enough rpm 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.980
 high so that when making changes 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.070
 the engine returns to gear to the level of 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.660
 correct rpm and can continue to increase 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.590
 the speed 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.790
 that is, do not take the rpm higher than 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.790
 that really should 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 it used to be true that the engines 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 they worked better at high rpm had that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.369
 raise the rpm to get the power 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.500
 of traction needed but today the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.110
 diesel engines, especially carmenes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 work with power at low rpm 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.390
 although current engines work at 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.090
 low rpm to save more fuel 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.649
 in certain handling conditions you can 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.890
 be necessary to reduce the speed 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.950
 when you need more power the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.350
 last engine and sx of camins grants a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.750
 Full maximum traction power of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.240
 1,000 rpm and the iese x12 of 1100 rpm 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.270
 you do not need to raise those rpm as 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.500
 before actually an engine walking by 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.170
 above 1650 rpm affects the savings 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.659
 of fuel the quicker you get 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.119
 to the highest gear and keep it better 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.710
 if you travel to the highest gear during 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.899
 only 75% 80% of the time and not the 90 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.819
 hundred loses three or four points 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.930
 percentage in savings 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.389
 would be 2400 or 3200 US dollars 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.280
 per year in fuel costs the 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.409
 experts calculate that the difference 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.980
 between efficient operators and 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.930
 less efficient is up to 30% in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.639
 the fuel savings 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.310
 if we talk about 80 thousand american dollars 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:32.219
 per year in fuel costs is 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.959
 a lot of money that's why they eat is recommended 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.510
 work with the factors under your 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.639
 control the docking space the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.769
 tire pressure techniques 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.870
 of gear shift idle time 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.870
 to make it as efficient as possible 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.870
 now of a knowledge evaluation 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.910
 How many rpm does the engine have more torque? 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:01.140
 Typical camins between 1150 and 1,600 rpm or 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.970
 between 1900 and 2300 rpm the engines 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.650
 current trucks produce a twist 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.860
 maximum well below 1,600 rpm 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.330
 usually at 1100 rpm for the iese and 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.240
 sm and up to 1600 for the usb it gets 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.780
 power economically at low rpm and 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.780
 saves fuel
