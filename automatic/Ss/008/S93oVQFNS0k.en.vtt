sesor Oni
rocket<00:00:14.389> engine<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:14.869> they're<00:00:15.110> really<00:00:15.529> easy<00:00:15.619> to

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
rocket engine and they're really easy to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.910 
rocket engine and they're really easy to
prep<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:17.240> first<00:00:17.449> thing<00:00:17.600> I<00:00:17.660> have<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:17.810> do<00:00:17.960> is<00:00:18.230> to

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
prep the first thing I have to do is to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.330 
prep the first thing I have to do is to
delay<00:00:19.220> drill<00:00:20.030> my<00:00:20.180> delay<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:20.990> this<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.830> 16

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
delay drill my delay and this is a 16

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.940 
delay drill my delay and this is a 16
second<00:00:22.790> motor<00:00:23.290> but<00:00:24.290> I'm<00:00:24.410> going<00:00:24.530> to<00:00:24.590> drill<00:00:24.830> it

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
second motor but I'm going to drill it

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.279 
second motor but I'm going to drill it
down<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.370> 13<00:00:25.820> seconds<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.539> 13<00:00:26.870> seconds

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
down to 13 seconds so it's a 13 seconds

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.300 
down to 13 seconds so it's a 13 seconds
long<00:00:27.530> and<00:00:28.340> this<00:00:28.580> is<00:00:28.789> their<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:30.619> delay

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
long and this is their the delay

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.549 
long and this is their the delay

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
motors and on the side over here you can

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.060 
motors and on the side over here you can
select<00:00:37.190> how<00:00:40.120> how<00:00:41.120> deep<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:41.510> want<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.750> go<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:43.040> I

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
select how how deep you want to go so I

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.590 
select how how deep you want to go so I
want<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.340> take<00:00:43.520> off<00:00:43.760> three<00:00:44.030> seconds<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:44.480> I'll

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
want to take off three seconds so I'll

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.650 
want to take off three seconds so I'll
just<00:00:44.780> dial<00:00:45.079> it<00:00:45.320> down<00:00:45.350> to<00:00:45.800> three<00:00:46.070> seconds<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:49.660> I

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
just dial it down to three seconds so I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.069 
just dial it down to three seconds so I
just<00:00:50.989> dial<00:00:51.260> it<00:00:51.440> down<00:00:51.470> lock<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.190> place<00:00:52.340> and

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
just dial it down lock it in place and

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:02.979 
just dial it down lock it in place and
then<00:00:54.079> I'll<00:00:54.530> drill<00:00:54.890> in<00:01:01.450> okay<00:01:02.450> so<00:01:02.510> there's<00:01:02.809> just

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
then I'll drill in okay so there's just

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.920 
then I'll drill in okay so there's just
a<00:01:03.110> very<00:01:03.230> small<00:01:03.649> hole<00:01:03.920> there<00:01:04.189> and<00:01:04.729> I'm<00:01:05.719> the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
a very small hole there and I'm the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.340 
a very small hole there and I'm the
instructions<00:01:06.500> they<00:01:06.710> say<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:11.509> drill<00:01:11.840> or<00:01:12.049> to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
instructions they say to to drill or to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.830 
instructions they say to to drill or to
go<00:01:13.039> around<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:13.490> an<00:01:13.609> exacto<00:01:14.090> knife<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.329> get<00:01:14.689> it

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
go around with an exacto knife to get it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.929 
go around with an exacto knife to get it
to<00:01:14.959> the<00:01:16.600> right<00:01:17.600> depth<00:01:18.109> I<00:01:21.340> had<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.459> tell<00:01:22.729> someone

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
we're at a real rocket launch so there's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.580 
we're at a real rocket launch so there's
a<00:01:28.880> lot<00:01:29.029> of<00:01:29.060> stuff<00:01:29.299> going<00:01:29.509> on<00:01:29.630> here<00:01:29.689> okay<00:01:30.380> then

a lot of stuff going on here okay then

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.589 
a lot of stuff going on here okay then
you<00:01:30.679> just<00:01:30.859> take<00:01:30.979> this<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.549> just<00:01:31.579> slide<00:01:32.359> it<00:01:32.479> in

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
you just take this and just slide it in

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:39.209 
you just take this and just slide it in
there<00:01:34.090> took<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.270> case<00:01:36.130> slide<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.310> through

there took the case slide it through
push<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.340> in<00:01:40.459> all<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.729> way<00:01:40.880> like<00:01:41.359> that<00:01:41.539> and<00:01:42.529> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
push it in all the way like that and the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.399 
push it in all the way like that and the
delay<00:01:43.009> will<00:01:43.189> stick<00:01:43.429> out<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.700> end<00:01:43.880> there<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
delay will stick out the end there and

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.239 
delay will stick out the end there and
then<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:46.209> set<00:01:47.209> down<00:01:47.709> and<00:01:48.709> my<00:01:48.919> rocket

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
then you just set down and my rocket

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.429 
then you just set down and my rocket
motor<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.579> prepped<00:01:52.450> okay<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.509> on<00:01:54.139> the<00:01:54.259> back

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
motor is prepped okay so on the back

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.050 
motor is prepped okay so on the back
here<00:01:54.679> we<00:01:54.829> have<00:01:54.859> our<00:01:57.459> engine<00:01:58.459> retainer<00:01:58.819> I'll

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
here we have our engine retainer I'll

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.339 
here we have our engine retainer I'll
just<00:01:59.179> take<00:01:59.359> that<00:01:59.389> off<00:01:59.659> I<00:01:59.840> don't<00:01:59.989> just<00:02:00.079> double

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
just take that off I don't just double

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
with the Indian retainer on and it's

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.890 
with the Indian retainer on and it's
ready<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.070> go<00:02:09.160> back<00:02:09.490> there<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:11.200> right<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:12.900> now

ready to go back there all right so now

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.800 
ready to go back there all right so now
I'll<00:02:14.230> move<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.590> out<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.890> way<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.340> okay

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I'll move this out of the way here okay

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:26.430 
I'll move this out of the way here okay
so<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:24.990> parachute<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.410> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
so this is the parachute this is a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.380 
so this is the parachute this is a
drogue<00:02:27.010> chute<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> small<00:02:27.910> one

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
drogue chute this is a small one

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.980 
drogue chute this is a small one
I<00:02:28.420> think<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.250> 18<00:02:30.250> inches<00:02:30.640> or<00:02:30.820> 24<00:02:31.090> inches<00:02:31.510> this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
I think it's 18 inches or 24 inches this

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.570 
I think it's 18 inches or 24 inches this
little<00:02:32.230> red<00:02:32.380> cap<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.830> hold<00:02:33.040> onto<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.340> just
