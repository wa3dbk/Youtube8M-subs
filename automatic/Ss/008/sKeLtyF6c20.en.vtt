00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
I'm fighting with my favorite tactic the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.160 
I'm fighting with my favorite tactic the
same<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.559> used<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:34.480> thee<00:00:34.660> total<00:00:35.020> realism<00:00:35.530> odd

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170

well<00:00:42.180> unless<00:00:51.000> special<00:00:52.710> curry<00:00:53.710> careful<00:00:54.280> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
well unless special curry careful I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.190 
well unless special curry careful I
experimented<00:00:57.010> with<00:00:57.250> this<00:00:58.000> tactic<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.690> lot<00:00:58.899> and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
experimented with this tactic a lot and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.360 
experimented with this tactic a lot and
it's<00:00:59.350> very<00:00:59.440> powerful<00:00:59.980> when<00:01:00.870> done<00:01:01.870> properly

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it's very powerful when done properly

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's very powerful when done properly
but<00:01:03.370> instead<00:01:04.270> of<00:01:04.570> having<00:01:04.830> cataphracts<00:01:05.860> or

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
but instead of having cataphracts or

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.219 
but instead of having cataphracts or
having<00:01:07.630> every<00:01:08.280> three<00:01:09.280> cavalry<00:01:09.700> can<00:01:10.300> be<00:01:10.450> very

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
having every three cavalry can be very

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.770 
having every three cavalry can be very
powerful<00:01:11.910> when

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:02:24.600 

in<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.080> video<00:01:17.320> my

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
well yeah they just charge right in the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.880

road<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.120> first

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
road and the first

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:55.190 
road and the first
yeah<00:02:33.010> I'd<00:02:34.010> simpler<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:35.330> space

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:20.750

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:26.469 
is no way for the leader to behave but

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:43.300 
is no way for the leader to behave but
in<00:03:26.530> battle<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.549> beyond<00:03:28.090> belief
