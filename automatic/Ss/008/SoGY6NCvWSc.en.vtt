00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.029 
with a quick video just talking about
golems<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.289> it's<00:00:16.500> happened<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:16.920> my

golems I know that it's happened in my

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.560 
golems I know that it's happened in my
attacks<00:00:17.400> I'm<00:00:17.640> sure<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.060> happened<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.449> you

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
attacks I'm sure it's happened in you

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.750 
attacks I'm sure it's happened in you
guys<00:00:18.810> attacks<00:00:19.199> where<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.859> drop<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> golem<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
guys attacks where you drop a golem and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.840 
guys attacks where you drop a golem and
you've<00:00:21.570> got<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.810> exposed<00:00:22.310> defense<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
you've got an exposed defense like this

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
you've got an exposed defense like this
but<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.390> want<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.720> drop<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.199> where<00:00:25.439> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but you want to drop it to where it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800 
but you want to drop it to where it
doesn't<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:27.180> far<00:00:27.420> away<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
doesn't go to there how far away can you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.689 
doesn't go to there how far away can you
drop<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> before<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> locks<00:00:28.769> onto<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.220> open

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
drop it before it locks onto that open

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.780 
drop it before it locks onto that open
defense<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.330> starts<00:00:30.810> rerouting<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:32.130> how<00:00:32.309> far

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
defense and starts rerouting or how far

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.830 
defense and starts rerouting or how far
away<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> drop<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.750> will

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
away do you have to drop it for it will

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
away do you have to drop it for it will
start<00:00:34.079> beating<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.590> wall<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.190> opposed<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
start beating on this wall as opposed to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
start beating on this wall as opposed to
go<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.870> thought<00:00:37.200> I'd<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> little

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
go in there so I thought I'd do a little

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
go in there so I thought I'd do a little
bit<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> testing<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.550> wish<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> did<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
bit of testing on it I wish I did and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.010 
bit of testing on it I wish I did and
it's<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.719> consistent<00:00:40.100> results<00:00:42.020> right

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it's pretty consistent results right

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.979 
it's pretty consistent results right
here<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:43.800> really<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.809> it's<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.930> like

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
here this is not really a it's not like

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.750 
here this is not really a it's not like
on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> multiplayer<00:00:46.950> map<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.640> can

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
on the multiplayer map where you can

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.400 
on the multiplayer map where you can
actually<00:00:48.300> count<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> tiles<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.260> can

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
actually count the tiles but we can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.439 
actually count the tiles but we can
pretty<00:00:49.559> much<00:00:49.649> still<00:00:49.950> count<00:00:50.190> them<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.449> right

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
pretty much still count them up right

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.569 
pretty much still count them up right
there<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.199> space<00:00:52.879> there<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.480> spaces

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
there is one space there is two spaces

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.439 
there is one space there is two spaces
three<00:00:56.930> four<00:00:58.100> five<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.550> then<00:00:59.609> right<00:01:00.000> here

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
three four five and then right here

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.549 
three four five and then right here
would<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.289> six<00:01:01.829> spaces<00:01:02.070> away<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> drop

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
would be six spaces away so if you drop

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
would be six spaces away so if you drop
what<00:01:04.799> I've<00:01:05.189> found<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> drop<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
what I've found is that if you drop a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810 
what I've found is that if you drop a
golem<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> drop<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
golem I'm going to drop it right here on

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.870 
golem I'm going to drop it right here on
the<00:01:09.060> corner<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.439> six<00:01:10.770> space<00:01:10.979> away<00:01:11.340> it's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the corner on that six space away it's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
the corner on that six space away it's
just<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> beat<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> wall<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just going to beat on that wall it's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.960 
just going to beat on that wall it's
going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> target<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.729> you're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
going to target that there but if you're

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.789 
going to target that there but if you're
within<00:01:15.270> five<00:01:15.659> spaces<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.500> drop<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
within five spaces so if we drop it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.920 
within five spaces so if we drop it
right<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.670> side<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
right there on that side it's going to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
right there on that side it's going to
the<00:01:19.140> defense<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.220> you're<00:01:20.340> scouting<00:01:20.610> your

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the defense so when you're scouting your

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
the defense so when you're scouting your
attack<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.780> sure<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.409> count<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.460> many

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
attack be sure you count up how many

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
attack be sure you count up how many
spaces<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> drop<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> six<00:01:24.750> phases<00:01:25.110> away

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
spaces if you drop it six phases away

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.039 
spaces if you drop it six phases away
six<00:01:26.070> tiles<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:27.030> good<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
six tiles you're good it's not going to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.870 
six tiles you're good it's not going to
reroute<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.650> exposed<00:01:29.009> defense<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
reroute to that exposed defense if you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
reroute to that exposed defense if you
drop<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.270> five<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:30.720> less<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.950> for

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
drop it five or less it is going for

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
drop it five or less it is going for
that<00:01:32.340> defense<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.720> remember<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> when

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that defense so just remember that when

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200 
that defense so just remember that when
you're<00:01:34.350> scouting<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.920> bases<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:36.000> other

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
you're scouting your bases out one other

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
you're scouting your bases out one other
thing<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> wanted<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> test<00:01:37.110> real<00:01:37.350> quickly<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
thing I wanted to test real quickly and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.499 
thing I wanted to test real quickly and
I<00:01:38.280> thought<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> was<00:01:38.850> pretty<00:01:39.060> consistent

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I thought that it was pretty consistent

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.219 
I thought that it was pretty consistent
as<00:01:39.930> far<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.290> results<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:43.049> what

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
as far as results as well is about what

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.679 
as far as results as well is about what
you<00:01:43.380> clear<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.770> junk<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> way

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
you clear all this junk out of the way

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
you clear all this junk out of the way
is<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.920> open<00:01:47.280> when<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> bust<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
is about when you open when you bust a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.210 
is about when you open when you bust a
wall<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.930> far<00:01:49.259> will<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.590> before<00:01:49.950> they

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
wall how far will they go before they

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.999 
wall how far will they go before they
reroute<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.930> did<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.530> gonna<00:01:52.649> drop

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
reroute so what I did was I'm gonna drop

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.530 
reroute so what I did was I'm gonna drop
wall<00:01:53.280> breakers<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.420> gonna

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
wall breakers right here so I'm gonna

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.050 
wall breakers right here so I'm gonna
count<00:01:54.780> spaces<00:01:55.259> away<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.700> one

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
count spaces away from that there's one

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:08.540 
count spaces away from that there's one
space<00:01:57.740> 2<00:01:58.740> space<00:01:58.770> 3<00:02:00.530> spaces<00:02:01.579> 4<00:02:02.899> 5<00:02:04.250> 6<00:02:05.299> 7<00:02:06.299> 8<00:02:07.550> spaces

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
right there and that's where I found the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.010 
right there and that's where I found the
limit<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> Golem<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.569> beating<00:02:12.930> on

limit if the if the Golem is beating on

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.370 
limit if the if the Golem is beating on
this

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380

wall<00:03:04.380> opens<00:03:04.740> up<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.100> bottom<00:03:05.400> one<00:03:05.520> will

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
wall opens up the bottom one will

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.430 
wall opens up the bottom one will
reroute<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.420> top<00:03:06.690> one's<00:03:06.900> gonna<00:03:07.050> stay<00:03:07.290> on

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
reroute the top one's gonna stay on

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.950 
reroute the top one's gonna stay on
there<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.920> could<00:03:08.220> be<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:09.570> know<00:03:09.660> when<00:03:09.930> I

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
there now it could be you know when I

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240 
there now it could be you know when I
did<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.230> practice<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.620> did<00:03:10.800> not<00:03:10.950> open<00:03:11.100> that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
did in practice I did not open that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.340 
did in practice I did not open that
biggest<00:03:11.700> section<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.120> walls<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.780> could<00:03:13.110> be

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
biggest section of walls it could be

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.230 
biggest section of walls it could be
that<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:13.890> actually<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.460> same<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.000> could<00:03:15.090> be

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
that it's actually the same it could be

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.150 
that it's actually the same it could be
five<00:03:15.480> spaces<00:03:15.990> from<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.530> corner<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
five spaces from that corner of the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.220 
five spaces from that corner of the
defense<00:03:17.580> or<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.330> could<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.600> from<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.780> opening

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
defense or it could be from the opening

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.590 
defense or it could be from the opening
it's<00:03:19.410> too<00:03:19.620> much<00:03:19.830> testing<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> really<00:03:20.550> know<00:03:20.730> but

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
it's too much testing to really know but

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.580 
it's too much testing to really know but
that's<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.960> to<00:03:22.020> give<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> real<00:03:22.560> good

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
that's going to give you a real good

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.190 
that's going to give you a real good
ballpark<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.520> where<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.000> need<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.300> be<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.690> far

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
ballpark of where you need to be as far

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.780 
ballpark of where you need to be as far
as<00:03:25.230> where<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.710> can<00:03:25.890> drop<00:03:26.100> your<00:03:26.280> golems<00:03:26.670> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
as where you can drop your golems and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.430 
as where you can drop your golems and
know<00:03:27.210> they're<00:03:27.390> gonna<00:03:27.480> reroute<00:03:27.960> or<00:03:28.320> they're

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
know they're gonna reroute or they're
