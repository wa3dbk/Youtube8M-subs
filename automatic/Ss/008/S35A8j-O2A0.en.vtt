up<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.790> Golden<00:02:18.240> Horn<00:02:19.130> when<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> Ottomans

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
up the Golden Horn when the Ottomans

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
up the Golden Horn when the Ottomans
invaded<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:22.040> 1453<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.790> removed<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.330> chain

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
invaded in 1453 they removed the chain

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.530 
invaded in 1453 they removed the chain
but<00:02:25.170> kept<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.770> standby<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
but kept it on standby and now the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
but kept it on standby and now the
Janissaries<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.560> raised<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.070> Ezio

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
Janissaries have raised it for Ezio

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.530 
Janissaries have raised it for Ezio
because<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:29.670> don't<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:29.970> his<00:02:30.090> ship<00:02:30.270> leaving

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
because they don't want his ship leaving

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.820 
because they don't want his ship leaving
so<00:02:30.960> it's<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.680> ironic<00:02:31.830> twist<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.380> Ezio

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
so it's a little ironic twist but Ezio

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.260 
so it's a little ironic twist but Ezio
has<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> way<00:02:35.160> around<00:02:35.250> that
