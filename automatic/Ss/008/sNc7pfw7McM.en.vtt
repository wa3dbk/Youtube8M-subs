that<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.069> how<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
that is how you do the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.460 
that is how you do the
an<00:02:12.550> easter<00:02:12.970> egg<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.690> second<00:02:14.080> map<00:02:14.230> of

an easter egg in the second map of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.590 
an easter egg in the second map of
zombies<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.250> pretty<00:02:15.880> insane<00:02:16.210> it's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
zombies it's pretty insane it's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.150 
zombies it's pretty insane it's
definitely<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.230> would<00:02:17.500> probably<00:02:17.680> say<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.100> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
definitely I would probably say it's a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
definitely I would probably say it's a
little<00:02:18.400> bit<00:02:18.490> easier<00:02:18.640> than<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> first<00:02:19.300> one

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
little bit easier than the first one

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.540 
little bit easier than the first one
that's<00:02:19.690> for<00:02:19.990> sure<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.710> I'd<00:02:20.830> say<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.280> still

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that's for sure but I'd say it's still

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.790 
that's for sure but I'd say it's still
pretty<00:02:21.760> complicated<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.050> enjoyed<00:02:23.440> kind<00:02:23.740> of
