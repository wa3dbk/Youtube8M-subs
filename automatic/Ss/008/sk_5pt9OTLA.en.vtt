00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.170 

this<00:00:33.899> assessment<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.739> examining<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> option

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this assessment is examining the option

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170 
this assessment is examining the option
the<00:00:36.329> proposed<00:00:36.660> action<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:38.030> restoring<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the proposed action of restoring the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.729 
the proposed action of restoring the
dune<00:00:39.420> using<00:00:39.989> sand<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.100> site<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
dune using sand that's on site there to

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
dune using sand that's on site there to
repair<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.949> dunes<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.910> has<00:00:45.059> been

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
repair the dunes where it has been

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.549 
repair the dunes where it has been
breached<00:00:45.830> and<00:00:47.930> give<00:00:48.930> us<00:00:49.080> some<00:00:49.260> time<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
breached and give us some time to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.790 
breached and give us some time to
examine<00:00:50.660> what<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.230> best<00:00:52.440> long-term

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
examine what would be the best long-term

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.240 
examine what would be the best long-term
course<00:00:53.400> of<00:00:53.579> action<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.960> unit<00:00:55.559> we're

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
course of action for the unit we're

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.619 
course of action for the unit we're
definitely<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> facing<00:00:57.390> some

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
definitely going to be facing some

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.119 
definitely going to be facing some
challenges<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.470> want<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.710> continue<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
challenges if we want to continue to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.180 
challenges if we want to continue to
manage<00:00:59.519> it<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.180> freshwater<00:01:00.659> marsh<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
manage it as a freshwater marsh and so

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.829 
manage it as a freshwater marsh and so
we<00:01:02.370> need<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> take<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> closer<00:01:03.299> look<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.720> that

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
we need to take a closer look at that

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.180 
we need to take a closer look at that
and<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.110> give<00:01:04.199> us<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.409> opportunity<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.979> put

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
and would give us an opportunity to put

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.100 
and would give us an opportunity to put
some<00:01:05.400> monitoring<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> place<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.659> gather<00:01:06.810> some

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
some monitoring in place and gather some

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810 
some monitoring in place and gather some
data<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.040> working<00:01:08.190> with<00:01:08.400> our<00:01:08.460> state

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
data and we're working with our state

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.750 
data and we're working with our state
partners<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.979> okay<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
partners on that okay here we are at the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
partners on that okay here we are at the
site<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.860> beach<00:01:14.119> reaches<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
site of where the beach reaches will be

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.700 
site of where the beach reaches will be
repaired<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.610> dune<00:01:17.880> line<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.439> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
repaired the dune line you can see is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
repaired the dune line you can see is
right<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.400> point<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> vegetated

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
right at that point where the vegetated

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.660 
right at that point where the vegetated
area<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:23.040> you're<00:01:23.189> looking<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
area is and then you're looking at the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
area is and then you're looking at the
world<00:01:23.850> war<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.330> tower<00:01:24.680> that<00:01:25.680> 20<00:01:26.189> years<00:01:26.369> ago

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
world war one tower that 20 years ago

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
world war one tower that 20 years ago
when<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> started<00:01:26.909> working<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> refuge

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
when I started working for the refuge

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
when I started working for the refuge
the<00:01:28.320> dune<00:01:28.530> line<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.040> front<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.430> tower

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the dune line was in front of that tower

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.870 
the dune line was in front of that tower
so<00:01:30.210> now<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.659> sitting<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.220> bay<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so now it's sitting in the bay so you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.989 
so now it's sitting in the bay so you
have<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.360> sense<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.039> incredible<00:01:35.729> rate

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
have a sense of what the incredible rate

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.060 
have a sense of what the incredible rate
of<00:01:36.240> erosion<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.590> it's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of erosion is going on here it's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.520 
of erosion is going on here it's
probably<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.789> than<00:01:38.999> 20<00:01:39.299> feet<00:01:39.329> per<00:01:40.229> year

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
probably more than 20 feet per year

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.099 
probably more than 20 feet per year
almost<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.999> short-term<00:01:42.509> action

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
almost this here is a short-term action

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.380 
almost this here is a short-term action
to<00:01:43.380> bridge<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> gap<00:01:43.979> between<00:01:44.179> from<00:01:45.179> now<00:01:45.359> until

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to bridge the gap between from now until

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.459 
to bridge the gap between from now until
the<00:01:45.780> completion<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.950> our<00:01:47.100> CCP<00:01:47.810> in<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> CCP

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
the completion of our CCP in the CCP

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.309 
the completion of our CCP in the CCP
we're<00:01:49.679> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.859> go<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.280> greater<00:01:50.310> detail

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
we're going to go in much greater detail

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.499 
we're going to go in much greater detail
and<00:01:52.319> do<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.469> much<00:01:52.679> greater<00:01:52.939> in-depth<00:01:53.939> analysis

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and do a much greater in-depth analysis

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
and do a much greater in-depth analysis
at<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.840> time<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.710> service<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.310> now<00:01:56.429> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
at that time the service right now is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
at that time the service right now is
trying<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.880> buy<00:01:56.999> some<00:01:57.060> time<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.950> can

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
trying to buy some time so that we can

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.609 
trying to buy some time so that we can
do<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.609> better<00:02:00.359> habitat<00:02:00.990> long-term

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
do some better habitat long-term

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.270 
do some better habitat long-term
management<00:02:01.950> planning<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.990> also<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.280> just

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
management planning and also to just

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
management planning and also to just
sort<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.609> maintain<00:02:06.389> a<00:02:06.450> short-term<00:02:07.380> status<00:02:07.920> quo

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
sort of maintain a short-term status quo

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.760 
sort of maintain a short-term status quo
to<00:02:08.819> give<00:02:08.970> us<00:02:09.090> time<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> establish<00:02:09.770> exactly

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to give us time to establish exactly

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.250 
to give us time to establish exactly
what<00:02:11.460> our<00:02:11.490> habitat<00:02:12.300> management<00:02:12.510> directions

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
what our habitat management directions

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.680 
what our habitat management directions
going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.890> our<00:02:14.100> CCP<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> next<00:02:15.300> 15

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
going to be in our CCP for the next 15

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.140

years well public safety is always a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.210 
years well public safety is always a
priority<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> concern<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.560> us

so we want to make sure we're always

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.680 
so we want to make sure we're always
taking<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.160> into<00:02:23.370> consideration<00:02:23.540> first<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
taking that into consideration first it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.980 
taking that into consideration first it
should<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.900> noted<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.440> roads<00:02:25.650> are

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
should be noted that the roads are

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.140 
should be noted that the roads are
approximately<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> half<00:02:29.790> feet

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
