00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
simply what spot reduction implies is

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.010 
simply what spot reduction implies is
that<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:23.979> is<00:01:24.070> possible<00:01:24.369> for<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.179> burn<00:01:25.630> fat

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
that it is possible for you to burn fat

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.919 
that it is possible for you to burn fat
from<00:01:26.560> specific<00:01:27.310> areas<00:01:27.789> of<00:01:27.940> your<00:01:28.179> body<00:01:28.420> by

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
from specific areas of your body by

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.109 
from specific areas of your body by
training<00:01:29.319> those<00:01:29.649> specific<00:01:30.280> areas<00:01:30.459> with

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
resistance for example spot reduction

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.059 
resistance for example spot reduction
would<00:01:34.060> imply<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.660> performing<00:01:35.170> bicep<00:01:35.679> curls

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
would imply that performing bicep curls

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.160 
would imply that performing bicep curls
is<00:01:36.369> going<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.670> burn<00:01:36.849> fat<00:01:37.149> off<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.450> your<00:01:37.690> bicep

is going to burn fat off of your bicep
area<00:01:38.410> or<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.130> performing<00:01:39.700> leg<00:01:40.239> curls<00:01:40.660> is

area or that performing leg curls is
going<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.319> burn<00:01:41.530> fat<00:01:41.800> off<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.160> your<00:01:42.250> hamstring

going to burn fat off of your hamstring

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.510 
going to burn fat off of your hamstring
area<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:44.020> truth<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.800> notion<00:01:45.190> of
