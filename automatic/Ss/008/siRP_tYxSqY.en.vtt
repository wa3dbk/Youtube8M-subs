00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.920
 the agricultural production of the country is very 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.660
 important for our economy and the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 section of products of plant origin 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.789
 fresh and processed service 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 national agricultural health service is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.660
 the obligation to verify 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 necessary hygienic conditions 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.490
 same as transmitted diseases 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 for food are an important 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.340
 burden for health 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.290
 in this context operates the policies and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 activities pursued by the division of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.820
 good food safety 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.130
 agricultural and manufacturing practices 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 terms that are now globally 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.160
 known oriented to take care of the health 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.600
 human 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.510
 and the national health service 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.570
 agriculture and numerous objectives and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.670
 its function is precisely to ensure the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.180
 quality innocuousness of the products of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.080
 there the importance that we have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 increased inspection request 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.260
 in plants of vegetable processes 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.780
 and also of fruit trees with the objective 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.080
 essential to be able to guarantee 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.060
 production can guarantee the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.040
 certification of products and power 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.560
 also achieve the visibility of these 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.450
 products we walk markets and guarantee 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.479
 The sustainability of the markets is 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.550
 very important the senasa covers all the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.399
 food chain from production 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.710
 to consumption providing inspection to 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.869
 registered plants themselves that are 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.090
 certified to send your product to 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.240
 other markets like the united states and 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 europe generating an estimated 650 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.289
 millions of dollars in foreign currency 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.829
 and SENASA has an important role in the 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.840
 certification process really 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.579
 inspectors what they do is a process 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.530
 check 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.659
 within this verification there is a 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.990
 compliance with established rules 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.909
 for the production of healthy foods and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.160
 from there it emerges precisely 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.619
 then the issue of that nathan can 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.709
 provide guarantees that is the subject of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.170
 certification can testify that the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.930
 producers truly fulfills that the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.880
 packers comply with ppm which are the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.160
 systems that guarantee the safety of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 food and that is access to 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.099
 markets that what they really do is 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.799
 that they can access markets and have a 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.500
 greater economic value by having a 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.810
 better profitability 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.910
 the same commitment is part of the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.040
 private sector with compliance with 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.170
 Regulation for the inspection and 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.260
 safety of fresh fruits and vegetables 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.170
 and processed based on the regulations 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.390
 international as is the case with the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.209
 packing plant agricultural engineering 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.670
 and livestock this year has more than 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.250
 eight years under the inspection of senasa 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.250
 export their products to the US market 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.100
 check record 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.940
 all the activities that we 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.330
 we perform daily from monitoring 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.100
 in the greenhouses the output of the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.470
 fruit to the greenhouses the reception of 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.270
 that fruit inside the infection account 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.830
 to approximately 5% of everything so that 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.330
 enter the packaging process and they 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.610
 certify that the plants are 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.730
 working on time and in form for the 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.500
 Export without a certificate 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.790
 and without the help they already give us 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.790
 we could not be 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.750
 within the functions of the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.990
 inspectors of senasa is monitoring 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.590
 the greenhouses the exit and reflection 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.599
 of the fruit 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.790
 certification of fruits and 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.219
 Vegetables in the plant 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.879
 the personal hygiene of each of the 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.879
 workers 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.750
 ah 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.389
 in the case of water treatment 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:13.260
 verify the proper concentrations 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:16.150
 of disinfectants lubricants 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.489
 used within the plant should be 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.370
 of food grade and be previously 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.990
 authorized the management program and 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 pest control should encompass 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.289
 control strategies said program is 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.599
 also mandatory 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.000
 verify that the product is placed 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.949
 directly on pallets which 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.889
 they must be in adequate conditions 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.860
 for that purpose never in direct contact 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.000
 with the floor they should also have a 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.000
 metal detector 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.680
 in the variety range of plants 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.470
 processors is the packaging of 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.590
 Vegetable has verify every process 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.590
 of 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.780
 we have the whole batch in vinegar true 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.600
 this is my lot is product has 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.449
 true meaning leads to a certain a 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.100
 pretty written process 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.520
 the elaboration 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.920
 the packaging if they see how thorough it is and 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.980
 at the same time that is a control of but is 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.890
 always of temperature 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.020
 they have to carry we also have 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.940
 one of the most industrialized plants 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.550
 at the Central American level of chilies 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.620
 jalapeños who are certified with 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.620
 the hashtag plan for its acronym in English 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.540
 and quality management systems with 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.330
 an export of 10 million pounds 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.340
 annual with safety standards and 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.830
 quality for the consumer 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.180
 We have very trained staff that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.919
 we work with producers 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.199
 independent I know all over the country 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.990
 hammond the certification process of 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.970
 good agricultural practices and we have 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.710
 enough support from the government 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.419
 with the question of what we have 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.090
 an audit per year that we have 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.700
 come out very well and we have several do 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.700
 several applications that we elaborate 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.160
 We are generating 650 jobs at the moment 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.770
 direct indirect effects on the part of 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.060
 the producers like about 2,500 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.100
 jobs 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.070
 another of the activities of the companies 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.290
 dedicated to this area is the export 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.139
 of jalapeño chile stuffed who 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.360
 they have the technology conditions 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.800
 environmental and climatic in their areas of 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.840
 good production we have to 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.120
 All our raw material comes from 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.150
 the part of san marcos de colón and in the 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.639
 northern part we show the whole jalapeño 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.040
 where we enter our plant where 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.190
 we process it according to such book these 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.139
 orchards and go from a time of 6 to 15 days 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.300
 they are processed stuffed with cheese 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.919
 we want to take depending on the 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.160
 specification and our orders 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.610
 client is born from the regulatory member of 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.800
 Honduras hardly needs a week in 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.050
 where we make infections and we do 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.150
 external audits and they 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.620
 they are constantly in communication with 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.560
 a person 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.760
