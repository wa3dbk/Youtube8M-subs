00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
start off here is the silicon it's a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
shell by the way the silicone goes in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
shell by the way the silicone goes in
the<00:00:40.110> inside<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.100> outer<00:00:41.340> shell<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:45.079> inner

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the inside of the outer shell the inner

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.650 
the inside of the outer shell the inner
shell<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.219> flimsy<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.420> i<00:00:48.480> don't

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
shell is very flimsy that's what i don't

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.580 
shell is very flimsy that's what i don't
like<00:00:48.719> about<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:50.000> I<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.960> gonna<00:00:52.170> squish<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> a

speakers<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.720> says<00:02:21.959> incipio

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
speakers now here it says incipio

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.119 
speakers now here it says incipio
bulging<00:02:25.260> out<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.870> right<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.260> I'd<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:29.099> a

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
bulging out so right here I'd have a

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.190 
bulging out so right here I'd have a
little<00:02:29.280> bit<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.730> trouble<00:02:30.830> sliding<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
little bit of trouble sliding it in the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.059 
little bit of trouble sliding it in the
case<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.739> slides<00:02:35.580> in<00:02:36.410> just<00:02:37.410> again<00:02:37.739> make<00:02:38.040> sure

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
case just slides in just again make sure

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.420 
case just slides in just again make sure
that<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.670> silicon<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.360> not<00:02:39.540> creased<00:02:42.980> ok<00:02:44.000> so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
that the silicon is not creased ok so

00:02:46.430 --> 00:03:02.090 
that the silicon is not creased ok so
just<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> fix<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.269> up<00:02:51.349> one<00:02:52.349> second

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.130 

so<00:03:02.790> by<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.000> way<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.510> go<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:05.220> incipio

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
so by the way you can go to go incipio

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.120 
so by the way you can go to go incipio
com<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.770> get<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.070> case<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:10.440> website<00:03:10.860> will<00:03:10.980> be

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
com to get this case the website will be

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.130 
com to get this case the website will be
in<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.520> description<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.630> will<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.900> on

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
in the description and it will be on

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.860 
in the description and it will be on
screen<00:03:13.560> too<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.100> believe<00:03:14.280> not<00:03:15.270> it's<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
screen too I believe not it's in the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.160 
screen too I believe not it's in the
description<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:18.390> again<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.900> called<00:03:19.110> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
description so again this is called the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.230 
description so again this is called the
double<00:03:19.590> cover<00:03:19.890> case<00:03:20.160> comes<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:20.790> three

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
double cover case comes in three

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.530 
double cover case comes in three
different<00:03:21.270> colors<00:03:21.570> i<00:03:22.050> believe<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.390> here<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.480> is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
different colors i believe so here it is

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.630 
different colors i believe so here it is
