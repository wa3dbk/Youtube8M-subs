00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 and especially consumptions clearly 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 least the c4 join the downsizing the

 elite 2 and the ford focus ecoboost with 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.190
 his little 1 liter of 125 horses 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.390
 no doubt this is the current trend 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 inside nothing indicates what 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.360
 motorization this is our model 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 test in high-end finish 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 exclusive is entitled to leather seats 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 electric and massaging in the front the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.719
 quality of presentation is remarkable 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 for the category the dashboard 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 being shared with the ds4 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 in the back we find a bank is 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 quite comfortable and leg room 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.210
 enough for two adults 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.190
 despite a livability lower than the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
 average of the category the safe in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.800
 revenge is very generous with more than 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.880
 400 of the six cubic meters 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.900
 one of the best volumes in the segment 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.280
 contacted from the start we recognize 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 the typical sound and three engines 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.979
 cylinders the condition however of 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.470
 stretch your ear because the soundproofing 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 is quite correct the epate engine 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.799
 by his very generous couple seen the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 cubic capacity is available very early 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.340
 blow times are easy despite a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.630
 box staging a little long the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.369
 performance is progressing compared 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
 for is it vti and well in tone 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.479
 face the Megane and Focus rival puts c4

 everyone agrees with comfort 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.720
 above the lot even though our version 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.400
 fitted with 18-inch wheels became 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.990
 more impactful the 18-inch wheels 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.549
 are another disadvantage they make 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.869
 seriously mounted to the consumer by 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.009
 compared with the same car shod 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.869
 standard 16-inch wheels 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.000
 the gap is much larger than the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.170
 deciliter announced by citroÃ«n 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.700
 in any case you will indeed 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.680
 a compact pleasant to drive and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.479
 reasonable in consumption this new 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.399
 rally two hits and hp escapes the penalty 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.860
 ecological whose c4 1 mitis vti 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.689
 was suffering the innovative small and hp 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.280
 indicates in passing the presence of a stop 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.180
 and start different technically from 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 that of 10 h 10 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.590
 but also very successful
