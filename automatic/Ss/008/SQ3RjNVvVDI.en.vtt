going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.850> turn<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.300> this<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:50.100> everything

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
going to turn it this way so everything

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.810 
going to turn it this way so everything
lays<00:01:50.850> down<00:01:51.150> like<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:52.430> all<00:01:53.430> right

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
lays down like that all right

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.230 
lays down like that all right
try<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.330> make<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.900> nice<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.080> even<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.210> way

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.150 
try to make it nice and even all the way
around<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.860> another

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
around and I'm going to get another

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.609 
around and I'm going to get another
piece<00:02:03.140> or<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.410> more<00:02:04.560> hot<00:02:04.770> glue<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:06.470> put<00:02:07.470> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
piece or some more hot glue and put that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.040 
piece or some more hot glue and put that
around<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.340> again<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.670> am<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.390> once

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
around here again and I am going to once

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.580 
around here again and I am going to once
again<00:02:14.180> wrap<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.330> around<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.470> we

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
again wrap it around so this is what we

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.860 
again wrap it around so this is what we
had<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.010> far<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.880> I'm<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.150> quite<00:02:21.420> happy<00:02:21.750> with

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
had so far but I'm not quite happy with

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.850 
had so far but I'm not quite happy with
it<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.140> think<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.380> needs<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> little

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it I think it needs to be a little

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.979 
it I think it needs to be a little
fuller<00:02:23.070> I'm<00:02:24.000> getting<00:02:24.239> some<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.480> yarn<00:02:24.600> that

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
fuller I'm getting some more yarn that

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.500 
fuller I'm getting some more yarn that
I've<00:02:25.140> wound<00:02:25.350> around<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.650> hand<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.209> I'm<00:02:27.209> going

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
I've wound around my hand and I'm going

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.740 
I've wound around my hand and I'm going
to<00:02:27.540> just<00:02:27.750> glue<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.880> all<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> bottom

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
to just glue it all on to the bottom
