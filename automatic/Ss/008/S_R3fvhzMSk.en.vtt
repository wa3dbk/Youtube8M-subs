00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.790

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.210
 do not know absolutely 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.919
 what do you know about recipes 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.720
 know the recipe that's what we 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.029
 interested we will start everything 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.020
 simply not going back up a thing that is 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.020
 close to a mayonnaise 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:40.450
 we leave with the areas of mustard 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.210
 in weird yeah it's a beautiful 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.650

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.930
 dijon mustard it's perfect ok 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.570
 Okay 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.360
 we 'll start to season 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.790
 involved in this scene you want to 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.530
 pepper is enough to squeeze you well 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:03.460
 seasoned we will put the mayonnaise 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:05.350
 very slowly I prepare the shallots 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.679
 so I'm doing this with a knife but we 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.939
 can do that quite a mixer 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.469
 so you're going to blender the house that 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.740
 us in cats the other not hesitate 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.590
 not 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.270
 the mayonnaise this mini kids is ready and 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.049
 the walk all three go mix 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.740
 exactly we put that here yeah we go 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:29.069
 to start 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:32.049
 so I entrusted with gray shallots 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:35.219
 must create taste is the importance it 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.560
 is super well done in game h 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.090
 chive parsley dish that's it that's it 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.679
 it's really classic bows getting 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.509
 do the lawyers are entitled to put 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.069
 a little tarragon a little bit of discount 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:51.399
 will be greedy I like to put 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:52.479
 coriander and the stuff too good 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.889
 in your recipe I think it's 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.009
 cases for which you leave whole 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:59.829
 because on such names the names 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.360
 these are the highest quality 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:09.190
 little of the little ones says that after 4 in May 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.290

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.010
 in the unpronounceable name so you will us 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.580
 to make a joy I say there I think 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.240
 they know it's leicester sauce 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.140
