00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.959
 what damage certainly remarkable 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.150
 advantages that it possesses but a cause the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.950
 gamer like me try too much 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.769
 gameplay unbalance like others

 free games can bring like 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.160
 final vote I can give a full 8 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.470
 the complex is in fact a 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.030
 very nice game that sees continuous 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.850
 innovations and provided with continuos 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.590
 batch the various technological lines in 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.000
 they want a continuous search for new ones 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.010
 battles new experiences 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.680
 I cannot, however, appreciate the style 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.080
 clashes as they have been 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.300
 produced nor game mode with time 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.190
 the repetitiveness of the game itself and the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:44.120
 slowness of certain battles can lead 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:45.650
 to a bunch of boredom and back guys 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.170

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.250

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.630
