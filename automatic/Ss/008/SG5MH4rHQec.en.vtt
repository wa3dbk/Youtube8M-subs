the<00:01:54.630> back<00:01:54.810> I've<00:01:55.140> got<00:01:55.170> some<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the back I've got some of them that I

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
the back I've got some of them that I
had<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.850> know<00:01:56.969> through<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> sides<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
had up you know through the sides of it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.940 
had up you know through the sides of it
it's<00:01:58.259> pretty<00:01:58.409> crude<00:02:00.259> some<00:02:01.259> um<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.530> still<00:02:01.770> add<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it's pretty crude some um I still add a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
it's pretty crude some um I still add a
little<00:02:02.159> weight<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> hook<00:02:03.469> but<00:02:04.469> because

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
little weight to the hook but because

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.340 
little weight to the hook but because
it's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> big<00:02:05.280> wood<00:02:05.549> bait<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:06.869> know<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.049> can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it's a big wood bait you know you can

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
it's a big wood bait you know you can
modify<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> lot<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.610> different<00:02:08.879> ways<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
modify it in a lot of different ways you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.150 
modify it in a lot of different ways you
know<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.379> when<00:02:10.590> I've<00:02:10.709> got<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> weight

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
know like that when I've got the weight

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.580 
know like that when I've got the weight
back<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> back<00:02:12.060> end

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
back there on the back end

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.260 
back there on the back end
you<00:02:12.980> know<00:02:13.069> because<00:02:13.370> maybe<00:02:13.610> when<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.849> put<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.180> in

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
you know because maybe when I put it in

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.880 
you know because maybe when I put it in
the<00:02:14.330> water<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:15.349> it's<00:02:15.560> floating<00:02:15.860> a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the water you know it's floating a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.350 
the water you know it's floating a
little<00:02:15.950> bit<00:02:16.250> too<00:02:16.430> much<00:02:16.580> head<00:02:16.849> down<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.330> I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
little bit too much head down so I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.690 
little bit too much head down so I
wanted<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.840> float<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.410> know<00:02:18.530> more<00:02:18.739> level<00:02:19.130> in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
wanted to float you know more level in

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.380 
wanted to float you know more level in
the<00:02:19.849> water<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.590> yeah<00:02:22.550> we<00:02:22.730> modified<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.270> lot

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the water so yeah we modified in a lot

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.490 
the water so yeah we modified in a lot
of<00:02:23.420> different<00:02:23.569> ways<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> lot<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.230> different

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
of different ways a lot of different

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.280 
of different ways a lot of different
colors<00:02:25.090> there's<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.180> little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.110> weight<00:02:27.260> in

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
colors there's a little bit of weight in

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.339 
colors there's a little bit of weight in
the<00:02:27.440> belly<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.069> one<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.900> know<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.019> kind

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
the belly of that one you know just kind

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.720 
the belly of that one you know just kind
of<00:02:30.380> depends<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.769> what<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.950> want<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.400> do

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
of depends on what I want it to do

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.979 
of depends on what I want it to do
you<00:02:31.849> know<00:02:31.940> sometimes<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.510> learnt<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.810> float

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
you know sometimes I learnt to float

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.390 
you know sometimes I learnt to float
head<00:02:33.170> down<00:02:33.349> sometimes<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.890> want<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.220> float

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
head down sometimes I want it to float

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.449 
head down sometimes I want it to float
real<00:02:34.610> level<00:02:35.530> but<00:02:36.530> like<00:02:36.680> say<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.370> a

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
real level but like say because it's a

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.400 
real level but like say because it's a
wood<00:02:37.640> bait<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.269> actually<00:02:38.480> manipulate<00:02:38.959> it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
wood bait you can actually manipulate it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.380 
wood bait you can actually manipulate it
and<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.099> there's<00:02:40.370> weights<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.180> back

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
and you know there's weights in the back

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.890 
and you know there's weights in the back
of<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:41.750> one<00:02:41.900> there<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.970> know<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.150> can<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
of that one there you know you can you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.150 
of that one there you know you can you
can<00:02:44.930> weight<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.410> lot<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.620> different<00:02:45.890> ways<00:02:46.010> to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
can weight it a lot of different ways to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.280 
can weight it a lot of different ways to
make<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.519> what<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.700> want<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.120> do<00:02:47.290> it's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
make it do what you want it to do it's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.490 
make it do what you want it to do it's
easier<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.650> work<00:02:48.799> with<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.220> plastic<00:02:49.640> bait

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
easier to work with in a plastic bait

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.720 
easier to work with in a plastic bait
and<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.560> think<00:02:51.769> that's<00:02:51.950> probably<00:02:52.130> why<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.459> throw

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
and I think that's probably why I throw

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.770 
and I think that's probably why I throw
it<00:02:52.819> it's<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.090> big<00:02:53.360> wooden<00:02:54.049> bait<00:02:54.380> like<00:02:55.160> say<00:02:55.400> and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
it it's a big wooden bait like say and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.610 
it it's a big wooden bait like say and
it's<00:02:56.780> easier<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.260> mess<00:02:57.680> with<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.130> manipulate
