have it now and you can you home ologist
a<00:00:52.050> recovery<00:00:52.620> combine<00:00:52.890> into<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.280> oh<00:00:53.430> yeah

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a recovery combine into them oh yeah

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
a recovery combine into them oh yeah
every<00:00:53.969> region<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:55.079> medical<00:00:55.379> benefits<00:00:55.829> are

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
every region the medical benefits are

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 
every region the medical benefits are
enormous<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.879> they're<00:00:57.149> enormous<00:00:57.660> really

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
enormous and they're enormous really

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
enormous and they're enormous really
because<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.039> allows<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.809> detailed

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
because it allows a detailed

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
because it allows a detailed
understanding<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.250> function<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
understanding of the function of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.359 
understanding of the function of
genetics<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.750> talking<00:01:04.140> about<00:01:04.309> looking<00:01:05.309> at

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
genetics I'm talking about looking at

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
genetics I'm talking about looking at
the<00:01:05.430> function<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.909> mice<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.200> human

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the function in mice but the human

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
the function in mice but the human
genome<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> human<00:01:08.880> genes<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.299> very

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
genome and the human genes are very

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
genome and the human genes are very
similar<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.010> therefore<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.760> infer

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
similar and so therefore we can infer

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
similar and so therefore we can infer
what<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> gene<00:01:13.020> does<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> human

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
what the gene does in the human

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.429 
what the gene does in the human
situation<00:01:14.689> from<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.960> doing<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
situation from what it's doing in the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.420 
situation from what it's doing in the
mouse<00:01:17.000> I'm<00:01:18.000> absolutely<00:01:18.509> delighted<00:01:18.810> myself<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
mouse I'm absolutely delighted myself to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
mouse I'm absolutely delighted myself to
receive<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> Nobel<00:01:21.210> Prize<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.900> also

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
receive the Nobel Prize but I'm also

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.060

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
top university with top students you

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.330 
top university with top students you
have<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.600> well<00:02:14.290> up<00:02:14.440> there<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.890> research<00:02:15.280> and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
have to be well up there in research and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.199 
have to be well up there in research and
I'm<00:02:15.459> glad<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.819> see<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.330> are<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:17.040> paper<00:02:18.040> oh<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.150> do

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
I'm glad to see we are I paper oh so do

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.640 
I'm glad to see we are I paper oh so do
the<00:02:19.450> study<00:02:19.660> how<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.870> getting<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.200> people

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
the study how you getting on people

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.680 
the study how you getting on people
often<00:02:21.040> ask<00:02:21.390> me<00:02:22.860> about<00:02:24.180> why<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.390> should<00:02:25.600> be

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
often ask me about why we should be

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.210 
often ask me about why we should be
doing<00:02:26.130> fundamental<00:02:27.130> research<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:30.069> is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
doing fundamental research now this is

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
doing fundamental research now this is
really<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.610> very<00:02:30.640> difficult<00:02:31.000> question<00:02:31.239> in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
really a very difficult question in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.360 
really a very difficult question in
biology<00:02:31.989> because<00:02:32.380> there<00:02:32.680> are<00:02:32.860> practical

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
biology because there are practical

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.670 
biology because there are practical
outcomes<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.750> look<00:02:35.200> at<00:02:35.319> astronomy

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
outcomes but if you look at astronomy

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.070 
outcomes but if you look at astronomy
for<00:02:36.069> instance<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.730> astronomers<00:02:37.660> are<00:02:37.780> looking

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
for instance the astronomers are looking

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.810 
for instance the astronomers are looking
to<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> stars<00:02:38.620> they're<00:02:39.040> finding<00:02:39.280> wonderful

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
to the stars they're finding wonderful

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.790 
to the stars they're finding wonderful
things<00:02:40.030> about<00:02:40.150> them<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.810> we're<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.769> very

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
things about them and we're all very

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.160 
things about them and we're all very
interested<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.820> outcome<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.660> our

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
interested in the outcome this is our

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.280 
interested in the outcome this is our
universe<00:02:44.769> we're<00:02:45.010> living<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:45.870> we<00:02:46.870> live<00:02:47.080> on

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
universe we're living in now we live on

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.620 
universe we're living in now we live on
this<00:02:47.650> world<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.340> biological<00:02:48.550> universe<00:02:49.390> and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
this world in a biological universe and

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.050 
this world in a biological universe and
our<00:02:49.810> internal<00:02:50.500> stars<00:02:50.830> need<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.670> studied<00:02:52.030> in

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
our internal stars need to be studied in

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.290 
our internal stars need to be studied in
just<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.510> same<00:02:52.540> way<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.760> what<00:02:55.120> this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
just the same way and really what this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.949 
just the same way and really what this
is<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.780> an<00:02:56.940> intellectual<00:02:57.940> approach<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.930> our

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
is is an intellectual approach to our

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.660 
is is an intellectual approach to our
full<00:02:59.530> understanding<00:02:59.830> of<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> biological

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
full understanding of the biological

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.050 
full understanding of the biological
world<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.510> which<00:03:01.630> we<00:03:01.690> live
