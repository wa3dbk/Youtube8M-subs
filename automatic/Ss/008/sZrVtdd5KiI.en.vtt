00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 hello welcome to the next video we 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.470
 let predecessor against neighbors today 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289
 compete 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 In the fall samsung galaxy ace against 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.550
 samsung galaxy s2 and yes we'll see 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 how big the innovation is and whether it is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 the switch also from there to the 12 too 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.739
 really worth the outside pretty much the same 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.899
 that it is still a bit bigger and 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 even if we keep the world together 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.559
 you can see very similarities 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.410
 a bit thinner from below 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 but also in total looks 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.730
 have actually myself back ago 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.010
 we little change how to be very beautiful 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.290
 able to see 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.840
 the camera is not left and yes then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.720
 we let the fans because he also times 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.270
 start so we will the devices times 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.869
 high were 123 yes while so fans one 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.289
 few technical data equal to the camera 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.390
 and the s2 list is long in coming 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.920
 although we'll start right now 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.690
 have pressed to press 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.850
 yes on the back of the galaxy s2 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.909
 there is a 5 megapixel camera in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.390
 hd ready at the flash lite the galaxy ace 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:45.720
 synonymous has a 5 megapixel camera but 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 no hd and s.prozessoror we have synonymous 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 a big difference 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.069
 800 mega heart single core and 10 256 mb 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 ram 1 gb ram so you already have the 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.880
 Innovations are relatively large 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.090
 is happening in spite of this it 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 more quickly 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.479
 the first finished but that was 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.830
 because I'm on it long enough 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.349
 have pressed and repeat rain 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.739
 So I had to draw a total 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.690
 now you will be imprisoned and then 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.010
 Let's take a look at the surface and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.510
 of course, see the crass 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 difference between the sharpness of 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.989
 both devices 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.099
 I hope this is really better 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.860
 galaxy s2 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.290
 The colors are also better that one 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.379
 It's a bit more at s1 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.540
 a little bit of tristan, so we look 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.069
 may not look that way in the cameras 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.989
 good but you do not see individual here 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.180
 pixel and is it really really 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.890
 better so the focus is on 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.890
 f2 really have the two smartphones 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.450
 we android 2.3 here are two programs 6 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.730
 423 touchwiz 3.0 and touchwiz 4.0 from 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.510
 samsung 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.040
 We also have one here 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.040
 front camera we find the ace 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.330
 unfortunately not before 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.849
 yahoo has also done something 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.290
 The Samsung Galaxy Ace has 1050 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:13.319
 milliampere already battery and the samsung 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.140
 galaxy ace 2500 now look like that 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.770
 Terms are to give we technology 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:24.020
 sony xperia demo and look how 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.660
 quickly it loads 123 because we, of course 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.459
 ran over wlan 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:34.550
 you can see that it's two gold 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:37.310
 shares head a small request 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.640
 but before that you have already seen has 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.040
 still took longer and now 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.440
 starts the video only with five seconds 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.239
 at the train because of the ad so and we 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.270
 have not performed any benchmark test 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.540
 to see how her graphic and the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:01.100
 processor at galaxy s2 works this 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:02.300
 result 2365 and at ace 1 688 that 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.580
 I'll even make the clear difference 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.440
 not again black and white yes that 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.709
 Samsung Galaxy Ace has an internal 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.040
 store it so low that you have one 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.549
 memory card must insert in order to 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.900
 example to open the camera and we 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.600
 So speak for klaas bring a few 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.350
 megabyte only yes they have here at 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.210
 f2 increased to about 2.1 gigabytes 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.350
 because we can expand it with one 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:38.030
 micro sd hc card will be at ace 24 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.260
 inserted and at ace there that is me 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.350
 relatively handy then you have to 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.150
 not always take battery cover and then 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.630
 insert the SIM card as often as the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.010
 case is 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.140
 and yes that's really annoying 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.240
 so is still a little brown test around 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.169
 to watch how fast internet performance 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.090
 is the two devices to now 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.500
 At the same time , there are two 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.010
 is loaded 123 times how fast that 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.010
 is working 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:23.050
 with the ladies still much wlan is 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:26.950
 now ready and the samsung galaxy ace 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.390
 is also at some point ripped himself waiting 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.440
 as can already be seen here at the sv always 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:36.620
 super sharp it must immediately here 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.620
 put liquid scrolling so that it 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.840
 is done you can not zoom too 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.150
 quite as fluid as the sv but also in the 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.060
 principle liquid i would scroll that 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.090
 actually relatively fluid as well 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.310
 conclusion, one can say that is galaxy s2 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.750
 really a good update of the predecessor 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.630
 available for 229 euros the galaxy s 1 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.270
 for 180 euros the processor does 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.830
 Salinas the camera was improved that 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.560
 display is sharp and the colors full 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:14.210
 So who's dog to the galaxy ace 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.880
 own and consider the s2 to 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.260
 we would jump or change 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.610
 Definitely recommend the 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.500
 Chances that as a single two phones 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.370
 Of course, cancer is getting on 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.880
 max two absolutely higher than the sks 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.070
 exclusively new and therefore thank 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.600
 we are looking for your attention for your 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.590
 spectators have the anaconda question 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.930
 drives in the comments 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.850
 there you will also video nix video 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.950
 not left but buy between the 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.950
 two teams after the video
