00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.920
 victory for Brazil on the day but this

 frederick patacchia was very complicated 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 and finished tied but well advanced 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.710

 I did not fall in the south zone to overcome my 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.550
 injury I think this battery 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.340
 means a lot to me I know that still 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.280
