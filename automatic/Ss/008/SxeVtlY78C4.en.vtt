00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.620 
do we get a little flat bladed driver
just<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.620> get<00:05:51.800> in<00:05:51.979> there<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.520> we'd<00:05:52.970> hook<00:05:53.210> out

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
just to get in there and we'd hook out

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.649 
just to get in there and we'd hook out
that<00:05:53.960> that<00:05:54.710> bone<00:05:55.070> so<00:05:55.940> we've<00:05:56.090> got<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.419> buggy

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
that that bone so we've got the buggy

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.960 
that that bone so we've got the buggy

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
syringe weed we take around 10

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.860 
syringe weed we take around 10
milliliters<00:06:12.110> of<00:06:12.139> ink<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:13.150> we<00:06:14.150> put<00:06:14.419> it<00:06:14.450> into

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
milliliters of ink and we put it into

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.350 
milliliters of ink and we put it into
the<00:06:15.289> cartridge<00:06:15.950> let's<00:06:16.190> get<00:06:16.400> up<00:06:16.490> closer<00:06:16.880> to<00:06:17.210> the

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
the cartridge let's get up closer to the

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.140 
the cartridge let's get up closer to the
camp<00:06:17.630> to

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
camp to

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.720 
camp to
camera<00:06:18.690> so<00:06:19.320> that's<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.860> area<00:06:20.040> where<00:06:20.340> we're

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
camera so that's the area where we're

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.600 
camera so that's the area where we're
going<00:06:21.090> to<00:06:21.300> put<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.230> put<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.830> ink<00:06:22.980> in<00:06:23.190> we<00:06:23.370> put

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
that in there and we very slowly push

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.370 
that in there and we very slowly push
that<00:06:27.180> in<00:06:28.100> take<00:06:29.100> it<00:06:29.310> out<00:06:29.490> we'd<00:06:30.450> replace<00:06:30.870> the
