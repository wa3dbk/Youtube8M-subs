00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.989
 i 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 we're going to win because if we do not get 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.670
 the victory in all our matches 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.529
 we're not going to win the league this year all 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 weekends are important to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.829
 us and especially this next one we are going 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.829
 to win 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.210
 we have to play the 90 minutes 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 concentrated in all the matches and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.550
 this Saturday we also have to be 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.550
 concentrates 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.570
 If we want to be champions, we have to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.280
 win all our matches there are 5 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 points of difference between the real 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.940
 madrid and barcelona that's why we have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.600
 that win all our matches for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.600
 press them 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.670
 barcelona / madrid all teams 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 they can be dangerous and above all 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.810
 when they play against Real Madrid or 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.490
 barcelona because they make an overexertion 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.100
 to show that they have players 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.720
 good that are able to win this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.880
 type of match is difficult because 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 supposedly our rivals are 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 weeks are inferior to us but 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.440
 I know that they will fight until the end and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.400
 we have to be prepared for that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.400
 Y 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.030
 the most important thing to me is that 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.490
 let's score one more goal than the xerez me 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.950
 would like to see the realmadrid mark 3 4 or 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.950
 5 goals but I just want to win 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 I would like to see Barcelona lose but 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.470
 I think they will win because they are playing 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.120
 well this season I do not want them to win 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.980
 but I'm afraid they will do it because 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.130
 lately they are playing a great 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.130
 level 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 undoubtedly the valence because they are 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.420
 playing very well and want to keep their 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.340
 position in champions positions is a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 very good team and want to play in 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.980
 europe next year they will fight 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 to win 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.230
 I believe that Seville will win because 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.420
 as it happens with valencia they want to play 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.280
 in the Champions League next year have 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.080
 that keep your position up in the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.080
 table and then they have to win 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.550
 I think they are going to tie because the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.590
 Spanish plays at home I can not 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.160
 explain but I think it will end in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160
 a tie 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.409
 I think it will end in a draw 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.840
 because the tenerife plays at home 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.140
 it's just a feeling is more 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 feeling
