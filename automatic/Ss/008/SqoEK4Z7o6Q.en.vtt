00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 Hello everyone, tell me honestly who of you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.260
 I do not like the standard dual shock 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.810
 to playstation 3 today my hands kill 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.760
 inside and three wonderful controllers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.890
 which we can survey 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 there are classic controllers here 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.279
 ride and essentially replace the keyboard well 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.279
 what to see 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.489
 most honored guest controller 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.100
 which matt cuts themselves produced 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.949
 through participation in the design of the force mayor 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.589
 does gaming externally look like he certainly does nâ€™t 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.750
 on dual shock she's a xbox gamepad 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.390
 which is more convenient for many games 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.280
 This gamepad will appeal to many at least 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.530
 in addition to its configuration 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.839
 the controller itself you get 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.570
 comfortable handbag for carrying it on 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.819
 tournament and plus it customizes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.069
 and this concerns not only weights 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.229
 which you can add back panel 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:16.560
 either removing and closing the cap 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.569
 no ml lj ask the controller literally 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 disassembled to the last screws 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.619
 the set includes interchangeable stitches 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.729
 and lining 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.810
 main and sidewall matte and glossy 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.060
 deserves special attention 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.679
 controller connection is connected 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 via usb cable which 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.030
 a special input is inserted and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.369
 screwed onto the world crab play on 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.409
 gamepad is comfortable enough again 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 you have the opportunity to choose a convenient 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.420
 a combination of sticks and a cross with a stick 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.799
 there is convex and concave with no one 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.229
 does not interfere to deliver 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.750
 different definitely on this gamepad 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.000
 play more convenient than the standard pot 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.979
 comfortable trigger excellent Bandera and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 replaceable stacks and crosses this 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.990
 unconditional advantages convenient powerful cable 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
 and lack of delays all this is important not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.530
 in vain the controller was created in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 Collaborations 2 really important 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.609
 leaders matt cuts and 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 mlg he leaves a wonderful impression 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:13.220
 easy to get used to and customize for 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220
 myself 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.220
 hari gear 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.410
 FPS three simple but enough 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.540
 interesting controller he is not so 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 similar to the controller from xbox like 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.670
 a country road to this and not a sweetheart form 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.030
 classic with comfortable bumpers 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.040
 which there are two rows and mines there 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.320
 gamepad change opportunity 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.420
 the set is in a stick of different heights 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.880
 it is easy enough to choose a comfortable one 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.640
 choose a different height for yourself as well 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.830
 no one bothers the buttons on the controller 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 sensitivity is also adjusted 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.240
 You can fix the front left there 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.080
 sensitivity wheel but especially 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.810
 interesting here 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.670
 back panel there is a target button 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.920
 clicking on which aiming becomes 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.959
 much easier especially this 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.510
 useful in shooters of course and I think 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.730
 what gamers will enjoy 4 hours on the resp 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.800
 and not only among other things there is 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.590
 always lit backlight controller 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.630
 blue light but when you shoot it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.060
 turns red showing your 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.700
 backlight aggression can be easily turned off 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.410
 but it does not interfere in the game controller 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.600
 also wired and easy 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.260
 connects to the console no 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.540
 delays 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.980
 It was not noticed and play shooters like 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.970
 however in other genres 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.970
 it is very convenient 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.990
 more familiar to those who are used to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.610
 play fps on the computer but for some reason 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.510
 moved to sony playstation 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.540
 3 measles so 3 tactical asala in commander 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.790
 true to the habits of the ideal wsd 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.190
 in addition to the keyboard is substituted here 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.560
 justice mouse is worth saying 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.720
 that similar levers will delight 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.150
 far from all because to play on 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.370
 you have to have such a controller 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.470
 what kind of table do you play 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.230
 on the tv which hangs on the wall a 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.700
 become no play will be extremely comfortable yes 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.620
 and keep a similar controller on 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.440
 knees also does not seem comfortable 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.660
 but in general, of course, this control 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.390
 like the old school players who 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:29.030
 do not forget the battle must give counter-strike 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:31.820
 and other cult shooters all three 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.160
 controllers are interesting in their own way and each 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.880
 will choose that on the one who got used 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.669
 play pc 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.830
 take the choir so 3 more familiar 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.280
 console management of mlg groups 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.310
 request control and whether heri rf by three 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.479
 our personal choice fell on the last and for 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.479
 its simplicity and convenience 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.889
 we do not give any marks in principle 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.900
 all controllers are interesting in their own way and 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.610
 maybe you really don't need 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.150
 controller you used to play ordinary 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.370
 gave shock 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.900
 but anyway it's interesting 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.270
 offer that exist on the market 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.790
