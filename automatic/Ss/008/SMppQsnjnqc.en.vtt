00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello everyone knows shox how 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.240
 are you going to me I'm fine so 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 I am in small part on 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.900
 rails with chris luna 2010 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.600
 near drinks and tony neo band 2 so 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 I make you this little gameplay so that 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.789
 to explain how 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.590
 unlock success on rails 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 face the dragon background so especially 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.340
 did not pass the sleeve 2 it's very 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 very important otherwise the success will not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 will not differentiate way explain 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.950
 when you look at the success a tale 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.059
 how to do it then I confess 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.379
 that we still had a lot of trouble 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.770
 early we thought we had to do 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.320
 come a dragon and all so I wanted 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 we had a little trouble finding it and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.969
 it's totally by chance 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.489
 so should that then if you do everything 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.590
 only counterfeiters a minimum of 750 points 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.840
 because it was to take activities 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 see getting on the roof 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.510
 so we only have that there is there 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.439
 one or four who will make points 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.640
 after lending them to pass the round 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.350
 because you know that if you change 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.369
 of buildings it will not lament this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.200
 are our green 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.500
 so the best is to keep one year 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 viii on this building there so if you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.960
 are at several of these cameras that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.759
 stay here is only already seen right 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.439
 and that to offer a second time for 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.950
 for the colleague who will be served to you 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.119
 few guinea pigs at level 10 so we live 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.960
 here you have to take the elevator yourself 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.790
 are going to arrive all the way down there so we 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.299
 runs down the hall to finally care 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.310
 right fish jump from buildings there 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.820
 we take another right on this door 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.200
 there we open the electricity effort 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.579
 you must activate the current after 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.799
 success this name can not climb on the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.000
 roof 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.890
 so you see he has all are 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 arrived at sancerre his accounts had a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.340
 the map is not new for those 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 who discover it so it actually 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.259
 there are assets in the elevators so 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.759
 there then mounted on one of the two lifts 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.570
 to be able to access the roof when 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.330
 the elevator will go up so at the level 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.540
 strengths that I found so they 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.890
 have put three there all three weapons whose 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.830
 four days what climate and mastodon 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:22.080
 of double blow of the spell not who is who 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.790
 and run fast and tombstone I 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
 were looking for the number of gravestones 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.350
 there is new asset who is who is at all 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.570
 and not bad I talked about it in a 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.060
 next video will surely be the one 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.760
 according to so for success must be put 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 at the top of the ramp and pulled into the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.420
 dragon myth and here you have 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.900
 unlock the success face the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.060
 dragon 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 that's how much is all this chaos
