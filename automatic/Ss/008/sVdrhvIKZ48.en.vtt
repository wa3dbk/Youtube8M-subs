see<00:00:16.890> what<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:19.039> we<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
see what we do we get to what is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
see what we do we get to what is
probably<00:00:21.630> one<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> most<00:00:22.320> difficult

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
probably one of the most difficult

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.740 
probably one of the most difficult
portions<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.550> setting<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.390> tacking

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
portions which is setting up and tacking

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480 
portions which is setting up and tacking
one<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> these<00:00:25.080> manifolds<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:26.220> Jay<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
one of these manifolds and what Jay is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.920 
one of these manifolds and what Jay is
doing<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.599> two<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
doing here is it can see two of the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
doing here is it can see two of the
runners<00:00:28.260> he's<00:00:28.439> already<00:00:28.619> put<00:00:28.830> together<00:00:28.949> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
runners he's already put together in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
runners he's already put together in
tact<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.330> he's<00:00:30.449> putting<00:00:30.750> another<00:00:30.960> one<00:00:31.050> there

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
tact and he's putting another one there

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.659 
tact and he's putting another one there
if<00:00:31.439> he's<00:00:31.560> starting<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.920> build<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.340> third

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
if he's starting to build that third

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.130 
if he's starting to build that third
runner<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.390> he'll<00:00:33.570> build<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> fourth

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
runner and then he'll build the fourth

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.600 
runner and then he'll build the fourth
runner<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.800> kind<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.040> strange<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.460> it's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
runner it's kind of strange but it's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130 
runner it's kind of strange but it's
really<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> only<00:00:36.000> way<00:00:36.270> he<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.600> move<00:00:36.780> quickly

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
really the only way he can move quickly

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
really the only way he can move quickly
instead<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> having<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> helmet<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.489> flipping

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
instead of having a helmet and flipping

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.030 
instead of having a helmet and flipping
the<00:00:39.300> top<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.690> flipping<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> top<00:00:40.410> back<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the top down flipping the top back up is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.350 
the top down flipping the top back up is
to<00:00:41.370> go<00:00:41.489> ahead<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.300> thing

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
to go ahead and just get that thing

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
to go ahead and just get that thing
going<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.200> he'll<00:00:43.440> turn<00:00:43.920> his<00:00:44.100> head

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
going and then he'll turn his head

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.740 
going and then he'll turn his head
shield<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.969> give<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.390> flip

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
shield it and give it a little flip

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
shield it and give it a little flip
otherwise<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.530> process<00:00:47.190> takes<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> lot

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
otherwise that process takes a lot

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
otherwise that process takes a lot
longer<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.629> an<00:00:48.750> art<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.050> itself<00:00:49.140> right

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
longer that's an art in itself right

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
longer that's an art in itself right
there<00:00:49.649> these<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.730> travel<00:00:51.300> over<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> here

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
there these will all travel over to here

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
there these will all travel over to here
he's<00:00:52.230> getting<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.649> set<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.219> robot

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
he's getting one set up on this robot

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.130 
he's getting one set up on this robot
right<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.149> he's<00:00:54.300> back<00:00:54.539> forging<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> with

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
right now so he's back forging it with

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
right now so he's back forging it with
the<00:00:55.260> argon<00:00:55.559> he'll<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.520> rotation<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.120> make

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the argon he'll do one rotation to make

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
the argon he'll do one rotation to make
sure<00:00:57.420> he's<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.170> adjustments<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.800> need

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
sure he's on it make adjustments if need

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.849 
sure he's on it make adjustments if need
be<00:00:59.039> looks<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.120> set<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
be looks like it's set you can see the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.410 
be looks like it's set you can see the
welder<00:01:02.100> pulsing<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.229> it'll<00:01:04.470> rotate<00:01:05.420> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
welder pulsing and then it'll rotate so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510 
welder pulsing and then it'll rotate so
when<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> robot<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.900> done<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.340> makes

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
when the robot is done you see it makes

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310 
when the robot is done you see it makes
one<00:01:08.700> full<00:01:08.880> rotation<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
one full rotation and then it just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
one full rotation and then it just
finishes<00:01:10.680> until<00:01:11.580> watch<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.909> overlap

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
finishes until watch this overlap

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.469 
finishes until watch this overlap
finishes<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> argon<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:15.330> get

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
finishes and with the argon we get

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.590 
finishes and with the argon we get
perfect<00:01:15.720> penetration<00:01:16.500> each<00:01:17.100> time<00:01:17.490> there's<00:01:18.479> an

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
perfect penetration each time there's an

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.789 
perfect penetration each time there's an
example<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.380> were<00:01:19.439> talking<00:01:19.590> about

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
example of what we were talking about

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
example of what we were talking about
earlier<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:21.180> he's<00:01:21.330> doing<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.810> making

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
earlier so what he's doing is making

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.420 
earlier so what he's doing is making
sure<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.439> everything's<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.280> good

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
sure that everything's on there good

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.880 
sure that everything's on there good
everything<00:01:23.970> fits<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.380> it'll<00:01:25.560> head<00:01:25.770> off

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
everything fits and then it'll head off

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
everything fits and then it'll head off
to<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> finish<00:01:26.369> welder<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.909> welded<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> rest

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to a finish welder that welded the rest

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.039 
to a finish welder that welded the rest
of<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> very

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
of this go get it on this is a very

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
of this go get it on this is a very
tedious<00:01:31.320> portion<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.100> our<00:01:32.250> process<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
tedious portion of our process this is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
tedious portion of our process this is
what<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> most<00:01:34.110> labor-intensive<00:01:34.500> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
what this is the most labor-intensive is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.220 
what this is the most labor-intensive is
actually<00:01:35.430> getting<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:35.820> things

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
actually getting these things

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.050 
actually getting these things
correct<00:01:36.440> if<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.370> don't<00:01:37.580> get<00:01:37.670> them<00:01:37.790> correct

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
correct if you don't get them correct

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.180 
correct if you don't get them correct
especially<00:01:38.450> if<00:01:38.510> it's<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:38.750> teardrop<00:01:39.170> style<00:01:39.590> you

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
especially if it's a teardrop style you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.010 
especially if it's a teardrop style you
end<00:01:40.280> up<00:01:40.370> with<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> lot<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.730> boost<00:01:41.030> creep<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.870> end

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
end up with a lot of boost creep you end

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.500 
end up with a lot of boost creep you end
up<00:01:42.140> with<00:01:42.290> situations<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:43.160> can't<00:01:44.090> get<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:44.360> of

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
up with situations you can't get out of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.510 
up with situations you can't get out of
just<00:01:44.660> out<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.840> design<00:01:45.260> you<00:01:45.800> can't<00:01:46.040> turn<00:01:46.220> around

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
just out of design you can't turn around

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.580 
just out of design you can't turn around
and<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.700> can't<00:01:46.910> do<00:01:47.030> anything<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.600> so

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
and you can't do anything about it so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.140 
and you can't do anything about it so
we're<00:01:48.710> very<00:01:48.740> particular<00:01:49.400> about<00:01:49.430> how<00:01:49.760> we<00:01:49.820> do

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
we're very particular about how we do

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.700 
we're very particular about how we do
our<00:01:50.420> waste<00:01:50.780> gates<00:01:51.020> on<00:01:51.170> these<00:01:51.290> manifolds

manifold and then the up pipe if you're

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600 
manifold and then the up pipe if you're
off<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> few<00:02:27.230> degrees<00:02:27.320> here<00:02:27.770> turns<00:02:28.040> into<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.340> lot

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
off a few degrees here turns into a lot

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.850 
off a few degrees here turns into a lot
by<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> time<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.360> get<00:02:29.450> up<00:02:29.510> top<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:30.650> of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
by the time you get up top because of

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.620 
by the time you get up top because of
that<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:31.910> build<00:02:32.150> every<00:02:32.360> single

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that and because we build every single

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.290 
that and because we build every single
one<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.750> these<00:02:32.900> by<00:02:33.110> hand<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.640> our<00:02:34.790> jig<00:02:35.060> an

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
one of these by hand this is our jig an

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.650 
one of these by hand this is our jig an
actual<00:02:36.230> Subaru<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.550> cut<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:37.970> down<00:02:38.000> clip<00:02:38.480> it

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
actual Subaru so we cut it down clip it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.390 
actual Subaru so we cut it down clip it
so<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:38.900> could<00:02:39.050> use<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.470> any<00:02:39.740> intercooler

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
so we could use it for any intercooler

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.300 
so we could use it for any intercooler
manifold<00:02:41.300> sauce<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.620> all<00:02:42.740> jigged<00:02:43.130> out

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
manifold sauce we have it all jigged out

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.730 
manifold sauce we have it all jigged out
so<00:02:44.030> we'll<00:02:44.240> actually<00:02:44.390> fit<00:02:44.810> each<00:02:45.020> manifold<00:02:45.560> on

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
so we'll actually fit each manifold on

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.300 
so we'll actually fit each manifold on
this<00:02:45.920> motor<00:02:46.660> bring<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.780> up<00:02:47.900> know<00:02:48.800> exactly

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
this motor bring it up know exactly

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.100 
this motor bring it up know exactly
where<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.580> turbo<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.000> supposed<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.390> sit<00:02:50.600> run

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
where the turbo is supposed to sit run

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.510 
where the turbo is supposed to sit run
the<00:02:51.200> down<00:02:51.380> pipe<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.830> know<00:02:52.250> where<00:02:52.430> it's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
the down pipe down know where it's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.710 
the down pipe down know where it's
supposed<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.760> end<00:02:52.820> on<00:02:53.120> which<00:02:53.540> particular

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
supposed to end on which particular

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.140 
supposed to end on which particular
model<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.709> we<00:02:54.890> get<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> fit<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.850> brought<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
model and we get a fit so we brought the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.630 
model and we get a fit so we brought the
entire<00:02:56.239> car<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:56.870> motor<00:02:57.590> everything<00:02:58.220> we<00:02:58.310> need

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
entire car in motor everything we need

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.520 
entire car in motor everything we need
so<00:02:58.670> we<00:02:58.910> can<00:02:59.120> run<00:02:59.300> this<00:02:59.450> down<00:02:59.690> get<00:03:00.410> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
so we can run this down get the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.110 
so we can run this down get the
clearance<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.070> pipe<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.550> know<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.970> it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
clearance on the pipe and know that it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.699 
clearance on the pipe and know that it
fits<00:03:02.330> their<00:03:02.510> car<00:03:02.720> but<00:03:03.050> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.320> this<00:03:03.530> is

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
fits their car but this is this is

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.170 
fits their car but this is this is
actually<00:03:03.830> been<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> life<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.489> we<00:03:04.850> brought<00:03:05.030> this

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
actually been a life so we brought this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.180 
actually been a life so we brought this
in<00:03:05.390> several<00:03:05.750> years<00:03:05.930> ago<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.410> it's<00:03:06.950> helped

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
in several years ago and it's helped

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.660 
in several years ago and it's helped
quite<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.400> bit

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
quite a bit
