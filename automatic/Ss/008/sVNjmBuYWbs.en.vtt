 hi to all guys and welcome back with 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.699
 this nobleman on the canal today we are here 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 finally with a scud builder from 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.660
 a long time that does not carry a scud 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
 this time I'm here with a builder 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.449
 team made by the end of fifa dop 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.070
 then switch to its page bar 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 Youtube channel 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.050
 so he designed it for her 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 in the sense that in any case he had 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.420
 the idea about the team and then I say 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 who arranged it and structured it well 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.320
 because there was some hitch though 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.809
 however, both boys band is more talk 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.489
 a very strong team now sailing I will go 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.050
 to explain then it imports Czech 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.910
 Inter goalkeeper is that if we look 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.449
 ine the statistics I would have never given a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.309
 EUR 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the sense that he is a goalkeeper who second 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 me is very strong but they never believed 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 in him until I tried it 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.750
 in fact I paid him 2,900 credits and I have 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.180
 having said that this is the wrong deal 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.390
 of my life but then in reality yes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 the most beautiful deal is revealed to me 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.409
 could have done because really a lot 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.280
 strong as a goalkeeper then in defense 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.410
 we find golf and virgins or virgins now 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.360
 depends on 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.910
 the entity of the name however it is with all 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.090
 and two Argentine players 1 with a 75 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.240
 of speed 75 of defense 77 of physique 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.540
 the other 76 of speed 76 the ICE and the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.630
 third party physical prints are torres 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.630
 then nile 80 of speed 81 of physique 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.990
 perfect for a full-back now 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.490
 we find gamboa 87 speed and 72 of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.260
 physical we look at how much we paid 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:58.270
 torres nilo thousand three goals 3200 virgins 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.790
 4900 and gamboa 959 150 for a fullback 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.310
 right that very fast is not as bad as 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.890
 we find ourselves two people who would be 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.100
 a gullit that costs 15 thousand credits 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 boys he and gullit when he plays in who 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.380
 in game 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.840
 so you find it in your own game 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.760
 playing the game is called gullit 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.550
 he is called carlo spegna but in game e 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.190
 gullit 4 becomes weak 3 demonstrability 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.870
 82 speed 70 withdrawal but above all 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.440
 to physique christmas 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.530
 the other is breed cut paid 850 assaulted 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 boys punctured values ​​are not worth that 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.090
 then actually in game it's really a lot 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.510
 strong and now high war great 3d I believed 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.580
 3d is really very good stability 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.739
 for a player like that, that is 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.510
 we find a player who is actually a cc 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.780
 but in fact become what we 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.870
 it becomes very strong 1500 credits world 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.510
 normal normal race 33 depends wanted 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.720
 stability 70 diversity at 74 shooting at 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.700
 77 free with 75 passing values 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.130
 very balanced 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.100
 I think this player is here 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.900
 perfect to be coc hi guys 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.280
 if it does it become the cc at a shot that is 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.770
 absurd is really not regret it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.840
 to them we find arroyo which would be e 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.610
 ronaldo silver then this scott 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.850
 builder we find both gullit and ronaldo 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.010
 silver is very strong 5 of a stability 4 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.560
 I saw the nine matches from the high goal 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.340
 Greek bass war intends to go up a lot e 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.120
 stay up 14,500 credits 88 of 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.190
 shooting speed 74 75 dribbling 74 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.290
 of physical guys very good values ​​but 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.810
 very good to find another 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.480
 player that costs a lot 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.720
 41 thousand 3 weak DVDs 4 demonstrability 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.519
 high speed war 73 high of 73 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.320
 80 dribble shot 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.910
 then let's first make one 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.940
 premise is a player who costs a lot 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.800
 coast is more than 3 4 3 4 players of 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.709
 but this team is fundamental 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.840
 because otherwise as an alternative to him there 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.050
 it would be this player a few now 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.550
 I'll show you, but it's not me 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.819
 really liked it 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.330
 which would unfortunately be this thousand 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.430
 player here in my opinion sins a lot with 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.829
 the left in the sense that for many it is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.480
 very strong marks easily 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.370
 for me it is really big 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.709
 sin because he is a player who does not 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.690
 never scores ef in front of the door wrong 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.310
 a lot so if you don't know whether to buy 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.280
 him you can buy him or 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.450
 you can even buy this 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.430
 player that I'll show you now 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.980
 which is another 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.630
 alternative to the two phillips players 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.970
 which costs 3,600 credits so it's a lot 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.710
 cheap if you don't want to spend it 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.210
 for townsend that maybe I don't like and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.400
 to say that it costs too much 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.880
 Phillips is that the four 4 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.160
 verifiability 88 of speed at the shooting 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.380
 58 withdrawal on paper but in my opinion it was 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.630
 almost 70 less because in any case yes 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.120
 it attracts very well is a meter and 83 ce 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.250
 so a very physical if you try it 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.940
 looks a lot like the movements it does 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.100
 little bar 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.770
 if you try a little while ago and try philips 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.810
 they are very similar to the no shooting that 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.870
 very similar so I recommend you 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.790
 try it as I said in the past 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.080
 scott miller will not upload clips 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.760
 now I have even forgotten to 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.880
 present you a player that one 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.370
 fundamental and valencia 8 matches and 7 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.560
 weak toe goal 2 demonstrability 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.730
 high low roles grace boys is 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.610
 fortissimo 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.580
 other tile now try him then 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.500
 oh well for obvious reasons you have to use 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.020
 valenciana google aol for needle boys 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.300
 the ogre is almost 40 thousand credits tested 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.110
 to him that costs 14 thousand and is worth the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.820
 double 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.520
 this guys said like I said before 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.110
 scud builder won't upload clips 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.340
 because you will try the team 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.050
 anyway both the clips let's just say 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.750
 not fundamental as it is anyway 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.460
 you go well you see that you make goals though 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.020
 whatever each must prove to 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.000
 team so there is no value 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.990
 objective on the team if it does not go 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.210
 proven 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.300
 having said that I like the cia tom live 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.220
 pass from fifa dop and more 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.500
 let me know what you think of this 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.660
 team a greeting and I remind you that 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.570
 this team costs almost one hundred thousand 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.570
 creti ciao a tutti and the next beautiful
