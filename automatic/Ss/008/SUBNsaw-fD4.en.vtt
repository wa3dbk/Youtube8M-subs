00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.850
 he was a very very crazy dj right here 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.539
 here resides jay for all 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.879
 Chile and the world here is the project 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.740
 crazy slow flyer a plane made 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.890
 completely likely almost finished 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.410
 already seemed to fly to my nephew cristÃ³bal 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.240
 I have it mounted at this moment about 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.630
 the machine to get the center 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.929
 gravity 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.510
 the audio was mentally hung up already 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.820
 is practically ready for the flight 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.590
 the engine is mounted I put some 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.900
 counterweights there with coins to be able 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.180
 get the center gravity the pile is 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.380
 mounted there in the interior 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 there you see 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.730
 to the molded with sandpaper all handmade 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.470
 by hand the servos are already assembled 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.590
 there is the being will fly at the helm of 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.940
 address or roger in English serbo 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 for the elevator 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.049
 and they are connected with wires and cough 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.049
 very thin cable how is it called 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.759
 of a electric cable intercom with 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.130
 very granite cytophone and I guess that 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:16.350
 they will be resistant and this is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.299
 cleaned the elevator and the rudder 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.480
 depth bone forgiveness at the helm of 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.640
 depth and radar 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.360
 vertical rudder 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.360
 is it so 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.580
 and let's see if they work or not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580
 do they work 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.550
 here we have flowers 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.259
 and elevator 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.979
 there we can see how the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.979
 serbo 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.680
 and we are going to do a small project 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.420
 tell with motor 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.420
 this is entertaining observe 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.320
 I'm moving it with the elevator 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.070
 only with the effect of the propeller 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.070
 on the tail 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.850
 down 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.130
 upwards 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.720
 and the plane gets a nariÃ£ angle 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.250
 up only with the elevation that you 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.090
 grant the wing with the engine we are going to 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.090
 assemble the engine a little bit 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.880
 above 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.959
 down up 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.959
 can see the effect of the tail 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.630
 the rudder by now does not have much 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.070
 aspect because it is mounted on the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.070
 machine then moves 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.060
 there is next to fly 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.310
 the super slow flyer racing 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.390
 there are precision designs 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.390
 yes ya baby
