no but I think that he's uh he's been

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.169 
no but I think that he's uh he's been
very<00:00:09.469> courageous<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.950> not<00:00:11.130> caring<00:00:11.790> about<00:00:11.910> who

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
very courageous and not caring about who

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.030 
very courageous and not caring about who

he offends my coming out and saying the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.060 
he offends my coming out and saying the
things<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.340> need<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.700> said<00:00:15.170> here<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.470> if

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
things that need to be said here and if

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.090 
things that need to be said here and if
you<00:00:17.250> want<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.580> win<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> Republicans<00:00:19.949> that

you want to win the Republicans that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.470 
you want to win the Republicans that
certainly<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.550> shown<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.910> way<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.330> when

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
certainly have shown the way that when

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.750 
certainly have shown the way that when
you<00:00:21.689> run<00:00:22.260> someone<00:00:22.680> who<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.039> popular<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:25.050> win

you run someone who is popular you win

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.279 
you run someone who is popular you win
sometimes<00:00:26.760> even<00:00:27.210> when<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.420> run<00:00:27.570> an<00:00:27.689> actor<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
sometimes even when you run an actor you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.870 
sometimes even when you run an actor you
win<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.900> um<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> know<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.910> guess<00:00:33.210> I'm<00:00:34.760> you<00:00:35.760> know

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880

I<00:00:36.149> only<00:00:36.899> say<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.800> saw<00:00:38.100> his<00:00:38.250> name<00:00:38.430> out

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I only say that he saw his name out

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549 
I only say that he saw his name out
there<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.450> I'd<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.170> us<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> start

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
there because I I'd like us to start

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
there because I I'd like us to start
thinking<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.160> way<00:00:41.219> i<00:00:41.370> don't<00:00:41.520> i<00:00:41.879> don't<00:00:41.910> really

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
thinking that way i don't i don't really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.779 
thinking that way i don't i don't really
want<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.100> don't<00:00:44.100> want<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> spend<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> whole

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
want to I don't want to spend a whole

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.600 
want to I don't want to spend a whole
lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.239> running<00:00:45.450> symbolic<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:47.520> know

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
lot of time running symbolic you know

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.389 
lot of time running symbolic you know
campaigns<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> should<00:00:48.719> really

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
campaigns I think we should really

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.380 
campaigns I think we should really
because<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> whole<00:00:50.610> host<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.940> things<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.210> need

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
because a whole host of things we need

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
because a whole host of things we need
to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> certainly<00:00:53.190> have

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to do and you can you certainly have

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
to do and you can you certainly have
mentioned<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.820> couple<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.480> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
mentioned a couple of things that in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
mentioned a couple of things that in
your<00:00:55.110> next<00:00:55.410> thing<00:00:56.010> you're<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> have

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
your next thing you're going to have

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
your next thing you're going to have
here<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> September<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.960> really

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
here in September that are really

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.080 
here in September that are really
critical<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.800> terms<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.840> voting<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:02.000> you<00:01:03.000> know

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
critical in terms of voting and you know

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
critical in terms of voting and you know
preferential<00:01:03.780> voting<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.589> are

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
preferential voting that these are

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.340 
preferential voting that these are
really<00:01:05.100> important<00:01:05.869> things<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.080> need<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> be

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
really important things that need to be

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
really important things that need to be
instituted<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> make<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.670> democratic

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
instituted to make this more democratic

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.830 
instituted to make this more democratic
but<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.460> think<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:11.970> parties<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.510> very

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but I think these two parties are very

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.520 
but I think these two parties are very
weak<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.460> dan<00:01:14.460> mentioned<00:01:15.259> 1856<00:01:16.259> there

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
weak right now dan mentioned 1856 there

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.240 
weak right now dan mentioned 1856 there
with<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> Republicans<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> four

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
with the Republicans and you know four

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
with the Republicans and you know four
or<00:01:20.280> five<00:01:20.430> years<00:01:20.610> later<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
or five years later there was a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.820 
or five years later there was a
Republican<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> White<00:01:22.290> House<00:01:24.830> these

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
Republican in the White House these

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.490 
Republican in the White House these
times<00:01:26.220> occur<00:01:26.610> very<00:01:26.820> rarely<00:01:27.210> when<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.990> political

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
times occur very rarely when a political

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
times occur very rarely when a political
party<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.100> weak<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.270> literally<00:01:30.540> can

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
party is so weak that it literally can

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.160 
party is so weak that it literally can
be<00:01:30.930> killed<00:01:31.140> off<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.020> both

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
be killed off and and I think both

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.020 
be killed off and and I think both
parties<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> position<00:01:35.549> right<00:01:36.000> now

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
parties are in that position right now

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.280 
parties are in that position right now
and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:39.180> group<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.630> people<00:01:39.869> if

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and I think that if a group of people if

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.950 
and I think that if a group of people if
we<00:01:41.159> had<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.460> real<00:01:41.700> national<00:01:42.090> leadership<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we had some real national leadership and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.649 
we had some real national leadership and
then<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> real<00:01:43.350> commitment<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.890> grassroots

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
then a real commitment to grassroots

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.130 
then a real commitment to grassroots
organizing<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.829> form<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.390> new<00:01:48.390> democratic

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
organizing to form a new democratic

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
organizing to form a new democratic
party<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> call<00:01:49.979> themselves<00:01:50.159> call<00:01:50.670> ourselves

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
