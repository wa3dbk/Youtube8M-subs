00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
weighs in at 11 6 and then comes in like

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.580 
weighs in at 11 6 and then comes in like
a<00:00:49.460> heavy<00:00:50.060> swing<00:00:50.390> weight<00:00:50.570> which<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.380> lot

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
a heavy swing weight which is a lot

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.170 
a heavy swing weight which is a lot
harder<00:00:51.740> for<00:00:52.040> me<00:00:52.130> because<00:00:52.160> I'm<00:00:52.490> used<00:00:52.700> to<00:00:52.790> a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
harder for me because I'm used to a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.000 
harder for me because I'm used to a
lighter<00:00:53.540> swing<00:00:53.900> way<00:00:54.020> with<00:00:54.230> my<00:00:54.320> normal<00:00:54.650> racket

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
lighter swing way with my normal racket

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.640 
lighter swing way with my normal racket
and<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.670> lot<00:00:56.090> more<00:00:56.240> headlight<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.380> it's<00:00:57.500> very

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
and a lot more headlight so it's very

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.170 
and a lot more headlight so it's very
hard<00:00:57.980> for<00:00:58.040> me<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.310> move<00:00:58.400> over<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.060> think

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
hard for me to move over this so I think

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.030 
hard for me to move over this so I think
I<00:00:59.360> actually<00:00:59.510> preferred<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.560> mid<00:01:00.740> plus

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
I actually preferred the the mid plus

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.460 
I actually preferred the the mid plus
but<00:01:01.430> still<00:01:01.820> good<00:01:02.030> stick<00:01:02.300> but

the swing weights kind of high I felt a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.660 
the swing weights kind of high I felt a
little<00:01:25.250> sluggish<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.760> it<00:01:26.800> also<00:01:27.800> what<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.520> was

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
little sluggish on it also what I was

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.890 
little sluggish on it also what I was
surprised<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.210> mid<00:01:29.420> where<00:01:29.690> I<00:01:29.720> was

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
surprised with the mid where I was

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.180 
surprised with the mid where I was
really<00:01:30.260> controlling<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.800> even<00:01:31.070> though<00:01:31.160> I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
really controlling it even though I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.580 
really controlling it even though I
didn't<00:01:31.460> expect<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.450> racket<00:01:32.870> was<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.380> lot

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
didn't expect it this racket was a lot

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.469 
didn't expect it this racket was a lot
more<00:01:33.770> powerful<00:01:34.130> than<00:01:34.220> expected<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.910> found<00:01:35.390> my

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
more powerful than expected I found my

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.090 
more powerful than expected I found my
shots<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.840> be<00:01:35.960> especially<00:01:36.560> with<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.890> open

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
shots to be especially with the open

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.590 
shots to be especially with the open
stream<00:01:37.280> pattern<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.700> have<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:37.940> lot<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.150> pace<00:01:38.360> of

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
stream pattern to have a lot of pace of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.880 
stream pattern to have a lot of pace of
a<00:01:38.750> lot<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:38.990> bite<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:41.450> my<00:01:42.110> favorite<00:01:42.470> shot<00:01:42.680> him

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
a lot of bite and my favorite shot him

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.650 
a lot of bite and my favorite shot him
with<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.400> probably<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.880> backhand<00:01:44.510> slice

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
with this is probably the backhand slice

with this is probably the backhand slice

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
it has plenty of plow through so with a

it has plenty of plow through so with a
combined<00:01:47.119> with<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.300> polyester<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.080> open

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
combined with a polyester and the open

combined with a polyester and the open
stream<00:01:48.500> pattern<00:01:48.650> i<00:01:48.860> was<00:01:48.979> able<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.280> really

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
stream pattern i was able to really

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.120 
stream pattern i was able to really
night<00:01:50.479> through<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.750> fall<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.470> slices<00:01:51.830> so

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
night through the fall on the slices so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.240 
night through the fall on the slices so
it<00:01:52.759> was<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> great<00:01:53.180> racket<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:54.410> just<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:55.040> swing

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
it was a great racket but just the swing

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.040 
it was a great racket but just the swing
was<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.400> little<00:01:55.640> too<00:01:55.700> high<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.030> me<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:56.810> i<00:01:56.869> think

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
was a little too high for me but i think

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.900 
was a little too high for me but i think
if<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.440> strokes<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.490> power<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
if you have the strokes and the power to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.719 
if you have the strokes and the power to
use<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.479> he'd<00:01:59.750> be<00:01:59.869> a<00:01:59.900> great<00:02:00.140> sting<00:02:00.490> next<00:02:01.490> up<00:02:01.610> we

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
use it he'd be a great sting next up we

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.070 
use it he'd be a great sting next up we
have<00:02:01.759> Danny<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.450> Danny<00:02:02.690> what<00:02:02.900> are<00:02:02.930> your

you know my first impressions of this

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.669 
you know my first impressions of this
racket<00:02:07.640> kind<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:07.970> similar<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:09.260> mid<00:02:09.500> plus

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
racket kind of similar to the mid plus

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.710 
racket kind of similar to the mid plus
is<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:09.920> when<00:02:10.730> you<00:02:10.820> pick<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.000> up<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.540> kind<00:02:11.690> of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
is that when you pick it up it's kind of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.790 
is that when you pick it up it's kind of
different<00:02:11.930> because<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.260> feels<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.769> feels

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
different because it feels it feels

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.190 
different because it feels it feels
pretty<00:02:13.160> heavy<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:14.540> only<00:02:14.660> eleven<00:02:14.989> point<00:02:15.170> six

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200

pretty heavy it's only eleven point six
ounces<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.070> think<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> feels<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.670> bit<00:02:16.700> heavy

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
ounces but I think it feels a bit heavy

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.430 
ounces but I think it feels a bit heavy
because<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.480> balance<00:02:17.810> on<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.110> only<00:02:18.230> two

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440

but<00:02:36.980> anything<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.489> slightly<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
but anything just slightly out of the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.240 
but anything just slightly out of the
sweet<00:02:38.420> spot<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.720> was<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.290> little<00:02:40.010> jarring

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
sweet spot it was just a little jarring

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.880 
sweet spot it was just a little jarring
to<00:02:40.340> my<00:02:40.489> arm<00:02:40.700> which<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.910> didn't<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:42.830> I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
to my arm which I didn't like but I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.410 
to my arm which I didn't like but I
might<00:02:43.160> still<00:02:43.250> had<00:02:43.400> control<00:02:43.519> with<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.060> itself

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
might still had control with this itself

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.560 
might still had control with this itself
it<00:02:44.630> felt<00:02:44.900> good<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.110> my<00:02:45.200> overheads<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.830> volleys

if<00:02:47.570> there's<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.840> slightly<00:02:48.110> more<00:02:48.350> stable<00:02:48.680> i

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
if there's just slightly more stable i

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.680 
if there's just slightly more stable i
would<00:02:49.250> pick<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.790> out<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.060> my<00:02:50.209> favorite<00:02:50.570> but

really grew on me my racket that I use
is<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> dense<00:03:08.550> string<00:03:08.819> pattern<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:10.080> getting

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
is a dense string pattern so getting

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.480 
is a dense string pattern so getting
used<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> open<00:03:10.830> pattern<00:03:11.130> took<00:03:11.340> me<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
used to the open pattern took me a

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.180 
used to the open pattern took me a
little<00:03:11.610> while<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:12.090> control<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:13.500> generating

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
little while for control but generating

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.350 
little while for control but generating
the<00:03:14.310> amount<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.550> spin<00:03:14.670> one<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.090> did<00:03:15.270> with

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the amount of spin one that I did with

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.750 
the amount of spin one that I did with
it<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.930> mean<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.860> was<00:03:16.980> really<00:03:17.220> fun<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.520> hit<00:03:17.610> with

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it I mean it was really fun to hit with

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.699 
it I mean it was really fun to hit with
at<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> baseline<00:03:18.530> another<00:03:19.530> thing<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
at the baseline another thing that

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.990 
at the baseline another thing that
really<00:03:19.860> sticks<00:03:20.070> out<00:03:20.220> like<00:03:20.280> Danny<00:03:20.610> was<00:03:20.790> saying

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
really sticks out like Danny was saying

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300 
really sticks out like Danny was saying
is<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.570> swing<00:03:21.750> weights<00:03:21.930> pretty<00:03:22.170> high<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.620> it

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
is the swing weights pretty high so it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.620 
is the swing weights pretty high so it
takes<00:03:23.459> take<00:03:23.880> some<00:03:24.060> work<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.270> get<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> racket

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
takes take some work to get the racket

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.090 
takes take some work to get the racket
in<00:03:24.810> position<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.350> once<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.740> get<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.950> racket

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
in position but once you get the racket

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.910 
in position but once you get the racket
going<00:03:26.370> ton<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.209> plow<00:03:27.330> through<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:28.320> really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
going ton of plow through and really

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.740 
going ton of plow through and really
stood<00:03:29.190> out<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.340> volleys<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.300> high<00:03:30.450> swing

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
stood out in volleys to that high swing

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.150 
stood out in volleys to that high swing
weight<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.530> gives<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.980> lot<00:03:32.100> of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
weight really gives you a lot of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.770 
weight really gives you a lot of
stability<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.180> punches<00:03:33.630> through

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
stability and it just punches through

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.040 
stability and it just punches through
the<00:03:33.870> ball<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:34.970> overall<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.090> made<00:03:36.690> my<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:37.020> a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
the ball so overall it made my game a

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.410 
the ball so overall it made my game a
little<00:03:37.170> bit<00:03:37.320> better<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.590> think<00:03:38.060> great<00:03:39.060> thanks

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
little bit better I think great thanks

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.900 
little bit better I think great thanks
so<00:03:39.510> much<00:03:39.660> stress<00:03:39.930> which<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.550> wraps<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
so much stress which and that wraps it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.790 
so much stress which and that wraps it
