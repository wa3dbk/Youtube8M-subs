00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
perfect repetition and his body is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
perfect repetition and his body is
completely<00:01:34.590> tight<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.729> every

completely tight just like every

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
completely tight just like every
exercise<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.810> already<00:01:37.079> performs<00:01:37.530> he's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
exercise that already performs he's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
exercise that already performs he's
always<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.399> keep<00:01:38.610> his<00:01:38.729> chest<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.240> his

in pike it's going to change a little
bit<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.469> emphasis<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> movement

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
bit of the emphasis of the movement

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.389 
bit of the emphasis of the movement
towards<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> triceps<00:01:57.750> more<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.890> again<00:01:59.189> it's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
towards the triceps more but again it's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580

the<00:01:59.490> same<00:01:59.729> lift<00:02:00.030> overall<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.049> already<00:02:01.320> doesn't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the same lift overall so already doesn't

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
the same lift overall so already doesn't
change<00:02:01.799> body<00:02:02.100> position<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.670> mechanics<00:02:03.149> he

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
change body position of mechanics he

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.640 
change body position of mechanics he
simply<00:02:03.869> changes<00:02:04.229> position<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.829> his<00:02:04.920> hands

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
simply changes position of his hands

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.980 
simply changes position of his hands
and<00:02:06.220> then<00:02:06.340> one<00:02:06.580> last<00:02:06.790> show<00:02:07.690> we're<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:07.930> to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
and then one last show we're going to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
arms out to a wider position now this

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640 
arms out to a wider position now this
will<00:02:12.820> do<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> little<00:02:13.240> bit<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.170> number<00:02:14.320> on<00:02:14.560> your

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
will do a little bit of a number on your

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
shoulder a little bit so you want to be

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.390 
shoulder a little bit so you want to be
careful<00:02:17.260> doing<00:02:17.740> this<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:17.980> heavy<00:02:18.130> weight

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
careful doing this with heavy weight

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
careful doing this with heavy weight
however<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.210> great<00:02:19.600> back<00:02:19.840> activator<00:02:20.320> so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
however it's a great back activator so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.130 
however it's a great back activator so
it's<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.830> good<00:02:21.310> one<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.910> again<00:02:22.540> using<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
it's a good one to do again using the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.230 
it's a good one to do again using the
exact<00:02:23.500> same<00:02:23.680> body<00:02:23.920> position<00:02:24.520> but<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.060> time

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
exact same body position but this time

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.640 
exact same body position but this time
already's<00:02:25.540> got<00:02:25.600> his<00:02:25.810> hands<00:02:26.020> out<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.380> little

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
wider and he's going to get a little

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.050 
wider and he's going to get a little
more<00:02:28.270> emphasis<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.960> his<00:02:29.080> pecs<00:02:29.460> great<00:02:30.460> exercise
