00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.999
 Saturday 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:23.149
 I think immediately to critics today we can no longer ignore 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.519
 ceased to embody social networks even for adults this is a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.970
 private use venus 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.749
 for many people seem to have become commonplace 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.870
 for children and adolescents 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.750
 let alone why people make massive use why 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.989
 this digit 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.980
 we see that even if the differences 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.300
 teenagers very important faces these social networks 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.480
 well they have faces that are poor 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.130
 for example when we look at the five fingers of images of images and 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.840
 pictures and then three months were needed each member this 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.809
 evolution 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.140
 Thursday at the afp according to which today Egypt all the people who 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.649
 were the simplistic ideas of the actors became actors 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.710
 that is to say 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.110
 produce their own data exchange information 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 sensations most used in madiran at school to help the most 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.460
 used but what not to believe that but if we study the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 tasks an alarming portrait 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.940
 it is obviously facebook since 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 young favorite social network of teenage girls 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.620
 twitter has replayed 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.900
 it's a young mother by the blogs that are anyway to make it 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.810
 much more to use this and since is for several years already 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 jean-michel lebeau is therefore the professor in literary terminale 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.470

 his nice alumni who have already found work finished their studies 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.290
 higher etc. 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830
 and maybe it's future student 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.260
 the purpose of this maneuver enough to make sure that second grade students 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.970
 Swedish is a subsidiary field later some specificities 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.680
 his wall on which we wrote 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.230
 destroyed fruit prices 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.230
 fuction 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.470
 to limit them to 140 characters but we can not exclude from him the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.659
 sacredness 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.249
 to each message 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.489
 and for 100 euros we read on his name the messages of others 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 a teacher she joins 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.159
 once in France to use vincent this system 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.650
 courses offered in front of students the students are all in class in 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.330
 computer room a tiny ten on the computer and then they are 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.930
 invited to react when interesting is that it is by Flemish decree 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.589
 and his masses for the students 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.389
 it's about combining a quality requirement 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.289
 then at the end of the session 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.209
 professor sandrine a plenary session the students stop to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.309
 watch a movie we share 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.119
 but in the light of everything that everyone has written 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.619
 but there is still an argumentation exercise that was difficult to 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.829
 the part of the pupils all the more difficult as they are limited to 140 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:52.690
 characters 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.860
 on one side the beast 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.860
 he swallowed right goal 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:58.830
 difficult 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.190
 this is the recipe in the year of blogging men and it is much more 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.250
 common and a lot of teachers the coming years an educational purpose 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.439
 it's definitely better 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.229
 and then already a few times 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.129
 she uses a lot then unstable class it's the students who 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.909
 write in the blog but he should not write here exploit them 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.959
 the multimedia in his opinion proves it in particular to 1% the emission delivered a 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.709
 minute that it is video is obviously inspired by the show a 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.879
 day a book 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.089
 she asks the students to present indeed 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.969
 and in a humorous way a sign he liked 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.659
 the students are happy to have produced that in fact these are 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.089
 productions they are themselves which are communicated are visible by all the 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:38.819
 world such an effect values ​​them 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.439
 the sages would not have, moreover, as uses of the tice in general 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.729
 college is because we can generalize 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.159
 honor 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.189
 barnaby several benefits besides the fact that students are in 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.129
 authentic situations of communication 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.760
 as they worked together to work together on a common project 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.749
 find benchmarks 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.649
 certainly it is an opportunity that we are given to make pedagogy of 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:59.349
 project 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.349
 patassé passed not a spin-off miracle recipe 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.689
 it's called mom 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.689
 a differentiated pedagogy project pedagogy and in my opinion it's 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.299
 it's something essential 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.129
 for the jean-moulin college 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.329
 What am I 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.269
