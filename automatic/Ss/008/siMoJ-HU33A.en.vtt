00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.650
 hi everyone I'm pete seeger and 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.840
 welcome back to the channel to another 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.210
 video more than under 4 this time 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.680
 we bring the good the bad and the ugly of the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.810
 beta what I thought was good the bad and 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.189
 the ugly not because if I finally tell them 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.450
 that I commented with a word in the video 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.670
 or something similar to know that 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.140
 they were here but here I would prefer that 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.880
 you be what it seemed good what 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 that they did not like and that they liked it or not 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.079
 they liked the beta use the ugly 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.309
 let's start with the good because I like it 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.500
 be positive and you always have to be 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.930
 positive in life the worst point that 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.969
 I would like to deal with is the class 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.800
 classes seem much more balanced 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.840
 even so it is noted that the superiority of 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.190
 the class of assault is still the class 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.350
 par excellence that will be in the in 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.730
 the battle front facing and 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.770
 dying several times and then 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.080
 ironically being revived by others 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.850
 assault partners but I thought that 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.010
 somehow all the classes are 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.329
 Well-balanced weapons are a good 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.700
 option and the fact that they have 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.199
 carbines rifles marksman or rifles 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.450
 for any class makes that some 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.340
 way the attachments are the real 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.740
 option of why you choose a class and not 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.060
 necessarily the main weapon too 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 I used the changes they made to 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.409
 the recognition class the fact of 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.290
 put c4 again the grenades 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.750
 sensors or rather they are not grenade 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.120
 for 6 hours while the term balls 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 not does not translate very well in the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.930
 Spanish and also even small things 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.280
 as reducing the suppression for 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.080
 more precise are the rifles of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 sniper and also the fact of already 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.470
 I would not see as much as the brightness of a thousand 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.420
 suns a telescopic sight to the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 distance where you can not see anything else 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.710
 that a bright spot on the new 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.260
 skills of what the engine would be 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.940
 frostbite graphic number three I liked it 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.770
 a lot of interactivity with the map all 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.870
 what of evolution more than anything after 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.120
 of destructiveness rather I would say 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.640
 first is the interactivity with the 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.650
 map the power to put the buoys up the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.790
 buildings with elevator although it seems 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.530
 which is rather being behind 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.290
 teleported on a 'star' machine 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.150
 trek 'things like that make great the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.890
 game to be able to explode extinguishers and other 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.930
 are the small details that make 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 the players who dedicate a little more 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.860
 of time to explore the game and see 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.170
 all the features can be 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.030
 a little later than your enemy 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.940
 the destruction appeared quite well not 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.739
 as to the term and as Nazi exaggerated as 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.660
 in bad company 2 where practically 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.550
 it was on a flat stage you did not have 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 no type of coverage in the sense 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.100
 think a little more about what would be the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.440
 balance which 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.660
 the coverage can block roads 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.640
 can open others without unbalancing the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.320
 That game itself appeared quite well 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.420
 other things that maybe not many 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.180
 say that they loved it is for example 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 the new screen to appear in the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.980
 allies in some vehicle or something 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.270
 it's much more graphic and much easier 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.640
 to use that previous versions 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.680
 where they could only choose a 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.780
 name and now I could make themselves 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.400
 if you are religious and go out 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.060
 to the battlefield if you have no idea what 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.770
 was going on 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.720
 in this way problems of a camera 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.630
 general of what has happened around 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.850
 from that person that vehicle and gives them a 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.830
 general idea if they can appear or not 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.750
 appear in that place without dying in the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.280
 I try something else that I'm probably going to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.410
 do first mention it and the only 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.880
 is the recharge by steps I thought 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
 impressive what they did especially 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.660
 with the rpg is where the recharge is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.950
 quite slow by rocket and good if not 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.530
 you know what I mean is that if 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.630
 you unload a rocket shoots it 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.850
 fly out you want to place a 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 new take out the toy wherever 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.330
 put it on because it's always a 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340
 mystery they place it at the end of their 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.530
 rocket launcher then it does not twist it anymore 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.819
 can shoot if you suddenly 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.999
 they see an enemy and barely 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.819
 they did not put the tip is what she said 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.859
 and they did not manage to screw it to be able to 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.620
 shoot you can even change 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.150
 a weapon defend the enemy kill him and 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.590
 when they return to their rpg the only thing 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.139
 they have to do is coil they do not have 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.329
 that start the recharge mechanism a 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.069
 and again until they have it complete 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.900
 but they can do it by steps and 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.609
 goods are the little points about what 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.709
 well I like it below and four in 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.389
 less than four minutes so to speak 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.389
 now we are going towards what is bad what 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.069
 negative one to everyone gave him a 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.799
 explosive to the being of the few options 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.569
 that had every class everyone has 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.280
 explosives I did not like much that launches 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.859
 in c4 and that had rank of 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.739
 explosion so good the fact that 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.239
 tormo have xm25 in the support class in 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.829
 grenade launcher that even some what 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.570
 changed by the defibrillators to 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.090
 keep killing more people and doing more 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.470
 explosive spam the rpg as such that 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.150
 It is the weapon par excellence of the people 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.710
 that starts playing the game and that ok 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.090
 is discovering the game but think 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.009
 that the best way to kill and the only thing 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.080
 what they do is ruin the experience of 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.750
 others I hope that is solved when seeing 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.820
 than the other accessories of each class 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.390
 they are better in better options to 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.700
 choose 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.980
 place of explosive bombs and everything 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.780
 others together with the explosives I 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.290
 I also refer to the rpg that could be 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.220
 fix to laser-marked vehicles 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.230
 fortunately that will not be in the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.580
 game for your final version if you want 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.470
 know more beta changes can 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.300
 search in the channel I have a video of 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.700
 done prior to this one in which 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 he talked about what the changes will be 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.570
 what are they going to do for the game or in their 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.190
 official date compared to the beta 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.500
 another thing that I did not like about the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.600
 beta is to feel that they killed me every one 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.670
 shot two shots apparently it's a bus that 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.650
 already going to be corrected and also the 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.140
 number of people called in English 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.910
 drive hearts is to say all those who 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.370
 they use the best classes the best of 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.960
 the best the best in the beta why not 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.760
 try the other things is the beta 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.440
 You use the not only is 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.120
 win for your progress will leave and leave 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.490
 to hell after this use 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.280
 have fun but only using what 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.590
 more over mighty have ended up being with 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.030
 bursts I would also have liked to be able to 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.580
 use commander mode though 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.860
 only was restricted to the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.860
 taiz servers and only for the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.900
 players of your company it seems to me that 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.500
 being a relatively characteristic 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.540
 new 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.460
 It would have seemed good to try it before 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.710
 to get it out in the official game and think 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.860
 suddenly I fucked up I went to 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.630
 change everything from the commander mode towards 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.280
 something that I did not like or towards what 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.680
 now the players are claiming me 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.450
 enjoyed rain more than they will taste it and 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.820
 maybe in the trial and error during the 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.520
 beta finally the ugly of the beta in 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.070
 general starting with the pennant that goes 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.840
 towards the front the lag and the performance in 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.220
 the particular thing I did not feel so bad or not 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.190
 I had so many problems with performance 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.020
 the computer but I had several several 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.430
 messages several people coming to me and 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.080
 telling me how they could play that neither 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.180
 they could not even play that stays in 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.740
 white loading that they had ten pictures 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.710
 every second all of a sudden 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.100
 they were in 120 and then 20 20 frames by 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.750
 second 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.030
 fortunately that will be corrected 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.000
 but it was not a good thing about the beta 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.620
 but above all the dust was ugly 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.570
 steel in shanghai after throwing the 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.130
 tower seems too exaggerated I think 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.050
 that will combine the entire amount of 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.030
 dust and they looked like bricks would be a 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.650
 much bigger skyscraper would have me 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.080
 liked that the map in general is not 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.030
 will affect both even within the 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.780
 elevators out of nowhere is already affected 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.300
 I understand that life 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.860
 and there would be too much dust and everything but 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.260
 as a player of a video game you are looking for 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.030
 have a good quality textures when 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.310
 less in the graphic part in your tastes 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.160
 graphics and that was something that formally 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.870
 it looked like a game not last 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.990
 generation after the dust fell 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.450
 everywhere 2 the ugly 3 rather it's already 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.040
 says in day I'm crazy this 3 the various 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.450
 packs or the start of whatever in 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.580
 microtransactions by which 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.550
 you can pay to have things 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.919
 Cosmetics apparently I'm not 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.590
 agreement with the fact of paying to have 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.360
 some things because you sincerely have 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.730
 a premium has is a base game and already 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.400
 you have almost 100 dollars spent on a 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:35.530
 game in this case at least they will be 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.940
 only cosmetics and they will have the 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.370
 opportunity to unlock them too 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.860
 as they rise in level is the point 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.300
 good but in general it is a bad 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.130
 incursion of what would be the 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.260
 microtransactions in games that by 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.180
 yes they are expensive and triple type 'a' and 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.220
 well that would be the good the bad and what 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.479
 ugly according to my opinion I hope that 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.700
 you liked the video and especially 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.590
 comment what you thought was good and bad 

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.270
 ugly you can give a grade to 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.650
 video and subscribe if they are new 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.930
 see here the channel 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.190
 so that they compensate in such case and 

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.570
 some videos that you have not seen in the 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.639
 next interactive screen the networks 

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.540
 social are in the description we 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.540
 we see in the next 

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.290
