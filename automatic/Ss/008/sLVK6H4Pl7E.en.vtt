hey guys this eric here at the warehouse

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.019 
hey guys this eric here at the warehouse
and<00:00:05.950> today<00:00:06.310> we're<00:00:06.430> going<00:00:06.520> to<00:00:06.580> go<00:00:06.729> over<00:00:06.760> the

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
and today we're going to go over the

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.450 
and today we're going to go over the
mission<00:00:07.359> commander<00:00:07.840> goalie<00:00:08.080> leg<00:00:08.320> pads<00:00:08.620> using

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
mission commander goalie leg pads using

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.980 
mission commander goalie leg pads using
me<00:00:09.550> pretty<00:00:09.790> similar<00:00:10.179> to<00:00:10.210> the<00:00:10.420> soldier<00:00:10.809> leg

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
me pretty similar to the soldier leg

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.230 
me pretty similar to the soldier leg
pads<00:00:11.230> but<00:00:11.469> that<00:00:12.009> actually<00:00:12.549> beefed<00:00:12.820> up<00:00:13.030> the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
pads but that actually beefed up the

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.579 
pads but that actually beefed up the
foam<00:00:13.480> in<00:00:13.629> here<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:13.839> lot<00:00:13.959> more<00:00:14.169> so<00:00:14.349> it's<00:00:14.440> going<00:00:14.530> to

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
foam in here a lot more so it's going to

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.040 
foam in here a lot more so it's going to
be<00:00:14.679> a<00:00:14.709> nice<00:00:14.919> strong<00:00:15.669> foam<00:00:16.030> in<00:00:16.209> there<00:00:16.360> and<00:00:16.570> also

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
be a nice strong foam in there and also

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.450 
be a nice strong foam in there and also
they've<00:00:17.380> enhanced<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:18.100> leathers<00:00:18.430> that

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
they've enhanced the leathers that

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.100 
they've enhanced the leathers that
they're<00:00:18.730> using<00:00:18.970> on<00:00:19.090> here<00:00:19.330> you<00:00:19.750> had<00:00:19.870> a<00:00:19.900> really

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
leg pads and you're still going to have

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.890 
leg pads and you're still going to have
missions<00:00:27.280> regulated<00:00:27.880> flex<00:00:28.180> on<00:00:28.360> here<00:00:28.570> shooting

when<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.270> are<00:00:34.390> playing<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.930> then<00:00:35.559> also<00:00:35.769> that

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
when you are playing and then also that

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.889 
when you are playing and then also that
outer<00:00:36.579> roles<00:00:36.879> can<00:00:37.030> be<00:00:37.089> a<00:00:37.149> nice<00:00:37.300> square<00:00:37.690> design

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
outer roles can be a nice square design

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.270 
outer roles can be a nice square design
is<00:00:38.230> going<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.410> help<00:00:38.559> control<00:00:38.920> some<00:00:38.949> of<00:00:39.160> those

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
is going to help control some of those

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.160 
is going to help control some of those
rebounds<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:39.850> then<00:00:40.629> going<00:00:40.809> on<00:00:40.929> to<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
rebounds and then going on to the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.389 
rebounds and then going on to the
integral<00:00:41.440> here<00:00:41.829> you're<00:00:42.039> going<00:00:42.159> to<00:00:42.219> notice

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
integral here you're going to notice

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.819 
integral here you're going to notice
it's<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.789> real<00:00:42.969> flat<00:00:43.359> design<00:00:43.749> it's<00:00:44.620> going<00:00:44.769> to

it's a real flat design it's going to

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.529 
it's a real flat design it's going to
have<00:00:45.010> this<00:00:45.190> piece<00:00:45.609> down<00:00:46.059> here<00:00:46.300> that's<00:00:46.420> going

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
have this piece down here that's going

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.869 
have this piece down here that's going
to<00:00:46.629> be<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.749> nice<00:00:46.929> real<00:00:47.469> rigid<00:00:47.679> foam<00:00:48.159> it's<00:00:48.730> going

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
to be a nice real rigid foam it's going

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.399 
to be a nice real rigid foam it's going
to<00:00:48.909> really<00:00:49.120> protect<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.659> inside<00:00:49.989> part<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
to really protect the inside part of the

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
leg from any shots that might go to the

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.569 
leg from any shots that might go to the
five<00:00:52.420> hole<00:00:52.659> and<00:00:52.899> just<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:53.980> real<00:00:54.309> flat

puck slipping through underneath and you

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.290 
puck slipping through underneath and you
also<00:01:02.769> have<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.219> additional<00:01:03.489> piece<00:01:03.940> right<00:01:04.150> up

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
also have this additional piece right up

side of the leg pads down here at the
bottom<00:01:10.869> of<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.890> boot<00:01:12.070> you're<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.490> see

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
bottom of the boot you're going to see

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.850 
bottom of the boot you're going to see
they're<00:01:12.820> using<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.320> high-grade<00:01:14.320> synthetic

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
they're using that high-grade synthetic

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.959 
they're using that high-grade synthetic
leather<00:01:15.070> there<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:15.549> you're<00:01:15.670> going<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.880> get

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
leather there so you're going to get

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.580 
leather there so you're going to get
some<00:01:16.149> really<00:01:16.360> good<00:01:16.479> durability<00:01:16.869> on<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.320> high

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
some really good durability on the high

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.590 
some really good durability on the high
where<00:01:17.920> zone<00:01:18.219> and<00:01:18.490> then<00:01:19.030> if<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.240> go<00:01:19.360> up<00:01:19.479> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
where zone and then if you go up a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.880 
where zone and then if you go up a
little<00:01:19.719> bit<00:01:19.899> farther<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.439> leg<00:01:20.619> pads

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
little bit farther in the leg pads

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.170 
little bit farther in the leg pads
you're<00:01:21.460> going<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.670> see<00:01:21.759> they<00:01:21.880> have<00:01:22.030> that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
you're going to see they have that

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.029 
you're going to see they have that
heavy-duty<00:01:22.509> nylon<00:01:22.840> material<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> leg

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039
