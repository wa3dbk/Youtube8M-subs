00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.170
 make an orange sponge cake take note 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.240

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.610
 juice 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.030
 70 milliliters of olive oil a 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.800
 natural yogurt sweetened 3 eggs 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.680

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.170
 250 grams of sugar 200 grams of 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.739
 flour and with this we are going to do the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 Biscuit 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.030
 At first we have beaten the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.230
 eggs with olive oil or sunflower 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.790
 and we are going to add the yogurt 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.790
 and we continue beating 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 we have mixed the ingredients we have 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.170
 thrown sugar is all 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 perfectly integrated and we are going to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.430
 start to peel 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.070
 take a normal grater 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.780
 and we're scratching all the orange so that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.780
 release the flavor 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.880
 As I said, it's a very tasty cake 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.330
 simple and basic so we've already 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.330
 cast the peel of the orange we're going to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.350
 add the yeast spoonful and let's 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.350
 to continue beating 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.290
 the dough is already ready with the flour and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 you see here more or less the texture say you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.730
 now we are in season of strawberries that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.470
 if you get some strawberries and those made in 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.630
 the dough will be much, much better 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.900
 the cake but otherwise it would be 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.900
 cool 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.700
 it's already in the mold so now we're going 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.280
 to put it in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.380
