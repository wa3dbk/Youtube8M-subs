00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
by side in the early days in Daytona USA

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.380 
by side in the early days in Daytona USA
and<00:00:40.110> since<00:00:40.650> then<00:00:40.860> we've<00:00:41.309> been<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.519> team<00:00:41.610> we

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and since then we've been a team we

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.780 
and since then we've been a team we
constantly<00:00:42.690> ask<00:00:43.170> ourselves<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.890> question<00:00:43.920> in

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
constantly ask ourselves the question in

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.270 
constantly ask ourselves the question in
combat<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.839> feels<00:00:46.110> good<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.769> does<00:00:46.949> it<00:00:47.070> feel

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
combat what feels good how does it feel

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.160 
combat what feels good how does it feel
and<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.089> response<00:00:48.300> has<00:00:48.690> changed

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and I think the response has changed

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
and I think the response has changed
over<00:00:49.379> time<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.920> put<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.160> simply<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.789> want<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
over time to put it simply we want the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
over time to put it simply we want the
player<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> feel<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.199> characters<00:00:52.649> paying<00:00:53.129> for

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
player to feel the characters paying for

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
player to feel the characters paying for
example<00:00:54.000> when<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.840> roundhouse<00:00:55.350> kick

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
example when you do a roundhouse kick

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.759 
example when you do a roundhouse kick
your<00:00:56.039> opponent<00:00:56.579> goes<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.239> air<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.079> body<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
your opponent goes in air that body is

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.130 
your opponent goes in air that body is
pretty<00:00:59.430> messed<00:00:59.789> up<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.269> its<00:01:00.449> face<00:01:00.719> looking

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
pretty messed up with its face looking

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.139 
pretty messed up with its face looking
one<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.129> body<00:01:02.370> facing<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> other

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
one way and the body facing the other

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.090 
one way and the body facing the other
direction<00:01:03.269> in<00:01:03.899> real<00:01:04.140> life<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.800> would<00:01:04.920> never

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
direction in real life that would never

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.980 
direction in real life that would never
happen<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.910> were<00:01:06.060> convinced<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.750> those

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
happen we were convinced that those

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
happen we were convinced that those
motions<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.950> enhance<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.550> overall

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
motions would enhance the overall

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.150 
motions would enhance the overall
experience<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.990> increase<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.800> level<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
experience and increase the level of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.550 
experience and increase the level of
satisfaction<00:01:11.399> when<00:01:12.000> playing<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
satisfaction when playing that was and

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
satisfaction when playing that was and
still<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.039> important<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.940> us<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.810> time

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
still is important to us at the time

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.710 
still is important to us at the time
when<00:01:16.259> developing<00:01:16.860> vf1<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.300> number<00:01:18.600> of

polygons were able to use was very

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
polygons were able to use was very
limited<00:01:20.910> I<00:01:21.360> mean<00:01:21.780> compared<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.439> what's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
limited I mean compared to what's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.399 
limited I mean compared to what's
possible<00:01:23.189> today<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.150> foundation<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:24.930> very

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
possible today the foundation was very

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.830 
possible today the foundation was very
poorly<00:01:25.770> made<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:27.060> our<00:01:27.150> challenge<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
poorly made but our challenge was to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.710 
poorly made but our challenge was to
create<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.500> realistic<00:01:29.009> human<00:01:29.790> life<00:01:30.150> character

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
create a realistic human life character

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.990 
create a realistic human life character
and<00:01:30.930> used<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> most<00:01:32.040> amount<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> polygons

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and used the most amount of polygons

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.890 
and used the most amount of polygons
ever<00:01:33.270> used<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> game<00:01:33.899> at<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> time

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900

before a cure existed I was working on a

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.660 
before a cure existed I was working on a
character<00:01:40.420> called<00:01:40.630> seba<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.320> liked<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.160> he<00:01:42.520> had

a very unique look then one day seba
disappeared<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.180> he<00:01:46.330> was<00:01:46.450> replaced<00:01:46.840> by<00:01:46.960> this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
disappeared and he was replaced by this

the characters cool and finally the main
concept<00:02:12.340> behind<00:02:12.430> vf3<00:02:12.940> was<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.570> have<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
concept behind vf3 was to have the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.870 
concept behind vf3 was to have the
players<00:02:14.140> move<00:02:14.500> around<00:02:14.739> freely<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.520> three

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
players move around freely in the three

you<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.459> allow<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.090> move<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.810> via<00:02:20.170> for<00:02:20.560> we

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
you to allow for that move in via for we

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.040 
you to allow for that move in via for we
ended<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.520> assigning<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> joystick

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
ended up assigning that to the joystick

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.470 
ended up assigning that to the joystick
instead<00:02:23.500> adding<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.340> fourth<00:02:24.670> button<00:02:24.970> was<00:02:25.209> fun

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
instead adding the fourth button was fun

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.090 
instead adding the fourth button was fun
in<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.660> way<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:25.900> was<00:02:26.350> still<00:02:26.530> pretty<00:02:26.800> difficult

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
in a way but was still pretty difficult

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.520 
in a way but was still pretty difficult
for<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.580> players<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.120> handle<00:02:28.510> big<00:02:28.750> reveal<00:02:29.080> we

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
for the players to handle big reveal we

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.620 
for the players to handle big reveal we
came<00:02:29.800> up<00:02:29.830> with<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> tug-of-war<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:31.090> mechanic

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
came up with a tug-of-war like mechanic

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.510 
came up with a tug-of-war like mechanic
where<00:02:31.900> two<00:02:32.230> characters<00:02:32.860> would<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.070> linked

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
where two characters would be linked

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.390 
where two characters would be linked
together<00:02:33.640> at<00:02:34.030> their<00:02:34.180> wrist<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:35.290> example<00:02:35.770> when

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
together at their wrist for example when

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400 
together at their wrist for example when
they're<00:02:36.550> far<00:02:36.820> apart<00:02:36.940> one<00:02:37.690> would<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.020> able<00:02:38.050> to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
they're far apart one would be able to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.140 
they're far apart one would be able to
snatch<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:38.980> other<00:02:39.250> or<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.580> would<00:02:39.820> shoot

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
snatch up the other or you would shoot

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.120 
snatch up the other or you would shoot
your<00:02:40.390> opponent<00:02:40.900> up<00:02:41.049> in<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.320> air<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:41.980> actually

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
your opponent up in the air we actually

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.310 
your opponent up in the air we actually
spent<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.790> significant<00:02:43.420> amount<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.750> time<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
spent a significant amount of time and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.400 
spent a significant amount of time and
worked<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.640> didn't<00:02:45.940> make<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.209> cut

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
worked on it but it didn't make the cut

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.930 
worked on it but it didn't make the cut
one<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.590> reasons<00:02:47.799> why<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:48.340> didn't<00:02:48.670> include

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
one of the reasons why we didn't include

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.310 
one of the reasons why we didn't include
Takahashi<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:50.170> via<00:02:50.440> for<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> motion<00:02:51.640> system

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
Takahashi in via for as a motion system

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.110 
Takahashi in via for as a motion system
we<00:02:53.320> simply<00:02:53.799> weren't<00:02:53.980> able<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.430> express<00:02:54.850> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
we simply weren't able to express the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
we simply weren't able to express the
character<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.870> ideal<00:02:56.170> manner<00:02:56.670> another

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
character in the ideal manner another

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670 
character in the ideal manner another
reason<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.360> were<00:02:58.510> pushing<00:02:58.840> overall<00:02:59.380> for<00:02:59.650> a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
reason is we were pushing overall for a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.490 
reason is we were pushing overall for a
fast<00:03:00.040> paced<00:03:00.400> speedy<00:03:01.060> game<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.690> via<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:02.290> and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
fast paced speedy game for via for and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.289 
fast paced speedy game for via for and
his<00:03:02.620> character<00:03:03.250> due<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.610> his<00:03:03.730> size<00:03:04.000> and

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
his character due to his size and

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.509 
his character due to his size and
movement<00:03:04.720> felt<00:03:04.959> somewhat<00:03:05.380> out<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> place<00:03:05.860> we

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
movement felt somewhat out of place we

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.240 
movement felt somewhat out of place we
added<00:03:06.730> him<00:03:07.000> back<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.510> vf5<00:03:08.080> our<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.709> by<00:03:09.070> that

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
added him back in vf5 our and by that

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.820 
added him back in vf5 our and by that
time<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:10.120> technology<00:03:10.750> we<00:03:10.900> had<00:03:11.080> supported<00:03:11.739> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
time the technology we had supported the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.910 
time the technology we had supported the
motion<00:03:12.220> we<00:03:12.370> wanted<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.730> express<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.560> kind<00:03:14.830> of

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
motion we wanted to express so kind of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.190 
motion we wanted to express so kind of
like<00:03:15.040> what<00:03:15.250> i<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.519> here<00:03:15.730> like<00:03:16.360> chubby<00:03:16.840> belly

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
like what i have here like chubby belly

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.020 
like what i have here like chubby belly
and<00:03:17.440> whatnot<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:18.400> were<00:03:18.519> able<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.850> create

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
and whatnot we were able to create

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.940 
and whatnot we were able to create
better<00:03:19.420> movement<00:03:19.810> for<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.290> large<00:03:20.590> size

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
better movement for this large size

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.670 
better movement for this large size

was<00:03:33.100> expressed<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:34.480> created<00:03:34.959> his<00:03:35.140> own

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
was expressed and we created his own

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.160 
was expressed and we created his own

can't think of anything where I felt so

can't think of anything where I felt so

which ones fit the game with characters
and<00:04:17.660> stages<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.620> don't<00:04:18.860> think<00:04:18.920> we<00:04:19.160> stressed<00:04:19.520> too

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
and stages I don't think we stressed too

pretty straightforward process in the
