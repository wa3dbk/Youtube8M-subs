00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
string so for example I'm going to use

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.020 
string so for example I'm going to use
this<00:01:12.170> exercise<00:01:12.679> today<00:01:12.830> we're<00:01:13.580> going<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.880> use

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
this exercise today we're going to use

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.719 
this exercise today we're going to use
the<00:01:14.660> twelfth<00:01:14.990> fret<00:01:15.310> we're<00:01:16.310> not<00:01:16.429> going<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.640> have

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the twelfth fret we're not going to have

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.210 
the twelfth fret we're not going to have
a<00:01:16.759> tab<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.929> not<00:01:18.170> really<00:01:18.590> needed<00:01:18.770> we're<00:01:19.069> just

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
a tab is not really needed we're just

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.710 
a tab is not really needed we're just
going<00:01:19.459> to<00:01:19.490> use<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.640> couple<00:01:19.819> of<00:01:19.940> frets<00:01:20.149> so<00:01:20.360> just

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
follow me here fret 12 on the third

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.010 
follow me here fret 12 on the third
string<00:01:25.190> that's<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.580> G<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:29.690> we're<00:01:29.810> going<00:01:29.959> to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
string that's a G and we're going to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.810 
string that's a G and we're going to
bend<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.709> up<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.160> a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.950 

it's<00:01:35.820> important<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it's important that you you know you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.750 
it's important that you you know you
tune<00:01:37.230> up<00:01:37.380> first<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.250> make<00:01:38.370> sure<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
tune up first just to make sure that

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.290 
tune up first just to make sure that
both<00:01:38.940> strings<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:40.200> tune<00:01:40.460> now<00:01:41.460> while<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.180> do

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
both strings are in tune now while we do

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.390 
both strings are in tune now while we do
this<00:01:42.510> with<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:43.050> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.350> press<00:01:43.650> with

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
this with actually going to press with

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.660 
this with actually going to press with
the<00:01:44.490> first<00:01:44.729> finger<00:01:45.290> fret<00:01:46.290> 10<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.340> second

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the first finger fret 10 on the second

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.090 
the first finger fret 10 on the second
string<00:01:47.910> that's<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:48.690> A<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.620> so<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.800> idea

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
string that's also an A and so the idea

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.710 
string that's also an A and so the idea
here<00:01:50.160> is<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.670> fret<00:01:51.270> 12<00:01:51.420> slowly<00:01:52.140> rises<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.160> to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
here is that fret 12 slowly rises up to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
here is that fret 12 slowly rises up to
the<00:01:54.720> sound<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.080> fret<00:01:55.260> 14<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.490> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the sound of fret 14 which is which is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.060 
the sound of fret 14 which is which is
an<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.360> while<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:59.690> pick<00:02:00.690> an<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.680> second

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
an a while we pick an a on the second

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.479 
an a while we pick an a on the second
string<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> sounds<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:07.399> when<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
string and it sounds like this when you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.750 
string and it sounds like this when you
get<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:10.020> actually<00:02:10.140> hear<00:02:10.560> almost<00:02:11.009> one

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
get there you actually hear almost one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.660 
get there you actually hear almost one
note<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.480> sounds<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.530> lot<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.160> lot<00:02:14.400> fatter

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
note but it sounds a lot a lot fatter

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.420 
note but it sounds a lot a lot fatter
than<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.420> single<00:02:15.780> one<00:02:16.020> hear<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> again<00:02:19.430> I'm

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
than the single one hear it again I'm

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.059 
than the single one hear it again I'm
going<00:02:20.790> both<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.239> them

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
going both of them

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.300 
going both of them
and<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:23.939> can<00:02:24.090> go<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.840> two<00:02:25.170> G<00:02:25.379> alright<00:02:26.129> so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and I can go back to do two G alright so

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.250 
and I can go back to do two G alright so
the<00:02:26.610> idea<00:02:27.030> here<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.359> that<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.659> actually<00:02:27.750> get

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the idea here is that you actually get

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.490 
the idea here is that you actually get
as<00:02:28.409> close<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.650> possible<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:29.340> both<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.150> both<00:02:30.500> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
as close as possible to both to both to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.259 
as close as possible to both to both to
the<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.859> actual<00:02:32.099> node<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.579> both<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:33.090> your

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
the to the actual node with both of your

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.500 
the to the actual node with both of your
fingers<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:35.280> easy<00:02:35.519> way<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.790> figure<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.150> out<00:02:36.269> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
fingers one easy way to figure it out is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.270 
fingers one easy way to figure it out is
if<00:02:36.810> when<00:02:37.109> you're<00:02:37.200> bending<00:02:37.409> you'll<00:02:37.829> hear<00:02:38.129> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
if when you're bending you'll hear the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.339 
if when you're bending you'll hear the
vibration<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.909> strings<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.599> most<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.260> you

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
vibration of the strings as most of you

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.539 
vibration of the strings as most of you
know<00:02:40.409> nodes<00:02:41.370> are<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.150> simple<00:02:42.569> matter<00:02:43.349> of

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
know nodes are just a simple matter of

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.759 
know nodes are just a simple matter of
frequency<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.599> sound<00:02:45.840> wave<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.650> if

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
frequency of the of the sound wave so if

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.770 
frequency of the of the sound wave so if
we're<00:02:46.950> playing<00:02:47.189> a<00:02:47.430> low<00:02:47.790> note<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.359> sound<00:02:48.599> wave

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
we're playing a low note the sound wave

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.410 
we're playing a low note the sound wave
is<00:02:49.200> slower<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.159> will<00:02:50.340> hear<00:02:50.459> Peaks<00:02:50.760> very

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
is slower so you will hear Peaks very

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.280 
is slower so you will hear Peaks very
very<00:02:52.310> separated<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.109> get

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
very separated and then as you get

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.770 
very separated and then as you get
higher<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.040> higher<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.400> pitch<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:57.239> frequency

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
higher and higher in pitch the frequency

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.629 
higher and higher in pitch the frequency
speeds<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.889> then<00:02:59.040> you'll<00:02:59.159> hear<00:02:59.370> more

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
speeds up and then you'll hear more

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.000 
speeds up and then you'll hear more
peaks<00:03:00.060> now<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.049> compare<00:03:01.260> those<00:03:01.650> two

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
peaks now when you compare those two

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.379 
peaks now when you compare those two
notes<00:03:02.189> and<00:03:02.549> you're<00:03:02.819> doing<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.209> when<00:03:03.359> you're

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
notes and you're doing that when you're

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.250 
notes and you're doing that when you're
bending<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.790> difference<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.389> frequency<00:03:06.419> will

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
bending the difference in frequency will

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.199 
bending the difference in frequency will
produce<00:03:07.609> vibration<00:03:08.609> here<00:03:08.970> let<00:03:09.150> me

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
produce vibration here let me

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.449 
produce vibration here let me
demonstrate<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.689> for<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.139> here<00:03:10.919> now<00:03:11.189> you'll

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
demonstrate it for you here now you'll

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.379 
demonstrate it for you here now you'll
hear<00:03:11.669> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:11.909> of<00:03:11.939> vibration

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.650 

yes<00:03:15.389> slower

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.720 

but<00:03:19.660> as<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.900> go<00:03:20.050> farther<00:03:20.440> away<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:21.130> speeds<00:03:21.550> up

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
but as I go farther away it speeds up

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.130 
but as I go farther away it speeds up
again<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.240> just<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.600> find<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.960> sweet

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
again so you just have to find a sweet

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.640 
again so you just have to find a sweet
spot<00:03:23.200> where<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:23.860> vibration<00:03:24.280> stops

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.330 

now<00:03:30.610> they<00:03:30.849> are<00:03:30.909> in<00:03:31.090> June<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:32.159> that's<00:03:33.159> pretty

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
now they are in June so that's pretty

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.339 
now they are in June so that's pretty
simple<00:03:33.610> I'm<00:03:33.790> gonna<00:03:33.940> have<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> close<00:03:34.330> up<00:03:34.360> real

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
simple I'm gonna have a close up real

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.320 
simple I'm gonna have a close up real
soon<00:03:35.620> but<00:03:35.890> first<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:36.370> want<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.640> show<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:36.909> the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
soon but first I want to show you the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.410 
soon but first I want to show you the
same<00:03:37.540> thing<00:03:37.569> with<00:03:38.409> with<00:03:39.190> my<00:03:39.370> signature<00:03:39.970> guitar

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
same thing with with my signature guitar

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.000 
same thing with with my signature guitar
which<00:03:40.599> is<00:03:40.780> which<00:03:41.019> has<00:03:41.230> our<00:03:41.440> faces<00:03:41.680> an<00:03:41.890> old

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
which is which has our faces an old

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.130 
which is which has our faces an old
Gibson<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.299> has<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:45.610> fixed<00:03:46.329> bridge<00:03:46.599> so<00:03:47.110> you

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
Gibson and it has a fixed bridge so you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.420 
Gibson and it has a fixed bridge so you
will<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.409> no<00:03:47.560> problem<00:03:47.829> with<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.129> can

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
will have no problem with this you can

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.430 
will have no problem with this you can
bend<00:03:48.700> one<00:03:48.940> note<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.599> next<00:03:49.840> one<00:03:49.989> will<00:03:50.170> stay

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
bend one note and the next one will stay

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.100 
bend one note and the next one will stay
in<00:03:50.590> tune<00:03:50.799> but<00:03:51.549> let<00:03:52.150> me<00:03:52.239> switch<00:03:52.420> guitars<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.019> we

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
in tune but let me switch guitars and we

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.680 
in tune but let me switch guitars and we
look<00:03:53.290> at<00:03:53.470> tremolo<00:03:54.190> bridges<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.329> how<00:03:55.540> they

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
look at tremolo bridges and see how they

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.160 
look at tremolo bridges and see how they
work<00:03:56.849> all<00:03:57.849> right<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.390> attire<00:03:58.720> as<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.019> can

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
work all right so this attire as you can

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.160 
work all right so this attire as you can
see<00:03:59.319> has<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.560> floating<00:03:59.860> bridge<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
see has a floating bridge and the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.809 
see has a floating bridge and the
problem<00:04:02.470> with<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.650> one<00:04:02.859> is<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.640> bridge

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
problem with this one is that the bridge

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.780 
problem with this one is that the bridge
stays<00:04:04.739> keep<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.859> strings<00:04:06.099> in<00:04:06.250> tune<00:04:06.280> because

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
stays keep the strings in tune because

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.880 
stays keep the strings in tune because
it's<00:04:07.090> it's<00:04:07.329> balanced<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:07.959> have<00:04:08.200> enough

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
it's it's balanced so you have enough

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.670 
it's it's balanced so you have enough
pull<00:04:09.190> on<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> back<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.260> bridge<00:04:11.410> here

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
pull on in the back of the bridge here

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.380 
pull on in the back of the bridge here
there<00:04:11.890> are<00:04:12.010> there<00:04:12.430> are<00:04:12.459> three<00:04:12.730> Springs<00:04:13.120> and

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
there are there are three Springs and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.960 
there are there are three Springs and
they<00:04:13.989> hold<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.319> bridge<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.620> place<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.129> the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
they hold the bridge in place and the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.759 
they hold the bridge in place and the
potential<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.510> Springs<00:04:16.840> matches<00:04:17.650> the

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
potential of the Springs matches the

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.620 
potential of the Springs matches the
tension<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> strings<00:04:18.519> now<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.209> problem

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
tension of the strings now the problem

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.849 
tension of the strings now the problem
is<00:04:19.660> when<00:04:19.870> you're<00:04:19.989> bending<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.470> note<00:04:20.650> you're

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
is when you're bending a note you're

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.980 
is when you're bending a note you're
actually<00:04:21.300> considering<00:04:22.300> you're<00:04:22.630> actually

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
actually considering you're actually

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.920 
actually considering you're actually
pulling<00:04:23.770> on<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.789> maintain<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.660> the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
pulling on it and so I maintain the the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.689 
pulling on it and so I maintain the the
tension<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:29.680> other<00:04:29.830> strings<00:04:30.220> will<00:04:30.400> fall

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
tension is the other strings will fall

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.750 
tension is the other strings will fall
flat<00:04:30.880> okay<00:04:31.720> because<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.260> bridge<00:04:32.500> will<00:04:33.490> move

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
flat okay because the bridge will move

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.820 
flat okay because the bridge will move
forward<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.050> if<00:04:35.169> you<00:04:35.260> actually<00:04:35.380> listen<00:04:35.800> to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
forward so if you actually listen to

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.490 
forward so if you actually listen to
what<00:04:35.979> I'm<00:04:36.250> doing<00:04:36.280> now<00:04:36.580> if<00:04:36.880> I'm<00:04:37.030> playing<00:04:37.500> twelve

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
what I'm doing now if I'm playing twelve

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.700 
what I'm doing now if I'm playing twelve
and<00:04:38.860> twelve<00:04:39.490> on<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.389> third<00:04:40.599> string<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.110> tied

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
and twelve on the third string and tied

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.469 
and twelve on the third string and tied
on<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.889> second<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.250> we<00:04:42.310> did<00:04:42.460> before

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.390 

within<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.570> guitar<00:04:46.900> but<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.500> note<00:04:47.740> will<00:04:48.190> not

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
within the guitar but this note will not

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.610 
within the guitar but this note will not
be<00:04:48.639> a<00:04:48.849> let<00:04:49.570> me<00:04:49.599> demonstrate<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:50.200> again<00:04:50.500> I'm

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
be a let me demonstrate this again I'm

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.500 
be a let me demonstrate this again I'm
going<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.830> play<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.669> tenth<00:04:51.910> fret<00:04:52.210> on<00:04:52.389> the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
going to play the tenth fret on the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.659 
going to play the tenth fret on the
second<00:04:52.930> string<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.260> at<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.500> same<00:04:53.650> time<00:04:53.919> on

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
second string and at the same time on

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.159 
second string and at the same time on
the<00:04:54.820> third<00:04:55.000> string<00:04:55.330> listen<00:04:55.690> how<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.810> note

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
the third string listen how the note

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.989 
the third string listen how the note
goes<00:04:56.200> down

00:04:59.989 --> 00:04:59.999 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:05.040 

see<00:05:00.999> so<00:05:01.779> what<00:05:01.929> I<00:05:01.959> meant<00:05:02.259> miss<00:05:02.529> not<00:05:03.629> to<00:05:04.629> have<00:05:04.749> to

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
see so what I meant miss not to have to

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.040 
see so what I meant miss not to have to
a<00:05:05.080> grenade<00:05:05.709> the<00:05:06.580> one<00:05:06.789> that<00:05:06.939> fingering<00:05:07.479> on<00:05:07.719> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
a grenade the one that fingering on the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.959 
a grenade the one that fingering on the
second<00:05:08.529> struck<00:05:08.800> on<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:08.949> second<00:05:09.339> string<00:05:09.550> is

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
second struck on the second string is

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.029 
second struck on the second string is
not<00:05:10.270> actually<00:05:10.599> a<00:05:10.659> dating<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:11.740> if<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.889> have<00:05:12.009> a

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
not actually a dating so if you have a

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.169 
not actually a dating so if you have a
good<00:05:12.159> time<00:05:12.279> like<00:05:12.490> this<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.849> it's<00:05:12.999> set<00:05:13.149> up

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:13.179 
good time like this and it's set up

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.959 
good time like this and it's set up
quite<00:05:13.509> soft<00:05:13.869> like<00:05:14.259> mine<00:05:14.559> is<00:05:14.800> you'll<00:05:15.669> have<00:05:15.819> to

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
quite soft like mine is you'll have to

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.429 
quite soft like mine is you'll have to
make<00:05:16.089> up<00:05:16.240> for<00:05:16.509> that<00:05:16.539> so<00:05:17.229> go<00:05:17.559> up<00:05:17.589> to<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:19.439> listen

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
make up for that so go up to a listen

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:26.429 
make up for that so go up to a listen
for<00:05:20.619> this<00:05:20.740> sound<00:05:24.659> you<00:05:25.659> have<00:05:25.809> to<00:05:25.929> kind<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.199> move

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:26.439 
for this sound you have to kind of move

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.669 
for this sound you have to kind of move
this<00:05:26.770> note<00:05:27.629> restrain<00:05:28.629> the<00:05:28.779> second<00:05:29.080> one<00:05:29.229> to

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:29.679 
this note restrain the second one to

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.769 
this note restrain the second one to
match<00:05:29.889> what<00:05:30.159> you're<00:05:30.309> having<00:05:30.459> on<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.759> third

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.659 

now<00:05:34.779> I<00:05:34.809> was<00:05:35.110> in<00:05:35.229> tune<00:05:35.409> but<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:35.919> had<00:05:36.099> to<00:05:36.249> pull<00:05:36.519> the

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
now I was in tune but I had to pull the

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.980 
now I was in tune but I had to pull the
string<00:05:36.909> up<00:05:37.029> slightly

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
string up slightly

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.989 
string up slightly
alright<00:05:38.589> so<00:05:39.099> let<00:05:39.249> me<00:05:39.309> give<00:05:39.429> a<00:05:39.459> close-up<00:05:39.879> of

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:39.999 
alright so let me give a close-up of

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:41.759 
alright so let me give a close-up of
both<00:05:40.240> techniques<00:05:40.569> with<00:05:40.959> the<00:05:40.990> fixed<00:05:41.559> bridge

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:41.769 
both techniques with the fixed bridge

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:43.889 
both techniques with the fixed bridge
and<00:05:42.009> with<00:05:42.519> a<00:05:42.550> floating<00:05:42.849> bridge<00:05:43.029> and<00:05:43.360> then

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:43.899 
and with a floating bridge and then

00:05:43.899 --> 00:06:00.990 
and with a floating bridge and then
let's<00:05:44.379> say<00:05:44.469> then<00:05:44.619> you<00:05:44.679> can<00:05:44.800> go<00:05:44.889> practice

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.280 

all<00:06:02.000> right<00:06:02.150> so<00:06:02.300> as<00:06:02.420> you<00:06:02.510> can<00:06:02.630> see<00:06:02.870> it's<00:06:03.110> a

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
all right so as you can see it's a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.420 
all right so as you can see it's a
pretty<00:06:03.320> simple<00:06:03.620> technique<00:06:04.040> and<00:06:04.220> it's

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
pretty simple technique and it's

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.980 
pretty simple technique and it's
actually<00:06:04.700> really<00:06:04.820> useful<00:06:05.270> you<00:06:05.300> listen<00:06:05.780> you

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
actually really useful you listen you

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.900 
actually really useful you listen you
hear<00:06:06.230> it<00:06:06.380> in<00:06:06.650> a<00:06:06.920> lot<00:06:07.040> of<00:06:07.130> records<00:06:07.460> you<00:06:07.640> can<00:06:07.790> do<00:06:07.880> a

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
hear it in a lot of records you can do a

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.600 
hear it in a lot of records you can do a
clean<00:06:08.240> sound<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:08.960> distorted<00:06:09.800> sound<00:06:10.010> with

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
clean sound the distorted sound with

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.830 
clean sound the distorted sound with
distortion<00:06:11.030> is<00:06:11.090> a<00:06:11.150> little<00:06:11.450> bit<00:06:11.570> easier

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
distortion is a little bit easier

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.390 
distortion is a little bit easier
because<00:06:11.990> you<00:06:12.260> actually<00:06:12.530> hear<00:06:12.710> the<00:06:12.860> vibrations

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
because you actually hear the vibrations

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.820 
because you actually hear the vibrations
a<00:06:13.520> lot<00:06:13.640> more<00:06:13.910> so<00:06:14.570> I<00:06:14.600> suggest<00:06:14.990> maybe<00:06:15.140> put<00:06:15.800> a

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
a lot more so I suggest maybe put a

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.810 
a lot more so I suggest maybe put a
little<00:06:15.950> bit<00:06:16.070> of<00:06:16.190> distortion<00:06:16.310> I<00:06:16.580> don't<00:06:16.730> even

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
little bit of distortion I don't even

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.100 
little bit of distortion I don't even
know<00:06:16.970> what<00:06:17.120> kind<00:06:17.240> of<00:06:17.330> Sun<00:06:17.510> I'm<00:06:17.600> using<00:06:17.840> right

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
know what kind of Sun I'm using right

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.310 
know what kind of Sun I'm using right
now<00:06:18.310> it's<00:06:19.310> not<00:06:20.150> as<00:06:20.300> dirty<00:06:20.510> as<00:06:20.660> it<00:06:20.750> can<00:06:20.990> be<00:06:21.140> but
