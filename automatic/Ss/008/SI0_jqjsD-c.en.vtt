00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.629
 materials that we are going to use we are going to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.669
 use this vest that I have from here 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.100
 as a mold we are going to use a ribbon 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.590
 metric if we needed a rule let's 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.440
 to use scissor soap scissors and for 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.679
 course we are going to use this fabric that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.019
 I have here that is leather or leatherette 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:23.339
 of a skirt that I did not have left and I'm going 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.900
 recycle we will measure the vest 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.329
 on top of the canvas we are going to put it like this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.390
 bent to take out the two parts of 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:34.260
 in front as you see I am doing 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.600
 what is the mold marking with a soap 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.200
 disaster and leaving two centimeters to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.420
 the sewing is better to leave it a little 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 big to be narrow and then not 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 have a solution as you can see 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.670
 they are marking the whole silhouette of the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.630
 part of the front of the vest 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.580
 right now I'm cutting it 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.970
 let's also take advantage of the seams 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.070
 who has this skirt when doing 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.810
 what is the vest will be very 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.990
 well these positions are going to be as if 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.960
 would have been a vest totally post 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.540
 made to measure has done with patterns 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.550
 let's mark the other part of the vest 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.650
 from the front as in the same 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.080
 piece of cloth turning it towards the other 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.940
 side so that two sides are left 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.120
 different will not be left to us both 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.430
 equal sides and then we can not 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.930
 know them 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.140
 as you can see I'm putting 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.700
 well let's fabric and cut flush and 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.200
 that we have already cut with both 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.950
 centimeters that we had left from 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.950
 difference 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.159
 I'm not going on fast camera because 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.050
 it's faster and it does not work 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.880
 much 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.560
 in watching this video since everything is very 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.170
 easy to simply take the mold of a 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.190
 vest that you already have we already have both 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.190
 front parts 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.620
 the two sides are already ahead and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.620
 let's do the back 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.240
 now we put the vest open 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.819
 to be able to mark the back 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.700
 we're going to cut it with 2 centimeters 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.080
 of difference for the seam we're going 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.080
 to join to join the pieces 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.920
 two centimeters or one centimeter of 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.260
 transformation now I will do 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.390
 hem me because the hem on what 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.600
 which is the area of ​​the sleeves since it is 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.400
 a leather cloth and it's not going to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.770
 fray then what are we going to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.520
 do is cut it very rounded to 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.200
 it is for us a very clean cut 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 and you can see if leaving a 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.830
 centimeter of difference 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.830
 we already have the back 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.490
 and now we are going to cut so that it is 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.960
 well asymmetrical the sides bone that 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.790
 be well cut that we do not stay 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.660
 as if we do it with everything in zig zag 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.460
 we're going to fold the middle one so that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.460
 the two sides are the same 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.870
 now let's put the rights 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.190
 faced with the fabrics to be able 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.320
 sew 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.690
 you can put the machine or you can 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.930
 sew by hand and so you prefer not to 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.240
 you have sewing machine this is optional 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.020
 let's bake the sides of the sides 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.020
 of the vest 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.920
 I the part of behind like you 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.960
 can see I've left him shorter and the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.090
 part in front of the front 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.100
 of the vest leave it longer because 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.490
 because ahead is where I'm going to do the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.490
 fringes 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.360
 let's do the other side of alejo 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.360
 we already have the parts together 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.580
 and now let's mark to where 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.500
 we want the fringes cut 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.200
 let's go short with the scissors we're going to 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.570
 to cut it then of more or less less 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.209
 of a centimeter half a centimeter of 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.150
 width as finite as you can cut them 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.590
 so that it stays very thick in the part 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.590
 in front of the fringes like you 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.930
 can see I'm cutting the ones until the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.240
 line that back dry in this case the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.240
 saber soap and with the rule 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.720
 this process have to have a lot 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:24.230
 patience to do it very well that is 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.520
 a very very hard work done very 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.540
 well done it seems that you have 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.270
 bought a zara store for example 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.330
 so guys and girls take advantage of what 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.940
 have at home skirts of a ball 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.610
 from your mother your sister who no longer 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.140
 It's worth not having them take advantage of it 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.930
 this is how all the 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.370
 fringes 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.430
 as you can see I have taken advantage 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.330
 also from the lack of taken advantage of what 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.460
 which is the cut that I had already that's how 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.039
 they are very beautiful you can leave them like this 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.660
 If you want or we are going to see the 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.550
 next step that I have put some 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.250
 colored balls because I think that 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.350
 will be more prime spring candle and 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.340
 well I totally cowboy style how can 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.620
 see there and how can you see there 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.030
 the stroke that had the skirt makes very 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.410
 nice the front part of the vest 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.120
 the back is shorter now 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.699
 let's put the second option that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.090
 would be with the colored balls 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:28.020
 style a little cowboy but also a 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.639
 little bit as well as how Aztec here I am 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.229
 with my puppy to know that my puppy 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.850
 as well as that adam chávez with the post 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.550
 as you can see the back is more 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.960
 short and the fringes are very nice 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.490
 it looks like it's a pretty poor color 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.850
