I've<00:01:00.670> got<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.269> junction<00:01:01.900> box<00:01:02.140> from<00:01:02.589> an<00:01:02.710> old

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
I've got a junction box from an old

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.700 
I've got a junction box from an old
construction<00:01:03.549> project<00:01:04.059> left<00:01:04.330> over<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:05.379> I'm

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
construction project left over so I'm

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.850 
construction project left over so I'm
going<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.010> use<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.689> you<00:01:07.750> aren't<00:01:08.380> plugging

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
going to use that if you aren't plugging

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.390 
going to use that if you aren't plugging
into<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.369> GFI<00:01:10.049> receptacle<00:01:11.049> then<00:01:11.290> put<00:01:11.530> GFI<00:01:12.009> in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
into a GFI receptacle then put GFI in

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.789 
into a GFI receptacle then put GFI in
the<00:01:12.580> junction<00:01:13.000> box<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.110> power<00:01:14.320> comes<00:01:14.619> in

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
the junction box so the power comes in

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.490 
the junction box so the power comes in
it<00:01:14.979> goes<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> GFI<00:01:15.939> from<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.509> GFI<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:17.259> goes

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
it goes to the GFI from the GFI it goes

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.950 
it goes to the GFI from the GFI it goes
to<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.740> dimmer<00:01:17.950> switch<00:01:18.310> well<00:01:19.090> my<00:01:19.450> wife<00:01:19.600> didn't

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
to the dimmer switch well my wife didn't

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440 
to the dimmer switch well my wife didn't
like<00:01:19.990> dimmer<00:01:20.470> switches<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.490> old<00:01:21.729> style<00:01:22.149> that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
like dimmer switches the old style that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.020 
like dimmer switches the old style that
is<00:01:22.689> that<00:01:22.990> has<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.499> push<00:01:23.740> on<00:01:23.950> push<00:01:24.310> off<00:01:24.609> and<00:01:24.939> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
is that has the push on push off and the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.090 
is that has the push on push off and the
twist<00:01:25.329> to<00:01:25.479> control<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.990> power<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.859> I<00:01:26.920> had<00:01:27.039> a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
twist to control the power so I had a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.399 
twist to control the power so I had a
couple<00:01:27.249> of<00:01:27.429> these<00:01:27.520> laying<00:01:27.789> around<00:01:27.969> too<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.990> put

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
couple of these laying around too so put

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.200 
couple of these laying around too so put
that<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.890> junction<00:01:30.219> box<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.850> then<00:01:30.969> from

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
that in the junction box and then from

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.059 
that in the junction box and then from
there<00:01:31.450> when<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:31.719> come<00:01:32.020> out<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.380> cord<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:32.950> we're

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
there when I come out the cord and we're

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.069 
there when I come out the cord and we're
gonna<00:01:33.219> go<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.880> most<00:01:34.119> expensive<00:01:34.539> part<00:01:34.990> of

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
gonna go to the most expensive part of

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.160 
gonna go to the most expensive part of
this<00:01:35.229> whole<00:01:35.289> thing<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.999> got<00:01:36.999> this<00:01:37.210> from<00:01:37.450> Granger

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
this whole thing I got this from Granger

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.599 
this whole thing I got this from Granger
it's<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:39.210> step-down<00:01:40.210> power<00:01:41.340> transformer<00:01:42.340> you

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
it's a step-down power transformer you

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.459 
it's a step-down power transformer you
can<00:01:42.759> do<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.939> pause<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.569> get<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.840> number<00:01:44.109> off<00:01:44.140> of

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
can do a pause and get the number off of

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.800 
can do a pause and get the number off of
this<00:01:44.590> if<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.890> like<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.359> kind<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.689> neat

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
this if you like but it's kind of neat

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.410 
this if you like but it's kind of neat
because<00:01:47.079> it's<00:01:47.740> got<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> circuit<00:01:48.460> breaker<00:01:48.609> it's

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
because it's got a circuit breaker it's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.770 
because it's got a circuit breaker it's
gonna<00:01:49.600> step<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:49.990> volts<00:01:50.469> from<00:01:50.740> 120<00:01:51.700> down<00:01:51.999> to<00:01:52.179> 24

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
gonna step the volts from 120 down to 24

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.450 
gonna step the volts from 120 down to 24
volts<00:01:53.200> but<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.499> the<00:01:53.590> process<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.310> gonna

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
volts but in the process it's gonna

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.849 
volts but in the process it's gonna
create<00:01:55.359> a<00:01:55.450> lot<00:01:55.689> more<00:01:55.749> current<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.679> need

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
create a lot more current and we need

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.879 
create a lot more current and we need
the<00:01:57.009> current<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.490> heat<00:01:57.579> up<00:01:57.609> this<00:01:57.909> wire<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.409> the

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
the current to heat up this wire so the

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.309 
the current to heat up this wire so the
two<00:02:00.729> yellow<00:02:00.969> wires<00:02:01.299> here<00:02:01.689> coming<00:02:02.020> out<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.259> the

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
two yellow wires here coming out of the

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.859 
two yellow wires here coming out of the
transformer<00:02:03.039> then<00:02:03.249> are<00:02:03.369> going<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.639> go<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
transformer then are going to go to the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.070 
transformer then are going to go to the
alligator<00:02:05.380> clips<00:02:05.799> which<00:02:06.670> are<00:02:06.850> then<00:02:07.090> clicked

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
alligator clips which are then clicked

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.980

do is find the 25% poured location so in
this<00:04:07.159> case<00:04:07.400> 10<00:04:08.090> inch<00:04:08.269> cord<00:04:08.829> 25%<00:04:09.829> of<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.040> is

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
this case 10 inch cord 25% of that is

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.740 
this case 10 inch cord 25% of that is
two<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.549> half<00:04:10.700> inches<00:04:11.030> we<00:04:11.269> measure<00:04:11.450> back

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
two and a half inches we measure back

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.619 
two and a half inches we measure back
from<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.049> leading<00:04:12.500> edge<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.909> airfoil

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
from the leading edge of the airfoil

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.129 
from the leading edge of the airfoil
back<00:04:14.959> 25%<00:04:15.920> we<00:04:16.130> make<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> mark<00:04:16.609> we<00:04:17.599> do<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.930> same

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
back 25% we make a mark we do the same

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.349 
back 25% we make a mark we do the same
thing<00:04:18.470> down<00:04:18.709> at<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.919> other<00:04:19.070> end<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:20.150> phone

thing down at the other end of the phone
so<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.959> back<00:04:21.199> three<00:04:21.709> inches<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.460> we're

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
so this is back three inches so we're

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.310 
so this is back three inches so we're
going<00:04:22.729> to<00:04:22.789> make<00:04:22.940> another<00:04:23.270> mark<00:04:23.599> back<00:04:23.960> three

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
going to make another mark back three

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.719 
going to make another mark back three
inches<00:04:24.669> this<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:26.030> where<00:04:26.419> our<00:04:27.130> spar<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.490> going

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
inches this is where our spar is going

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.360 
inches this is where our spar is going
to<00:04:28.820> be<00:04:28.970> cut<00:04:29.479> into<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.410> wing<00:04:30.699> so<00:04:32.410> we<00:04:33.410> take<00:04:34.160> our

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
to be cut into the wing so we take our

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.180 
to be cut into the wing so we take our
raining<00:04:34.759> wire<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.419> we<00:04:35.630> line<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:35.930> up<00:04:36.229> we<00:04:36.979> line

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
raining wire and we line it up we line

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.760 
raining wire and we line it up we line
up<00:04:37.220> our<00:04:37.580> foam<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.539> that<00:04:38.570> we've<00:04:39.139> got<00:04:39.590> it

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
up our foam so that we've got it

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.439 
up our foam so that we've got it
straight<00:04:42.430> directly<00:04:43.430> under<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.940> rainy<00:04:44.150> wire

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
straight directly under the rainy wire

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.339 
straight directly under the rainy wire
and<00:04:44.900> then<00:04:45.789> we<00:04:46.789> come<00:04:47.090> up<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.539> the<00:04:47.660> leading<00:04:48.110> edge

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
and then we come up to the leading edge

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.670 
and then we come up to the leading edge
of<00:04:48.590> our<00:04:48.860> pattern<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.930> notice<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.349> it<00:04:51.500> hits

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
of our pattern and notice that it hits

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.800 
of our pattern and notice that it hits
right<00:04:52.010> on<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.340> black<00:04:52.580> line<00:04:53.000> here<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.599> if<00:04:53.659> we

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
right on the black line here and if we

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.589 
right on the black line here and if we
measure<00:04:54.050> that<00:04:54.349> distance<00:04:54.849> that<00:04:55.849> is<00:04:56.150> one<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:56.570> a

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
measure that distance that is one and a

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.550 
measure that distance that is one and a
quarter<00:04:56.960> inches<00:04:57.370> one<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.520> a<00:04:58.580> quarter<00:04:58.970> inches

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
quarter inches one and a quarter inches

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.250 
quarter inches one and a quarter inches
times<00:05:00.560> four<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.610> five<00:05:02.060> inches<00:05:02.659> so<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:02.900> means

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
times four is five inches so that means

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.550 
times four is five inches so that means
our<00:05:03.500> wingtip<00:05:04.159> will<00:05:04.460> be<00:05:04.610> five<00:05:04.970> inches<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.900> that

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
our wingtip will be five inches and that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.370 
our wingtip will be five inches and that
is<00:05:06.620> exactly<00:05:07.220> what<00:05:07.520> I<00:05:07.550> want<00:05:07.849> I<00:05:08.150> want<00:05:08.539> the<00:05:08.810> 50%

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
is exactly what I want I want the 50%

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.560 
is exactly what I want I want the 50%

opposite hip now notice that if you want
more<00:05:22.789> tapered<00:05:23.389> we<00:05:24.139> simply<00:05:24.590> push<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.159> phone

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
more tapered we simply push the phone

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.620 
more tapered we simply push the phone
closer<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.599> spring<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.590> let's<00:05:27.919> do<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.630> few

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
closer to the spring so let's do a few

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.439 
closer to the spring so let's do a few
things<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.320> make<00:05:30.349> this<00:05:30.740> operation<00:05:31.400> safe<00:05:31.669> what

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
things to make this operation safe what

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.450 
things to make this operation safe what
about<00:05:32.539> protection<00:05:33.440> of<00:05:33.560> your<00:05:33.680> eyes<00:05:33.800> let's<00:05:34.310> wear

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
about protection of your eyes let's wear

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.279 
about protection of your eyes let's wear
safety<00:05:34.729> glasses<00:05:34.940> so<00:05:35.690> we've<00:05:35.810> got<00:05:35.930> two<00:05:36.020> safety

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
safety glasses so we've got two safety

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.620 
safety glasses so we've got two safety
glasses<00:05:36.470> what<00:05:37.280> about<00:05:37.490> if<00:05:37.909> the<00:05:38.030> wire<00:05:38.240> were<00:05:38.509> to

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
glasses what about if the wire were to

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.629 
glasses what about if the wire were to
break<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.650> spring<00:05:39.860> it's<00:05:40.009> fine<00:05:40.190> we'll<00:05:40.460> pull

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
break the spring it's fine we'll pull

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.520 
break the spring it's fine we'll pull
the<00:05:40.789> broken<00:05:40.909> wire<00:05:41.360> toward<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.050> spring<00:05:42.320> but

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
the broken wire toward the spring but

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.230 
the broken wire toward the spring but
some<00:05:42.830> short<00:05:43.070> piece<00:05:43.250> of<00:05:43.280> wire<00:05:43.490> might

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
some short piece of wire might
