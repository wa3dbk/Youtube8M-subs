washed<00:02:45.359> it<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.959> still<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.319> looks<00:02:46.560> great

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
washed it and it still just looks great

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
washed it and it still just looks great
as<00:02:47.250> opposed<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> my<00:02:47.880> other<00:02:48.090> extensions<00:02:48.569> that

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
as opposed to my other extensions that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.539 
as opposed to my other extensions that
would<00:02:48.840> look<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.160> Raggedy<00:02:50.160> Ann<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.400> this
