00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
believe these two players know each

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.570 
believe these two players know each
other<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.830> have<00:00:22.830> fought<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.310> many

ironically Zerg over here on the west

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.440 
ironically Zerg over here on the west
corner<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> north<00:00:34.770> side<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> be

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
corner and the north side is going to be

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.130 
corner and the north side is going to be
our<00:00:36.630> Protoss<00:00:37.079> player<00:00:37.290> liquid<00:00:37.710> Hut<00:00:38.149> from<00:00:39.149> Tim

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
our Protoss player liquid Hut from Tim

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.889 
our Protoss player liquid Hut from Tim
liquid<00:00:40.500> who<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.340> believe<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
liquid who also I believe have the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
liquid who also I believe have the
little<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.469> them<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.770> their<00:00:44.040> team<00:00:44.280> who's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
little one on them on their team who's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940 
little one on them on their team who's
quite<00:00:45.239> well-known<00:00:45.719> amongst<00:00:46.320> many<00:00:46.500> circles

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
quite well-known amongst many circles

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
quite well-known amongst many circles
now<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.670> first<00:00:47.910> pylon<00:00:48.300> drop<00:00:48.600> with

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
now we do see that first pylon drop with

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.569 
now we do see that first pylon drop with
the<00:00:49.230> probe<00:00:49.469> scouting<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the probe scouting going the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
the probe scouting going the
counterclockwise<00:00:51.230> due<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> fact<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
counterclockwise due to the fact that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.439 
counterclockwise due to the fact that
this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> closest<00:00:53.399> baseman<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.059> Zerg<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this is the closest baseman the Zerg is

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
this is the closest baseman the Zerg is
just<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.500> who<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.160> looks<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
just going to a who this looks like it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.990 
just going to a who this looks like it
could<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> six<00:00:57.600> pool<00:00:58.100> yes<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.789> going

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
could be a six pool yes so this is going

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.130 
could be a six pool yes so this is going
to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> an<00:01:00.300> interesting<00:01:00.539> play<00:01:00.899> because

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to be an interesting play because

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
to be an interesting play because
Protoss<00:01:01.500> player<00:01:01.680> wolf<00:01:01.949> scout<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.520> very

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
Protoss player wolf scout this out very

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.870 
Protoss player wolf scout this out very
fast<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.780> Huck<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.500> gonna<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.040> let's<00:01:05.729> see

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
fast so Huck is gonna see this let's see

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340 
fast so Huck is gonna see this let's see
how<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.090> reacts<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> production

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
how he reacts is go to the production

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
how he reacts is go to the production
tell<00:01:07.619> Willie<00:01:07.799> dropped<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> forward<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.760> do

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
tell Willie dropped down a forward to do

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120 
tell Willie dropped down a forward to do
a<00:01:08.939> forward<00:01:09.270> fold<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.049> xueqing<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> saying<00:01:10.860> no

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
a forward fold so xueqing is saying no

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.190 
a forward fold so xueqing is saying no
because<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.119> six<00:01:12.299> ball<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.600> been<00:01:12.630> scattered

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
because the six ball has been scattered

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.460 
because the six ball has been scattered
by<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.610> Protoss<00:01:14.610> which<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.240> set<00:01:15.840> him<00:01:16.049> behind

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
by the Protoss which can set him behind

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
by the Protoss which can set him behind
when<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.909> what's<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> put

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
when we see that what's going to be put

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
when we see that what's going to be put
down<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.900> support<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.530> once<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> forge<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
down your support so once the forge is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
down your support so once the forge is
gone<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.049> Photon

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
gone down we are going to see Photon

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
gone down we are going to see Photon
Cannons<00:01:22.770> put<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.240> photons<00:01:24.570> will

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
Cannons put up here and the photons will

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
Cannons put up here and the photons will
stop<00:01:25.080> any<00:01:25.290> earlier<00:01:25.830> serving<00:01:26.610> run<00:01:26.759> buys<00:01:26.939> when

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
stop any earlier serving run buys when

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
stop any earlier serving run buys when
you<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.689> other<00:01:27.990> Pro<00:01:28.259> coming<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.710> II

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you see that on other Pro coming out II

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.069 
you see that on other Pro coming out II
just<00:01:29.240> standing<00:01:30.240> around<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:31.049> can

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
just standing around so that there can

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.840 
just standing around so that there can
be<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.890> gateway<00:01:32.729> drop<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.020> we'll<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
be a a gateway drop down so we'll get a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.069 
be a a gateway drop down so we'll get a
photon<00:01:35.850> cannon<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> Gateway<00:01:36.900> and

photon cannon with the Gateway and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.420 
photon cannon with the Gateway and
gateway<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.799> some<00:01:37.979> units<00:01:38.250> no

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
overlord he is just outside of the range

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.030 
overlord he is just outside of the range
that<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> very<00:03:23.840> sneaky<00:03:24.840> close<00:03:25.110> play<00:03:25.770> there

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
that is a very sneaky close play there

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.520 
that is a very sneaky close play there
and<00:03:26.270> that's<00:03:27.270> all<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.540> still<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:28.050> not<00:03:28.260> catch

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and that's all it still can not catch

and that's all it still can not catch
these<00:03:28.830> links<00:03:29.250> now<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.470> there<00:03:31.470> are

for the Zerg player pumping more lava

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.240 
for the Zerg player pumping more lava
out<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.170> those<00:03:43.350> lava<00:03:43.530> what<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:43.920> he<00:03:43.980> going<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.160> do

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
out so those lava what is he going to do

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.410 
out so those lava what is he going to do
is<00:03:44.370> you're<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.640> drone<00:03:44.910> up<00:03:45.090> or<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.330> it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
is you're going to drone up or is it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.729 
is you're going to drone up or is it
going<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.570> link<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.110> try<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.260> do<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> front

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
going to link up and try to do a front

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.710 
going to link up and try to do a front
door<00:03:46.860> bus<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.310> seems<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.180> far<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.570> he's<00:03:48.690> just

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
door bus it seems so far that he's just

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.990 
door bus it seems so far that he's just
going<00:03:49.020> for<00:03:49.290> more<00:03:49.530> drones<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.130> more<00:03:50.580> overlords

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
going for more drones and more overlords

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.030 
going for more drones and more overlords
and<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.330> got<00:03:51.450> double<00:03:51.750> queen<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.680> has<00:03:52.860> come

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and it's got double queen this has come

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.390 
and it's got double queen this has come
before<00:03:53.250> he's<00:03:54.090> actually<00:03:54.300> got<00:03:54.540> his<00:03:54.630> expansion

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
before he's actually got his expansion

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.620 
before he's actually got his expansion
the<00:03:56.400> reason<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.180> once<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
the reason for that is so that once the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.229 
the reason for that is so that once the
expansions<00:03:58.140> built<00:03:58.350> you'll<00:03:58.860> be<00:03:59.010> able<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.549> use

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
expansions built you'll be able to use

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.840 
expansions built you'll be able to use
that<00:04:00.739> saved<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:01.950> energy<00:04:02.130> from<00:04:02.549> one<00:04:02.640> of<00:04:02.760> his

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
that saved up energy from one of his

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.970 
that saved up energy from one of his
Queens<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.660> actually<00:04:04.049> uh

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
Queens to actually uh

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.390 
Queens to actually uh
keep<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:06.050> lava<00:04:07.050> count<00:04:07.409> going<00:04:07.739> up<00:04:07.860> while<00:04:08.190> he's

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
keep the lava count going up while he's

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.740 
keep the lava count going up while he's
doing<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.909> Queen<00:04:09.150> will<00:04:09.330> block<00:04:09.569> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
doing that this Queen will block the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.869 
doing that this Queen will block the
ramp<00:04:09.959> from<00:04:10.170> any<00:04:10.440> probes<00:04:10.769> getting<00:04:11.099> in<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.700> this

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
ramp from any probes getting in so this

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.880 
ramp from any probes getting in so this
is<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> great<00:04:12.239> play<00:04:12.510> by<00:04:12.690> circling<00:04:13.080> yes<00:04:13.349> so<00:04:13.769> he's

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
is a great play by circling yes so he's

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.350 
is a great play by circling yes so he's
attacking<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.519> that<00:04:14.610> second<00:04:14.970> one<00:04:15.030> will<00:04:15.209> take

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
attacking and that second one will take

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.000 
attacking and that second one will take
it<00:04:15.510> down<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:15.989> go<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:16.350> two<00:04:16.410> queens<00:04:16.769> take

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
it down there we go so two queens take

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
it down there we go so two queens take
down<00:04:17.160> one<00:04:17.310> probe<00:04:17.579> pretty<00:04:18.090> quickly<00:04:18.419> and

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
down one probe pretty quickly and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.360 
down one probe pretty quickly and
efficiently<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.560> do<00:04:19.709> see<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:20.010> there's<00:04:20.220> one

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
efficiently we do see that there's one

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.159 
efficiently we do see that there's one
overlord<00:04:20.820> two<00:04:21.000> overlords<00:04:21.479> in<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:21.810> while

this<00:05:12.780> hatchery<00:05:12.990> will<00:05:13.349> get<00:05:13.530> built<00:05:13.740> but<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.979> will

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
this hatchery will get built but it will

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.460 
this hatchery will get built but it will
have<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.639> lot<00:05:15.000> less<00:05:15.210> health<00:05:15.419> though<00:05:15.900> with<00:05:16.200> two

transfuse<00:05:20.070> later<00:05:20.280> on<00:05:20.550> so<00:05:20.700> that's<00:05:20.880> not<00:05:21.060> really

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
transfuse later on so that's not really

in the vacuum we do see that this creep

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.690 
in the vacuum we do see that this creep
on<00:05:25.110> low<00:05:25.289> ground<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:25.770> do<00:05:25.889> see<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.220> this<00:05:26.370> spike

on low ground we do see that this spike

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.100 
on low ground we do see that this spike
collar<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.090> coming<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.479> it's<00:05:27.780> going<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:27.960> depend

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
this hatchery right here that's a very

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.580 
this hatchery right here that's a very
good<00:05:29.970> placement<00:05:30.510> or<00:05:30.599> it's<00:05:30.720> adding<00:05:31.050> extra<00:05:31.380> wall

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
good placement or it's adding extra wall

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.740 
good placement or it's adding extra wall
inch<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.919> go<00:05:32.039> around<00:05:32.430> even<00:05:32.940> further<00:05:33.180> taking

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
inch to go around even further taking

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.260 
inch to go around even further taking
longer<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.169> get<00:05:34.349> to<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.620> ramp<00:05:34.830> if<00:05:35.820> we<00:05:35.970> do<00:05:36.090> look

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
longer to get to the ramp if we do look

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.909 
longer to get to the ramp if we do look
from<00:05:36.630> one<00:05:36.900> angle<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.349> another<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:37.770> can

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
from one angle to another you can

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.040 
from one angle to another you can
actually<00:05:38.099> see<00:05:38.340> how<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.729> line<00:05:39.300> line<00:05:39.780> work<00:05:40.020> is

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
actually see how the line line work is

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.350 
actually see how the line line work is
going<00:05:40.470> on<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:41.160> this<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.520> gap<00:05:41.700> differential

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
going on so this is the gap differential

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.690 
going on so this is the gap differential
wings<00:05:42.570> can<00:05:42.780> go<00:05:42.900> by<00:05:43.110> their<00:05:43.400> stalkers<00:05:44.400> could

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
wings can go by their stalkers could

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.339 
wings can go by their stalkers could
come<00:05:44.880> by<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.090> zealots<00:05:45.599> but<00:05:45.780> if<00:05:45.900> they<00:05:46.020> do<00:05:46.080> come

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
come by and zealots but if they do come

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.080 
come by and zealots but if they do come
by<00:05:46.500> they'll<00:05:46.680> get<00:05:46.800> met<00:05:47.070> by<00:05:47.250> reinforcements<00:05:48.030> oh

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
by they'll get met by reinforcements oh

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.700 
by they'll get met by reinforcements oh
that's<00:05:48.240> great<00:05:48.450> it's<00:05:48.960> not<00:05:49.110> going<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.320> force<00:05:49.470> his

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
that's great it's not going to force his

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.070 
that's great it's not going to force his
own<00:05:49.950> units<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.520> come<00:05:50.669> a<00:05:50.700> ride<00:05:50.970> around<00:05:51.090> he's

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
own units to come a ride around he's

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.480 
own units to come a ride around he's
going<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.289> be<00:05:52.410> able<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.680> use<00:05:52.919> his<00:05:53.010> own<00:05:53.190> units

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
going to be able to use his own units

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.700 
going to be able to use his own units
come<00:05:53.700> through<00:05:53.880> so<00:05:54.030> now<00:05:54.180> he's<00:05:54.300> using<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.710> tank

turtling technique which a lot of Terran
do<00:05:58.080> but<00:05:58.289> so<00:05:58.470> can<00:05:58.650> do<00:05:58.800> it<00:05:58.889> with<00:05:59.039> their<00:05:59.190> spine

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
do but so can do it with their spine

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.250 
do but so can do it with their spine

crawlers of moving the map is going from
two<00:06:01.860> more<00:06:02.039> spine<00:06:02.280> call<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:02.910> this<00:06:03.120> is<00:06:03.150> gonna

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580 
just to freak out the player he probably

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.119 
just to freak out the player he probably
won't<00:07:47.090> shoot<00:07:47.390> me<00:07:47.450> on<00:07:47.720> why<00:07:48.020> did<00:07:48.380> she

then again stop yourself so there's one

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.619 
then again stop yourself so there's one
Hydra<00:07:51.979> coming<00:07:52.279> out<00:07:52.429> because<00:07:53.270> of<00:07:53.389> the<00:07:53.449> fact

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:53.629

that this is taking so much damage he

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:56.260 
that this is taking so much damage he
probably<00:07:55.309> knows<00:07:55.669> that<00:07:55.969> it's<00:07:56.119> actually

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.270
