00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.120 
all right what's up Internet in today's
video<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.720> want<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.049> tell<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.350> guys<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.830> one

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
video I want to tell you guys about one

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.020 
video I want to tell you guys about one
of<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.339> very<00:00:05.549> few<00:00:06.200> shortcuts<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.470> Tekken<00:00:08.160> Tag

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
of the very few shortcuts in Tekken Tag

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.240 
of the very few shortcuts in Tekken Tag
Tournament<00:00:09.090> 2<00:00:09.590> and<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.800> button

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
Tournament 2 and that is button

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.370 
Tournament 2 and that is button
buffering<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.690> game<00:00:12.870> doesn't<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.200> very

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
buffering so this game doesn't have very

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.049 
buffering so this game doesn't have very
many<00:00:13.590> shortcuts<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.250> terms<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.639> left-hand

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
many shortcuts in terms of left-hand

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.750 
many shortcuts in terms of left-hand
execution<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:16.020> there<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> shortcut<00:00:17.460> in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
execution but there is a shortcut in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
execution but there is a shortcut in
place<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.390> your<00:00:18.480> right<00:00:18.750> hand<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.740> will

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
place for your right hand that will

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.519 
place for your right hand that will
assist<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.720> doing<00:00:21.720> commands<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
assist you in doing commands that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.370 
assist you in doing commands that
involve<00:00:22.890> multiple<00:00:23.430> button<00:00:23.789> presses<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:25.230> way

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
involve multiple button presses the way

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189 
involve multiple button presses the way
it<00:00:25.529> works<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> game<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.930> push

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
it works is so in this game if you push

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
it works is so in this game if you push
a<00:00:28.230> button<00:00:28.380> down<00:00:28.800> let's<00:00:29.160> say<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.640> case<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
a button down let's say in this case the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
a button down let's say in this case the
one<00:00:30.269> button<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> hold<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:31.980> as

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
one button and you hold it down as

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.970 
one button and you hold it down as
you're<00:00:32.969> moving<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.660> you're<00:00:33.870> doing<00:00:34.590> anything

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
you're moving and you're doing anything

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
you're moving and you're doing anything
else<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.550> holding<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.239> button<00:00:36.450> down

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
else if you're holding that button down

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.229 
else if you're holding that button down
it<00:00:36.960> still<00:00:37.350> counts<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.280> button<00:00:38.520> actively

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it still counts as a one button actively

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.650 
it still counts as a one button actively
so<00:00:39.809> let's<00:00:40.620> say<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:41.520> moving<00:00:42.000> around<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
so let's say I'm moving around and I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
so let's say I'm moving around and I
want<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> punish<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.530> forward<00:00:43.980> 1<00:00:44.160> plus<00:00:44.430> 2

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
want to punish with forward 1 plus 2

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.660 
want to punish with forward 1 plus 2
which<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.629> move<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
which is this move right here all I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.020 
which is this move right here all I
would<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.930> hold<00:00:49.469> down<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.550> 1<00:00:50.789> or

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
would have to do is hold down the 1 or

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.779 
would have to do is hold down the 1 or
the<00:00:51.239> 2<00:00:51.270> button<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.930> move<00:00:52.469> around<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.579> at

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the 2 button and move around and then at

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
the 2 button and move around and then at
the<00:00:54.090> point<00:00:54.120> where<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> feel<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> opponent

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the point where I feel like the opponent

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
the point where I feel like the opponent
made<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> mistake<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.550> whisk<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
made a mistake and they whisk all I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
made a mistake and they whisk all I
would<00:00:57.899> need<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> hit<00:00:58.829> forward<00:00:59.250> plus<00:00:59.579> 2

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
would need to do is hit forward plus 2

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.760 
would need to do is hit forward plus 2
and<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and as you can see right there on the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.910 
and as you can see right there on the
command<00:01:02.100> history<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:03.260> registers<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.470> forward

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
command history it registers as forward

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.719 
command history it registers as forward
1<00:01:05.189> plus<00:01:05.460> 2<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.560> there<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.920> many<00:01:08.340> many

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
1 plus 2 now there are many many

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.260 
1 plus 2 now there are many many
countless<00:01:09.540> ways<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.049> use<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
countless ways to use this to kind of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
for 3 into back 1 plus 2 at the wall

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.070 
for 3 into back 1 plus 2 at the wall
what<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.280> soon<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.939> hit<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.540> 3

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
what I do is as soon as I hit up for 3

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
what I do is as soon as I hit up for 3
I<00:01:25.110> hold<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.189> button<00:01:26.549> down<00:01:26.700> every<00:01:27.180> time

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
I hold the two button down every time

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.410 
I hold the two button down every time
every<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.380> move<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:30.119> 3<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
every time I do this move so a for 3 I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
every time I do this move so a for 3 I
hold<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> 2<00:01:31.200> button<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.009> connected<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
hold the 2 button and if it connected I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.990 
hold the 2 button and if it connected I
just<00:01:33.509> hit<00:01:33.659> back<00:01:33.869> plus<00:01:34.200> 1<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.400> I'll<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just hit back plus 1 that way I'll get a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
just hit back plus 1 that way I'll get a
back<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:37.020> plus<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> bind<00:01:38.159> every

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
back one plus two for the bind every

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
back one plus two for the bind every
time<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.630> mean<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.049> will<00:01:40.290> never<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
time I mean you will never have a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
time I mean you will never have a
mistake<00:01:41.820> again<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> comes<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.049> hitting

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
mistake again when it comes to hitting

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
mistake again when it comes to hitting
two<00:01:43.470> buttons<00:01:43.770> at<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.920> same<00:01:44.009> time<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:45.329> have

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
two buttons at the same time I have

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
two buttons at the same time I have
another<00:01:46.259> example<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.579> very

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
another example here that's very

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.380 
another example here that's very
interesting<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> case<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> King's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
interesting so in the case of King's

command<00:01:54.630> list<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.460> here

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
command list this one right here

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.260 
command list this one right here
chicken<00:01:57.869> wing<00:01:58.020> face<00:01:58.350> lock<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.369> first<00:01:59.640> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
chicken wing face lock so the first the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
chicken wing face lock so the first the
first<00:02:00.540> part<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.899> command<00:02:01.229> throw<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.530> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
first part of this command throw is this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
first part of this command throw is this
one<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.280> Crouch<00:02:02.700> dash<00:02:02.969> into<00:02:03.270> 1<00:02:04.049> plus<00:02:04.320> 4

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
one which is Crouch dash into 1 plus 4

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
one which is Crouch dash into 1 plus 4
and<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.399> next<00:02:05.520> command<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.270> this

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and then the next command is this

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.839 
and then the next command is this
command<00:02:07.229> right<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.940> 2<00:02:09.379> 1<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.129> 1

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
command right here it's 2 1 and then 1

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.280 
command right here it's 2 1 and then 1
plus<00:02:12.150> 2<00:02:12.390> plus<00:02:12.690> 3

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
plus 2 plus 3

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.770 
plus 2 plus 3
so<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:14.400> seems<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.909> difficult<00:02:15.180> command

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so that seems like a difficult command

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.289 
so that seems like a difficult command
to<00:02:15.989> execute<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:16.830> your<00:02:17.010> right<00:02:17.280> hand<00:02:17.519> however

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
to execute with your right hand however

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.440 
to execute with your right hand however
all<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.659> need<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.439> is<00:02:19.709> hit<00:02:20.280> during<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.909> arm

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
all you need to do is hit during the arm

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.140 
all you need to do is hit during the arm
break<00:02:21.750> all<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.319> need<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.799> hit<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.150> then

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
break all you need to do is hit to then

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.110 
break all you need to do is hit to then
hold<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.689> two<00:02:24.840> down<00:02:25.079> one<00:02:25.459> hold<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:26.849> down

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
hold the two down one hold the one down

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.899 
hold the two down one hold the one down
and<00:02:27.420> then<00:02:27.900> hit<00:02:28.140> three<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.129> registers<00:02:29.700> is

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
and then hit three so that registers is

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.050 
and then hit three so that registers is
all<00:02:30.150> three<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:31.019> becomes<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.680> very<00:02:32.060> smooth

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
all three and that becomes a very smooth

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.289 
all three and that becomes a very smooth
easy<00:02:33.450> transition<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:35.280> two<00:02:35.459> three<00:02:35.730> very

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
easy transition one two three very

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.059 
easy transition one two three very
simple<00:02:36.599> it's<00:02:37.260> very<00:02:37.379> easy<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.159> do<00:02:38.310> um<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:40.530> type

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
simple it's very easy to do um this type

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.339 
simple it's very easy to do um this type
of<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.340> trick<00:02:41.609> this<00:02:41.790> button<00:02:42.120> buffer<00:02:42.420> trick<00:02:42.659> it's

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
of a trick this button buffer trick it's

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.619 
of a trick this button buffer trick it's
very<00:02:43.709> basic<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.670> understand<00:02:45.150> most<00:02:45.359> of<00:02:45.569> the

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
very basic and I understand most of the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.270 
very basic and I understand most of the
Tekken<00:02:45.930> players<00:02:46.170> out<00:02:46.709> there<00:02:47.040> who<00:02:47.159> are

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
Tekken players out there who are

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.009 
Tekken players out there who are
watching<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.790> are<00:02:47.970> probably<00:02:48.000> thinking<00:02:48.569> you

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
watching this are probably thinking you

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.110 
watching this are probably thinking you
know<00:02:49.109> who<00:02:49.290> gives<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.680> shit<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.909> lot

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
know who gives a shit but I think a lot

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.629 
know who gives a shit but I think a lot
of<00:02:51.150> people<00:02:51.599> over<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> years<00:02:52.650> perhaps<00:02:53.370> have

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
of people over the years perhaps have

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.960 
of people over the years perhaps have
you<00:02:53.819> either<00:02:54.150> overlooked<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.959> or<00:02:55.079> maybe<00:02:55.970> they

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
you either overlooked it or maybe they

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.360 
you either overlooked it or maybe they
neglect<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.569> pay<00:02:57.989> close<00:02:58.590> attention<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:59.159> it

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
neglect to pay close attention to it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.759 
neglect to pay close attention to it
because<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.909> mean<00:03:00.659> when<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> tournaments

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
because I mean when I go to tournaments

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.309 
because I mean when I go to tournaments
myself<00:03:02.220> when<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.489> watch<00:03:02.760> matches<00:03:03.359> I<00:03:03.569> can<00:03:04.109> see

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
myself when I watch matches I can see

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.910 
myself when I watch matches I can see
that<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> lot<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.889> people<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:06.620> input<00:03:07.620> errors

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
that a lot of people have input errors

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.410 
that a lot of people have input errors
when<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.159> comes<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.489> double<00:03:08.790> button<00:03:09.030> presses

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
when it comes to double button presses

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.649 
when it comes to double button presses
it<00:03:09.569> happens<00:03:09.930> relatively<00:03:10.889> often<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.150> um

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
it happens relatively often so um

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.410 
it happens relatively often so um
