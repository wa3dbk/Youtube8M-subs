up in your upper digestive tracts which

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.689 
up in your upper digestive tracts which
is<00:00:37.929> not<00:00:38.199> very<00:00:38.229> you<00:00:38.710> going<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:39.010> absorb<00:00:39.129> most<00:00:39.489> of

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
is not very you going to absorb most of

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.669 
is not very you going to absorb most of
my<00:00:39.879> nutrition<00:00:40.449> it's<00:00:40.600> more<00:00:40.839> in<00:00:40.989> than<00:00:41.109> in<00:00:41.530> your

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
my nutrition it's more in than in your

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.160 
my nutrition it's more in than in your
lower<00:00:41.889> tracks<00:00:42.309> so<00:00:42.789> therefore<00:00:43.089> that<00:00:43.929> many

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
lower tracks so therefore that many

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.469 
lower tracks so therefore that many
times<00:00:44.379> you<00:00:44.530> use<00:00:44.769> up<00:00:45.039> and<00:00:45.519> or<00:00:45.850> burn<00:00:46.089> up<00:00:46.209> like<00:00:46.359> in

times you use up and or burn up like in

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.629 
times you use up and or burn up like in

active ingredients within it that once

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.649 
active ingredients within it that once
the<00:01:05.680> outside<00:01:06.009> comes<00:01:06.219> to<00:01:06.369> dissolve<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.390> local

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
the outside comes to dissolve the local

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.450 
the outside comes to dissolve the local
cops<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:08.020> will<00:01:08.109> continue<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.710> travel<00:01:09.070> and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
cops you will continue to travel and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.969 
cops you will continue to travel and
then<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.939> really<00:01:10.180> releases<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.990> nutrition<00:01:11.560> at

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
then it really releases the nutrition at

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.800 
then it really releases the nutrition at
the<00:01:12.159> right<00:01:12.369> place<00:01:12.640> at<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.880> right<00:01:12.969> time<00:01:13.149> so<00:01:13.719> you

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
the right place at the right time so you

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.649 
the right place at the right time so you
get<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.170> most<00:01:14.439> effective<00:01:15.450> benefits<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.630> the

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
most results from each one of these that

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.569 
most results from each one of these that
is<00:01:19.990> three<00:01:20.200> times<00:01:20.500> one<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.219> them<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.399> for

is three times one of them is for

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.160 
is three times one of them is for
firming<00:01:22.000> that's<00:01:22.420> what<00:01:22.659> they're<00:01:22.869> typically

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
and then the third one would be that's

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.200 
and then the third one would be that's
cool<00:01:29.619> calm<00:01:29.890> skin<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.310> for<00:01:30.520> people<00:01:30.820> have<00:01:30.999> a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
cool calm skin is for people have a

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.870 
cool calm skin is for people have a
sensitive<00:01:31.689> skin<00:01:31.960> or<00:01:32.079> rosacea

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
sensitive skin or rosacea

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.639 
sensitive skin or rosacea
specifically<00:01:34.780> designed<00:01:35.079> for<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.350> state

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
specifically designed for the state

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.399 
specifically designed for the state
these<00:01:35.920> conditions<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.689> very<00:01:37.930> well

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
these conditions so this is a very well

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.310 
these conditions so this is a very well
researched<00:01:38.890> on<00:01:39.250> your<00:01:39.430> end<00:01:39.960> vitamin<00:01:40.960> to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
researched on your end vitamin to

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.590
