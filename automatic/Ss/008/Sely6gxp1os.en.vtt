opinion is about matches like these and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
opinion is about matches like these and
I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.579> an<00:00:47.789> interesting<00:00:48.000> battle

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I think this is an interesting battle

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.779 
I think this is an interesting battle
just<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:49.980> Gaara<00:00:50.370> relies<00:00:50.760> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
just because you know Gaara relies on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
just because you know Gaara relies on
his<00:00:51.059> sand<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.660> order<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> protect<00:00:52.140> him<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
his sand in order to protect him and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.369 
his sand in order to protect him and
also<00:00:53.160> he<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.239> attack<00:00:54.750> people<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
also he can use it to attack people and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.520 
also he can use it to attack people and
you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.980> basically<00:00:56.430> fight<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.449> him<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you know basically fight for him so and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
you know basically fight for him so and
so<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.460> she<00:00:59.730> no<00:00:59.910> does<00:01:00.180> also<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> same<00:01:00.840> thing

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so what she no does also the same thing

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.640 
so what she no does also the same thing
using<00:01:01.289> his<00:01:01.530> bugs<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.160> place<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> um<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> know

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
using his bugs in place and um you know
it<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.100> would<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.460> think<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.909> very

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it I would just think this is a very

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
it I would just think this is a very
interesting<00:01:06.180> battle<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.900> wits<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.530> be

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
than saying in my opinion I feel like

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
than saying in my opinion I feel like
Gaara<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:12.090> win<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:13.170> he's<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Gaara would win not just because he's a

admit<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.500> mean<00:01:46.680> granted<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:47.490> both<00:01:47.670> have

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
admit and I mean granted they both have

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
admit and I mean granted they both have
the<00:01:47.939> same<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.720> white<00:01:49.229> style<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.310> mean

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the same like white style then I mean

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
the same like white style then I mean
you<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> consider<00:01:51.780> who<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.350> come<00:01:52.590> out

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you have to consider who would come out

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
you have to consider who would come out
on<00:01:52.890> top<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.790> feel<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.180> Gaara

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
on top with because I feel like Gaara

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
on top with because I feel like Gaara
would<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.619> bit<00:01:55.829> slower<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:57.030> too

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
would be a little bit slower not too

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
would be a little bit slower not too
much<00:01:57.390> slower<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.079> bit<00:01:58.170> slower<00:01:58.439> then

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
much slower but a little bit slower then

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
much slower but a little bit slower then
of<00:02:00.619> Chino<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.659> San<00:02:03.659> doesn't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
of Chino because you know San doesn't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
of Chino because you know San doesn't
move<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.290> fast<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.850> Gaara<00:02:06.509> has

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
move that fast and I know that Gaara has

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.419 
move that fast and I know that Gaara has
probably<00:02:07.079> trained<00:02:07.439> enough<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.770> make<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> sand

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
probably trained enough to make the sand

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300 
probably trained enough to make the sand
move<00:02:08.610> faster<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.770> fast<00:02:11.099> enough

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
move faster but would it be fast enough

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.300 
move faster but would it be fast enough
to<00:02:11.489> avoid<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.690> bud

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
to avoid the bud

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.820 
to avoid the bud

no has casino is various morning what he

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.580 
no has casino is various morning what he
does<00:02:16.040> he<00:02:16.640> knows<00:02:17.150> how<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.420> use<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.810> bugs<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.410> his

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
does he knows how to use the bugs to his

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.220 
does he knows how to use the bugs to his
advantage<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.280> he<00:02:19.400> can<00:02:19.550> basically<00:02:19.849> use<00:02:20.420> his

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
advantage and he can basically use his

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.990 
advantage and he can basically use his
surroundings<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.250> said<00:02:22.459> these<00:02:22.640> two<00:02:22.819> have

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
surroundings like I said these two have

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.150 
surroundings like I said these two have
Mike<00:02:23.450> most<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.959> same<00:02:24.170> fight<00:02:24.530> style<00:02:24.890> and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
Mike most of the same fight style and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.309 
Mike most of the same fight style and
they<00:02:25.670> both<00:02:25.940> rely<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.300> their<00:02:26.510> environment<00:02:27.080> more

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
they both rely on their environment more

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.080 
they both rely on their environment more
than<00:02:27.560> anything<00:02:27.739> like<00:02:28.190> gah<00:02:28.489> relies<00:02:28.819> on<00:02:28.849> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
than anything like gah relies on the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.089 
than anything like gah relies on the
ground<00:02:29.330> that's<00:02:29.630> around<00:02:29.870> him<00:02:30.080> he<00:02:30.500> lose<00:02:30.920> her

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
ground that's around him he lose her

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.400 
ground that's around him he lose her
split<00:02:31.400> places<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:32.000> he<00:02:32.390> can<00:02:32.569> turn<00:02:32.780> into<00:02:32.989> sand

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
split places that he can turn into sand

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.580 
split places that he can turn into sand
to<00:02:34.160> be<00:02:34.340> more<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.880> his<00:02:34.910> benefit<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.410> have

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
to be more to his benefit and you have

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.370 
to be more to his benefit and you have
like<00:02:36.620> she<00:02:37.550> know<00:02:37.730> who<00:02:38.060> also<00:02:38.269> uses<00:02:38.540> his<00:02:38.810> bugs<00:02:39.080> so

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
like she know who also uses his bugs so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.140 
like she know who also uses his bugs so
they<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.709> use<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.250> environment<00:02:40.970> for

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
they can use this environment for

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.470 
they can use this environment for
themselves<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:42.200> multiply<00:02:42.769> even<00:02:43.130> more<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:43.849> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
themselves to multiply even more or you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.539 
themselves to multiply even more or you
know<00:02:44.660> he<00:02:44.989> can<00:02:45.110> find<00:02:45.319> more<00:02:45.500> bugs<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.920> use<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.400> he

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
know he can find more bugs to use to he

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.000 
know he can find more bugs to use to he
can<00:02:46.730> also<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.989> fight<00:02:48.380> with<00:02:48.620> him<00:02:48.830> and
