00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.969
 but 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 1 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.850
 and hello to you all these 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.190
 levels and welcome to this droid game 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.660
 devoted to night fall a game all 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.590
 recent who is talking a lot about him 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.540
 change a little bit our habits 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.460
 classic multiplayer fps 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.260
 so I do not have much to you 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.910
 tell about the game the bag by not being 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.620
 not enormously developed since 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.630
 This is a multiplayer game 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.490
 without a real solo campaign but in this 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.290
 universe arises so two factions the imc 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.699
 the private army in charge of annexing 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.040
 to exploit new lands 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.080
 planet and the rebel single militia 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.220
 trying to prevent the imc of 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.310
 spread on all sides of the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.690
 galaxy is so the gameplay is entered 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.130
 nervous we do not necessarily take the time 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.960
 to observe what is going on behind 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.550
 but the cards are rather varied and if 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.050
 we just stop running on 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.820
 walls and jump all sides of 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.740
 second we can see backgrounds 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.270
 and really nice moods setting 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.740
 on stage is particularly cool between 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.729
 the ships strolling over 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.530
 our heads the skies rather 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.780
 impressive and very pretty horizon 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.250
 mountainous and space then science 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.960
 fiction of this kind rhymes with 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.700
 metal textures of buildings very 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.889
 Geometric crane or other vehicles 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.780
 industrialists to heavy military and 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.610
 add soldiers to the explosions of 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.430
 mash shots and halos of light 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.380
 and bam it's the high tone and saf 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.120
 crazy what I wanted to represent in 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.530
 the drawing and which has left me the most 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.760
 the game like many others I think 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.010
 it's just the arrival of your 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.599
 titan we immediately this reflex of 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.820
 look to the sky and see our 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.410
 meka land right in front of us and that's it 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.940
 sends from where the low-angle of the 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.099
 scene and the titan arriving from heaven 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.810
 in front of some soldiers 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.490
 short if you're a fan of nervous fps and 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.880
 that you appreciate this style of science 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.680
 fiction 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.060
 I want a little look and 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.650
 enjoy your titan for you 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.729
 let off steam with a little bug and feel free to 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.349
 tell me in the comments as 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.970
 usually for example situations where 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.740
 places that have marked you more than 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.030
 the others in the game and on those 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.360
 wear well I tell you to very 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.810
 soon 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.810
 ciao
