00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.400
 so you dear I have something there 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.779
 so we do not prepare like that 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.010
 long to make the video namely namely 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.719
 always if I'm just a macher 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.300
 usually only on the weekend but for 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.580
 you also today under the week 50 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.680
 gram card ham and 50 grams kern 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.869
 ham the flag is already 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.590
 preheated I know that now easy 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.720
 times everything in here completely without fat 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.720
 I currently have no fat in it 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.239
 and we'll leave that whole now 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 Just go to stage 9 on the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.140
 sautÃ© the stove plate 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.190
 so that the taste of the ham 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.190
 can unfold nicely 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.010
 I mostly take 388 for that 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.360
 turns of salt and two turns 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.180
 because I always like a bit 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.370
 heartier and the whole thing with one 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.840
 shot milk through the world or too 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.350
 For example, mineral water take a lot 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.250
 many, I like the whole thing 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.450
 a bit quieter is the last end 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.450
 health milk to those, too 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.189
 as you once saw after a short time 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.939
 remains although 59 have no fat says 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.579
 bring nothing 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.079
 it all works out so you can be here 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.789
 I also go in with a metal frame 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.899
 but you recommend silicone and I do 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.899
 made of silicone 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.350
 that was again but also I can 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.710
 but cooking in the car like everyone else 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.710
 others too 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.860
 so now the whole a bit 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.509
 frying shortly makes that pleasure and 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.650
 I do not like them that long normally 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.570
 that a bit darker 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:13.330
 now we see that and why that is 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.830
 the movie but it's nice is 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.560
 You can see that the flag is very good 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.030
 extremely hot that means the whole thing begins 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.950
 So it is really extremely direct here 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.530
 At the trajectory it represents directly 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.530
 because we want to finish it 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.290
 the phone rings but that bothers us 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.010
 times not so good scrambled eggs today 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.510
 Of course, it turns nicely . I like that 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.400
 wiso if that is so in an area help 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 were a bit split you can 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.480
 should see beautiful here now 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.290
 there is nothing left there is nothing 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.840
 adhere 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.580
 many have as well as I clearly 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.030
 keep in mind that by the nubs below 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:04.530
 the extreme thing is how it hangs 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 actually again and again 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.989
 also usually theoretically the one 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 then rather if all this in it 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.799
 is in the stellmann the stove plate and on 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.440
 6 since I'm a bit 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.610
 I wanted to simulate extreme now 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.840
 of course , let the whole run on 9 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.780
 has just then the advantage of a scrambled egg 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.599
 finished even faster and I 'll be back 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.030
 faster in the enjoyment of this delicious 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.030
 bread with scrambled eggs ham and bacon 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.760
 but who is, of course, can do that 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.560
 whole is of course still a two 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.700
 Let simmer for a few minutes 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.560
 but then put it in the middle 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.269
 I just want to see you now 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.910
 show how much 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.800
 after this short time it is ready 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.960
 and so the flag now looks from the inside 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.900
 there is hardly anything left 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.930
 stick and at the same time still like you 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:38.710
 the super fast and super easy 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.710
 clean without problems thank you
