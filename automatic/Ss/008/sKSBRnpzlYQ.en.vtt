00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.360
 hello to all in this video we 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.660
 sends together the unpacking of the fnac 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:18.240
 and a little presentation of taking in 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.650
 hand so you see I'm not going to spend 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.400
 hours will be box you know 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.609
 all the box 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:31.239
 so I 'm leaving is seeing then we have 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:42.190
 new iphone 5 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.920
 then in the club car you see 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.000
 headphones in a box 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.970
 so that's pretty well I think 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.050
 for headphones so after you see 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:04.059
 this sector and the cases the rest so we have 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:08.409
 a small increase with 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.080
 apple stickers and for them to open to 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:21.970
 box so now in India then 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.229

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.280
 hallucinating so it's really ligier 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:33.890
 but that's fine it's really taking 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.960
 the screen conveyed in this collection one can 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:49.270

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:51.740

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.679
 the facebook app or not they 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.409

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:02.780

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:07.039
