00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.920
 hello very good we are here to record 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 a new video of 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.650
 of the new helmets good the new ones 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.650
 taking them to 2.0 are 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.850
 I have a friend asked me 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 several people but especially I have a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.330
 friend of the ps4 forum that has made me 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.960
 a series of questions because it's 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.820
 interested to find him so I go 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.489
 to try in this video to explain what 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 little that I understand since I am not 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.020
 specialist this far but 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.360
 good in everything that can help 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.140
 any of the forum people pec4 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.480
 offers four forums 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 you are interested in anything 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.170
 I put it under him and he tries 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.120
 answer then nothing because here is the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.879
 application that by the way you can 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.879
 go down even if you do not have the helmets 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.269
 see how it goes these are the two the two 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.600
 options that I have as I have this 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.009
 It is the one that I will select as 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.350
 You see, I have it in the shot 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.159
 just all helmets because almost of 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.100
 Either way I hear well 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.869
 I have put in shots one of the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.039
 questions that most the friend think is 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.960
 of if once it is personalized it is 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.030
 puts any option 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 if you can put back in the option 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.979
 number 2 of the helmets I sincerely 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.800
 I do not know because I do not know what it will be 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.040
 and I already have it changed but giving 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.409
 customize 1 2 or 3 next three 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.409
 options I think it can be done 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.150
 but if you have the edit button 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.690
 profile which is that of the triangle and now 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.910
 here you give 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.940
 to edit it as you want the serious 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.190
 configuration means do not 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.710
 I understand a lot but good is given 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.040
 then save or cancel and there what 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.200
 you have I leave a shot that the most 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.300
 this can be put 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.670
 of terror of technological action 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.060
 custom 3 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.170
 I believe that any of these parts 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.310
 customized is what the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.160
 option that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.650
 then he also asks me if I click on 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.459
 rss which is an option that the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.550
 helmets is also turned off and in 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.349
 position 2 the stereo plus booster 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.319
 serious I imagine that is reinforcement of 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.230
 serious, this will be from here going up 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.849
 the serious ones up I do not know what 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.720
 means or if it is the minimum option 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.390
 what will come 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 I give the button or not give notice 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.550
 quite a difference of the two ways 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.069
 it is a pass used to the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.010
 helmets that I have always used 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.950
 so 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.209
 It is not activated and in position 2 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.920
 envelope and bass reinforcement no longer 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.409
 I'm telling you, I'm going to try to make a party 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.209
 with him a party chat of this that I 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.629
 go explaining more or less how to put it 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.760
 and nothing to prove because as they say is 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.440
 changes very easy you are given the option to 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 it gives you to load or delete it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.340
 and it is already 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.370
 does not have much more good history then to 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.469
 see look here another question 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.969
 that make me good the most important is 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:37.810
 at 5 deactivated and in position 2 with 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:41.629
 preload of stoner or soccer mode 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.790
 using the helmet app is that no 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.799
 I know exactly what that means and 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.209
 activated and in position 2 with recharge in 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.959
 So this before by baby 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:55.700
 helmets option 5 and 6 I do not understand 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.620
 exactly the hiv ss the truth that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.599
 it shows quite 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.950
 in fact to have it connected to no 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.950
 have it connected is 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.260
 take helmets and not have them 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.250
 wireless and plug in the remote control 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.189
 plug in the control from jack to jack it 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.329
 listen without being the noise of this 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.489
 envelope when you put the vs that 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.759
 wireless and connect to command or anything 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.180
 of that when it shows quite 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:28.460
 difference 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.960
 Well nothing if you want any more questions 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.770
 some doubt then you do not have more than 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.389
 say it and put it 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.389
 in the ps4 forum 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.440
 and that's it and I'm happy I'll answer 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.440
 come a greeting and until another
