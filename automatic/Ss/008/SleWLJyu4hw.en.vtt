 Good. Let's start doing this. 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.510
 macaggi we're going to do theft because 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:11.180
 month of May - nor of mothers months away and 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:16.880
 everybody likes flowers at that time 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 so here I have the already cut mold 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.580
 right of the page mark 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.420
 I'm going to need the tourists petals. 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.340
 receives in the mold and has two forms of 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.160
 mount this brand page and I go 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.870
 to explain to you we also have 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:41.780
 and the leaves are for this we'll use 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:44.420
 an iron or iron or that seal 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.480
 Smells like what you guys usually wear 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.460
 we do not use modelers to value 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.100
 also the scorer 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.750
 the goleador I usually use to that because 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
 He is dino heavy and helps me 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.150
 because I have no strength in my hand then 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.040
 he does better he volleys better but 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.060
 you can buy biscuit 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.720
 I wanted that if the UN comes from playing games and leaving 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.379
 more in quetta and we will also use a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.680
 glue and that we'll make myself 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.930
 I'm going to vote first on the yellow flower. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:26.590
 the yellow flower she needs a key 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:29.590
 big and two small so I go 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.840
 take the hexa there 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.230
 This is how I got here. 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.180
 the wooden flannel flag 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.650
 I took a piece of foam board 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.219
 same size 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.389
 put the foam in my hand and cover with 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.909
 paper has to be cotton fabric 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.650
 Because how hot it will be if you 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.040
 use polyester 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.859
 it can ruin not only send more 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 tissue can burn just to not stay 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:04.269
 appearing the wood I put the interest 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.959
 Dinho that was underneath exeter good there 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:14.139
 so we'll warm up first, I'll go 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:16.889
 warm up to the great I warm 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.889
 two petals 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:28.000
 I bring her here she even does the 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:32.530
 enroladinho and down here and I sink 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.959
 Now you can make two more stones in the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.310
 Legs that want us can do more 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.769
 but in this great I put her so 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:49.479
 I come with this bigger ball of this 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:54.340
 ac play and there are five then one 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:04:00.220
 I could have done all three of this 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.000
 here is zero and I bent so petals to 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.280
 low 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.909
 done this here I have to see the name 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.879
 flax only a part of my link is what 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.629
 gives pull even in the iron and go with the 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.449
 smaller ball to do this as I go 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:21.000
 Lift you to see how it looks 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:25.190
 when I down 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.320
 so I made this stone 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.610
 Now I'm going to make the little one 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.810
 little tiny 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.730
 How very small and fast I go? 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.360
 around here at once 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.330
 I'll put it here if she stays. 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.990
 before I join before I 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.090
 to finish thrashing she does not know how I 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.930
 I'll wait to dry for you. 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.730
 if I were to debut it would be 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:04.820
 Cool, it's okay, you're welcome. 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:06.200
 is an athlete who needs and done it 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.940
 I come by the name of the linen 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.870
 You saw that I came with the petals. 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.720
 outside that is not to warp this 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:20.060
 I do what I did the same size 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 the ball because I will fit this 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.820
 petal here 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.170
 It's but after that I'm going to do it now. 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.430
