dance floor the best way they can
that<00:01:49.470> means<00:01:49.790> men<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.060> trying<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> outshine

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
that means men not trying to outshine

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
that means men not trying to outshine
the<00:01:52.380> ladies<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> men<00:01:53.820> should

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the ladies I think that the men should

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.499 
the ladies I think that the men should
really<00:01:54.450> try<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.700> gear<00:01:56.700> their<00:01:56.909> turn<00:01:57.119> patterns

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
really try to gear their turn patterns

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
really try to gear their turn patterns
depending<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> lady<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> dancing<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
depending on the lady the dancing one I

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.429 
depending on the lady the dancing one I
think<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> man<00:02:00.210> also<00:02:01.170> made<00:02:01.350> me

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
think that if the man also made me

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.040 
think that if the man also made me
members<00:02:01.799> too

some stories where a woman are not as

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.980 
some stories where a woman are not as

nice for the man who are starting out
and<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.830> men<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.160> even<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.460> harder

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and I think the men have even a harder

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.040 
and I think the men have even a harder
job<00:02:28.880> because<00:02:29.150> they<00:02:29.270> have<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.540> remember<00:02:29.780> so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
job because they have to remember so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
job because they have to remember so
many<00:02:30.200> combinations<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.070> they<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.430> put

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
many combinations and they have to put

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.790 
many combinations and they have to put
them<00:02:31.820> together<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:33.320> know<00:02:33.410> they<00:02:33.560> want<00:02:33.740> to

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
them together and you know they want to

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.080 
them together and you know they want to
look<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.220> want<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.460> look<00:02:34.580> good<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.880> front<00:02:34.940> of

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
look they want to look good in front of

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.760 
look they want to look good in front of
the<00:02:35.150> lady<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:36.200> hard<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.710> know

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
the lady and it's hard and I know

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.670 
the lady and it's hard and I know
sometimes<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:38.540> ladies<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:38.990> we<00:02:39.380> can<00:02:39.560> be<00:02:39.650> a

little<00:02:39.920> mean<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.090> think<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:42.050> have<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
little mean and I think that we have to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.410 
little mean and I think that we have to
try<00:02:43.130> not<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.460> be<00:02:43.610> because<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.090> don't<00:02:44.240> want<00:02:44.360> to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
try not to be because we don't want to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.330 
try not to be because we don't want to
decrease<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.380> confidence<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:45.980> guy<00:02:46.160> we

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
decrease the confidence of the guy we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.680 
decrease the confidence of the guy we
want<00:02:46.520> him<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.700> come<00:02:46.880> back<00:02:47.030> out<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.450> try<00:02:47.630> it
