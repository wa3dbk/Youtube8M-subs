00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it a little better i think it was ten

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.979 
it a little better i think it was ten
dollars<00:00:46.199> more<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.340> option<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
dollars more to get this option but it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.360 
dollars more to get this option but it
looks<00:00:49.230> nice<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.789> modern<00:00:51.059> looking

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
looks nice and it's very modern looking

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.180 
looks nice and it's very modern looking
so<00:00:54.770> we<00:00:55.770> need<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> take<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:57.350> little<00:00:58.350> top<00:00:58.620> insert

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so we need to take the little top insert

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:10.580 
so we need to take the little top insert
out<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:01.699> fill<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.960> to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> waterline

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.130 

comes<00:01:11.590> with<00:01:11.710> this<00:01:11.920> neat<00:01:12.220> little<00:01:13.860> cup<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:16.390> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
comes with this neat little cup now the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.240 
comes with this neat little cup now the
difference<00:01:17.380> is<00:01:17.860> that<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.650> unit<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.830> bamboo

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
difference is that this unit the bamboo

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.580 
difference is that this unit the bamboo
unit<00:01:21.700> can<00:01:21.940> be<00:01:21.970> filled<00:01:22.360> with<00:01:22.480> regular<00:01:23.170> tap

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
unit can be filled with regular tap

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.350 
unit can be filled with regular tap
water<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.600> other<00:01:25.780> unit<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:27.360> originally

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
water the other unit that originally

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
water the other unit that originally
comes<00:01:28.660> with<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.020> kit<00:01:29.230> you<00:01:29.890> have<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.340> use

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
comes with the kit you have to use

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.180 
comes with the kit you have to use
distilled<00:01:31.960> water<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.120> I<00:01:34.800> think<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.130> is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
distilled water and I think that this is

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.600 
distilled water and I think that this is
a<00:01:36.340> little<00:01:36.580> more<00:01:36.700> convenient<00:01:37.570> than<00:01:37.890> having<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
a little more convenient than having to

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.670 
a little more convenient than having to
buy<00:01:40.270> jugs<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.870> distilled<00:01:41.260> water<00:01:43.260> let's<00:01:44.260> plug

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
it's nice it has a little light on the

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:07.350 
it's nice it has a little light on the
bottom<00:01:58.319> it's<00:01:59.319> a<00:01:59.380> nice<00:01:59.530> calming<00:02:00.159> light

and<00:03:18.200> then<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.440> off<00:03:18.560> switch<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:21.110> really

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
and then the off switch that's a really

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:30.640 
and then the off switch that's a really
nice<00:03:22.100> feature<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.670> think<00:03:28.000> okay<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.410> let's<00:03:30.410> turn

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
nice feature I think okay so let's turn

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.229 
nice feature I think okay so let's turn
it<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:33.860> already<00:03:34.130> see<00:03:34.910> mist

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
it on and you can already see mist

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.630 
it on and you can already see mist
coming<00:03:35.510> out<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.959> top<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.880> can<00:03:37.880> barely<00:03:38.150> see

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
coming out of the top I can barely see

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.150 
coming out of the top I can barely see
but<00:03:40.640> it's<00:03:40.820> there<00:03:41.200> it's<00:03:42.200> coming<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.709> up<00:03:42.920> and

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
but it's there it's coming right up and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.479 
but it's there it's coming right up and
that<00:03:43.370> was<00:03:43.690> almost<00:03:44.709> automatic<00:03:45.709> but<00:03:46.280> that

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
that was almost automatic but that

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.720 
that was almost automatic but that
happened<00:03:46.940> because<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:48.650> saw<00:03:48.890> how<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.100> flip<00:03:49.610> the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
happened because you saw how I flip the

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.270 
happened because you saw how I flip the
switch<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.270> if<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:51.470> steam<00:03:51.739> starts<00:03:52.100> coming

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
switch and if the steam starts coming

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.870 
switch and if the steam starts coming
off<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.930> already<00:03:54.110> smells<00:03:54.700> wonderful<00:03:56.170> so

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
off and it already smells wonderful so

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.690 
off and it already smells wonderful so
there's<00:03:58.880> my<00:03:59.239> video<00:03:59.600> on<00:03:59.989> The<00:04:00.530> Young<00:04:00.920> Living
