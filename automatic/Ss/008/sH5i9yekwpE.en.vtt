00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.550
 Thanks to Yael, because she invited us to visit the Eco-Ambassador to enjoy many animals and plants 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.910
 What does Eco-Ambassador mean? 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.210
 First, the eco-ambassador has a special building, resembling a hemispherical hemisphere as Tren 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 It is built of glass and is triangles which are considered the basic building unit in the composition of the pistols 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 But there are not only pistols here, because if we had only pistols - we would have a cell resembling a hive 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.820
 So how can we build this curved shape? 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.750
 There are also sitcoms here, which help to form stereos, just like football, 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.080
 If you check football, there are also pistols and pistols 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.630
 The Eco-Ambassador is composed of two words: Eco and Ambassador 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.680
 ECOS - means an environment, a house and an ambassador - means a sphere - just like the building we are in 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.340
 Is eco-ambassador a greenhouse? 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.590
 No, the eco-ambassador is not a greenhouse, it's true that the sun enters here all the time 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.950
 But there is an air conditioning system here that softens the atmosphere 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.950
 The conditions of the Eco-Ambassador are monitored to remain constant 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.110
 25 Â° C and humidity 50 to 60% 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.740
 These conditions are relatively favorable conditions for the quality of plants present here 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.180
 They also need constant conditions such as those provided 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.400
 This is the "Vietnamese stick" 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.180
 This "stick" is not here, so we get it from the Eastern countries 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.150
 It is a species of insects and family bacillus 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.030
 As you see, what do you look like -? Stick- 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.990
 Looks exactly like a stick, why do you do this? - To camouflage 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 For camouflage, who can prey on it? Animals larger than them - 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.990
 Yup! Animals larger than they can prey on, birds, for example 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.640
 In order to protect themselves from predators, they hide themselves 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.400
 It can also change its color to green - 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.400
 This insect can not change its color, but its color changes over the course of its life 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.260
 But it does not change the color of chameleon you know 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.700
 This is the color at maturity 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.970
 But, as you can see, they are very similar to these brown-colored twigs 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.370
 Can I feel it - my cheek gives me a sense like? - a stick 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.490
 Yes, it's as rough as a stick 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.430
 And sometimes as you see, it does not stand up ... it does not move too, it really stands on the branches 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.400
 Without movement - so that its predators do not see it 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.810
 -Oh I've found one that does not move - excellent! Excellent! How do you like the stick here? 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.840
 - It's completely camouflaged itself, so can not fly over it 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.400
 To distinguish them 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.000
 Suppose she escaped from the Eco-Ambassador. Can she live abroad? 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.180
 Apparently she will not survive abroad, she has many enemies 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.310
 While the garden stick can live here abroad I'm sure you know it, when it's small and green 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.960
 This is another species of bacillus living here in our country 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.730
 But these can not live in external nature 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.000
 What do you feed? 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.430
 The Vietnamese stick feeds on the roses, which are very tasty 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.780
 Rose leaves, little eucalyptus paper and perhaps also foliage 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.990
 But they are vegetarian and not predatory 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.910
 As you also see, it does not have any wings that it is unable to fly 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.580
 She also has no jumping feet so she is unable to jump like grasshoppers 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.010
 We have here predatory plants of different species 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.690
 Uh .. Where do the predatory plants come from? 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.930
 Predatory plants grow ... especially in the tropics of the world 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.770
 It also exists in Eastern Europe - in different regions 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.790
 Are there predatory plants in our country? 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.980
 Yes, here too in our country there are predatory plants, there is one plant called water carriers (octopus plant) 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.070
 Aquatic plants, which prey on these plants, but they do not exist in nature outside 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.170
 Is this a permanent size or does it have a larger size than this? 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.360
 Now you see the thumbnail of these plants but they are able to grow and their size can be bigger than you see here 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.930
 As we know, man is more powerful than predatory plants, which means that when you enter your finger, you are still able to take it out easily. 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.390
 Where the simple insect can not escape 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.280
 Are you all prey in the same way? 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.820
 No, each one here has a different way. Let's explain more 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.670
 This plant is called "flyworm" 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.660
 His catch is the principle of closure (strangulation) as you see here, his papers mouth 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.860
 And toothpicks, these thorns (inside this mouth and in each hand there are three bristles 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.460
 These capillaries are used as stimuli for movement 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.800
 Suppose that a small insect, or an ant, for example, entered among these papers in order to find food there 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.620
 After you enter, these capillaries feel their movement 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.680
 Then the plant closes its leaves on it 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.630
 After a while, the plant chews it, has no teeth 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.750
 In fact, the secretion of substances, mostly proteins, enzymes, and acid 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.990
 Just like the acids in our saliva or stomach that help digest food 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.740
 Thus, the plant secrete these materials that analyze the insect 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.280
 While the plant absorbs the materials needed for Dakhla. This is a closing trap 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.030
 This plant, called the dew of the sun, because, if you look carefully, you will distinguish the leaves 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.790
 Covered with drops of dew these droplets are a very strong adhesive 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.940
 This is its catch: the insects that come to the plant stick 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.470
 The intensity of her astonishment begins with the movement 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.270
 Which makes them stick more and more, and then start to close the plant in this way 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.630
 Then fertilize it: The plant secrete the same materials that analyze the insect 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.970
 This plant has an additional trap, called this plant name of the tubia (or potted pitchers) 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.950
 The trap here depends on the principle of falling 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.750
 In most cases, flying insects fall inside 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.350
 Because it smells good to attract insects, which you think will find food inside 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.070
 Insects enter the inside, facing a small pond at the bottom of the trap 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.420
 Which contain, ... fall insects and do not succeed in getting out of there 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.270
 In the end, the same material is analyzed 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.790
 This is not a closed lid but it simply hinders the exit of insects 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.390
 (Cover also prevents rain from entering) 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.030
 Wow how beautiful this is! Thank you for allowing us to visit this place - with pleasure -
