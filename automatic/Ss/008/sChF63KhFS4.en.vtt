00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.660
And welcome back to thecrochetcrowd.com.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.660
I'm you host Mickey. Today I'm gonna show you how

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.660
to operate one of my snowflake patterns

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.420
and this is really simple. So I'm just using a size

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.320
'H', 5 mm crochet hook and I'm just using some Super Saver yarn today.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.120
What we're going to be doing is creating a slipknot

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.640
like so and this is a really simple pattern.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.800
And we're just gonna put it on the hook and we are going to chain four.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.120
Remember the one on the hook never counts as one.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.200
So 1, 2, 3 and 4 and let's join it with a slip stitch with the beginning chain

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.360
like so to create the center ring.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360
And let's pull through and now we have a ring.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Just like so.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.440
Now what we're going to do is our snowflake has six points.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.720
So we're gonna to start off and we're going to chain three.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.040
Remember that in the rules of crochet that the chaining of three to start with counts

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.560
as a double crochet for the most part.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.560
So now we're going to double crochet back

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.360
into the center of that ring once again.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Just like so.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360
And now we're going to chain three,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.480
so 1, 2 and 3.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.520
And let's come back into the center of that ring for two more double crochets.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.480
So we're essentially creating two, uh, like groups of two for double crochet being together.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.220
And then once we have those two done let's chain three.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.920
Got it, and let's double crochet two more times back into the ring

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.940
and now we're half way around.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.660
Let's chain three, 1 and 2 and 3, come back in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.780
and do two more double crochets into the center ring.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
Chain three, 1, 2 and 3.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.940
Coming back into the center ring

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.600
and we're doing two more double crochets

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
and we need a total of six of these

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
so we got 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.580
and then let's chain three, 1, 2, and 3

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.180
and let's double crochet two more times back into that center ring

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.280
to create the six point that we need.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.280
And remember to join it.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.720
We cannot just join now, we have to chain three,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.340
1, 2 and 3 and join it  with the top at the beginning.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.340
chain three that we started with

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.820
and that is the center point so far of your snowflake.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
Let's create the next - - -

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.040
Let's begin the next round.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.200
We need to slip stitch over to the next

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.000
gapping space right here.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.880
So we're going to just slip stitch on top of the next double crochet

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.740
that you can find and then just slip stitch right into that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.520
gapping space so that we can start there.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.180
So where we started has to be in the gap.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.240
Now we're going to chain three, 1, 2 and 3

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.100
and we're gonna double crochet three more time back into this gapping space.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100
Just like so.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.300
Now we're going to chain one only and jump to the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.140
next gapping space and we're gonna double crochet four times

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.140
and the four times is what we need

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.140
when we started that first one we needed to do

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.740
that chaining of three to begin

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.620
but remember those chaining of three counts as a double crochet

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.620
so that's why its like that.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.440
Once you get your four in there just chain one and again double crochet

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.440
four more time into the next gap

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.440
and so you're gonna have six gaps therefore

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.560
you'll have six of these going around.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.160
Once you get your four in chain one and then

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.440
double crochet back into the next gap that you can find.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.440
So the gapping makes it really easy,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440
you don't really have to look for any stitches.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.660
The trick is, is where to begin when you're going for each round.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.060
Chain one and now let's do four more into the next one.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.880
Okay, and we are

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.920
almost done with this round and let's chain one

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.460
and we have the last gap to go.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.200
So we're gonna put in our four.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.820
Now we can't just join it. We gotta make sure we chain one first.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.800
And then join it with the top of the beginning chain three.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800
And we just have one more round to go.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.760
And that's what it looks like at this point.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.500
To begin the next round we're in the wrong space

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.360
and we need to slip stitch all the way to the first gapping.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.040
So we're just gonna on to the top of the beginning

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.300
of the double crochet and just continually slip stitch

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.440
on each of those stitches until we get to the next gapping space.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.180
And so go right into the gapping space

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.820
and let's begin at this point.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.820
To begin, we're just gonna chain five so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.380
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.960
And then we're gonna slip stitch into this gap.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.960
And then we're gonna chain five again,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.720
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, slip stitch back into that same gap.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.100
Now we're going to chain seven.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.180
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 so it's a longer chain,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.120
and then back into that gap

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.120
for a slip stitch, chain five,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.900
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.220
back into that same gapping area

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.840
and then do it one more time.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.980
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and back into that first slip stitch.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.980
So you should have a total here  of five different points.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.740
So you got the loops, 1, 2 the biggest one is on top, 3, 4 and 5.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.980
So basically, once you're in the middle space

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.100
just slip stitch across the top of the next four double crochets

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.100
to take you to the next space.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.040
And I'm gonna review that one more time because you have to do that same thing

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.500
on all points. So you're into the next gap space

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500
so slip stitch first and then do five so

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.540
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.460
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and in for a slip stitch

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.680
and then seven, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480
So we got two more to go

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.800
and then five, so 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.800
Back in

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.660
and then 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.620
and back in and so then once you're in the middle

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.380
space here is that we're going to slip stitch across

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.940
the four double crochets

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.680
and begin the same process going all around.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.920
Let me get this done off camera and I'll be back

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920
and make sure you slip stitch into the next gap

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920
before you start chaining the next one.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.720
And when I come back I'll show you how to fasten off.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720
When you get all the way back to the start

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.720
we've already slipped stitched across this section

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.700
and we just have to join it with a slip stitch

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.920
right at the end and then fasten off and then weave in your ends.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.140
And then you just have to pull things just around just to be able to

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.900
get it to go in balance. And that's how you do one of these simple snowflakes.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.780
And again this is a free pattern and enjoy.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.940
Until next time, I'm Mikey from thecrochetcrowd.com
