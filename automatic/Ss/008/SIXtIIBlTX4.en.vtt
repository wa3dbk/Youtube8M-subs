the first thing I will demonstrate is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.020 
the first thing I will demonstrate is
the<00:00:36.059> stasis<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.630> biotic<00:00:36.899> charge<00:00:37.290> combo<00:00:38.030> as

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the stasis and biotic charge combo as

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
the stasis and biotic charge combo as
you<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.620> resulting<00:00:41.100> biotic

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you can see here the resulting biotic

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.200 
you can see here the resulting biotic
explosion<00:00:42.120> killed<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> assault<00:00:42.899> trooper

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.880 

next<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> stasis<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.320> heavy<00:00:49.590> melee

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
next we have a stasis and heavy melee

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.279 
next we have a stasis and heavy melee
combo<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:53.090> as<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.719> although

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
combo and as you can see here although

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.970 
combo and as you can see here although
effective<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.489> no<00:00:56.699> bionic<00:00:57.149> detonation

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
effective there was no bionic detonation

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.380 
effective there was no bionic detonation
here<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.219> again<00:00:59.870> on<00:01:01.460> tougher<00:01:02.460> enemies<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
here it is again on tougher enemies you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.530 
here it is again on tougher enemies you
can<00:01:03.570> try<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> triple<00:01:04.229> combo<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.729> stasis

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
can try a triple combo that is stasis

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.240 
can try a triple combo that is stasis
heavy<00:01:07.020> melee<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> finally<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> biotic<00:01:08.670> charge

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.010 

suffice<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> say<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.180> Nemesis<00:01:15.630> did<00:01:15.810> not

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
suffice it to say the Nemesis did not

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.669 
suffice it to say the Nemesis did not
survive

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.050 

sometimes<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.859> stasis<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> Bionic<00:01:20.789> charge

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
sometimes the stasis and Bionic charge

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
sometimes the stasis and Bionic charge
combo<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.929> not<00:01:22.109> result<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.619> an<00:01:22.770> explosion<00:01:23.039> as

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
combo will not result in an explosion as

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:33.080 
combo will not result in an explosion as
can<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> seen<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.990> prepared<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 

here<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.049> another<00:01:34.259> example<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> bionic

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
here is another example of a bionic

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
here is another example of a bionic
explosion<00:01:39.679> double<00:01:40.679> kill<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.960> another<00:01:48.960> double

explosion double kill and another double

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.190 
explosion double kill and another double
kill<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.219> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.759> biotic<00:01:51.600> explosions

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
kill so as you can see biotic explosions

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.809 
kill so as you can see biotic explosions
are<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> should<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.950> aiming<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.429> to

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
are what you should be aiming for to

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.870 
are what you should be aiming for to
inflict<00:01:54.179> maximum<00:01:54.360> damage<00:01:58.459> stasis<00:01:59.459> in<00:01:59.609> a<00:01:59.729> live

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
inflict maximum damage stasis in a live

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.849 
inflict maximum damage stasis in a live
grenade<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.719> also<00:02:00.899> result<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> biotic

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
grenade can also result in a biotic

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.219 
grenade can also result in a biotic
explosion<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.270> unable<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.569> cause<00:02:03.959> one

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
explosion but I was unable to cause one

explosion but I was unable to cause one
while<00:02:04.439> making<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.979> video

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:38.750 

you<00:02:13.250> got<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.190 

stasis<00:02:39.760> does<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:40.209> affect<00:02:40.569> armored<00:02:40.989> phones

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
stasis does not affect armored phones

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.350 
stasis does not affect armored phones
but<00:02:41.769> biotic<00:02:42.160> explosions<00:02:42.790> near<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.209> will

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
but biotic explosions near them will

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.119 
but biotic explosions near them will
still<00:02:43.599> damage<00:02:44.019> them<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.830> very<00:02:44.860> least

a<00:03:03.689> few<00:03:04.689> more<00:03:04.810> biotic<00:03:05.260> explosions<00:03:05.920> before<00:03:06.099> we

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
a few more biotic explosions before we

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.520 
a few more biotic explosions before we
go

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
