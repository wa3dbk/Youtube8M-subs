00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.180

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.310
 with a movie of this that is a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 We do not go to training 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 put here at the conchi fortress 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.960
 let's stick there with the name of the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.979
 it is told that we have behind us and 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.229
 above says to call him but this 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.450
 it's paper that vacilÃ³n good guys we're going 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.159
 to see how it works this I say that 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.470
 the test a little bit and that's always been 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.280
 caught little because he is a fighter of 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.280
 wrestling 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.310
 with the knife 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.600
 in this way fight functions and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.530
 machete this as very caught to get me out 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.530
 all caught before 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 we will take the resolution mode 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.270
 strinati lyrics as a kind of things 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.860
 rare and do the catches that you have for 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.369
 that you see it there is we have a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.800
 search all the word 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.120
 is that your little reminds me of me in the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.640
 strain that was bigger than it was all 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.860
 caught can do the activity as 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 adwords from back to chosen and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.630
 remains the same is unequivocal and to the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.610
 final is that this totally welcomed that 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.610
 put these characters 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.560
 we will have to work online 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.989
 I think the followers of the places 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.050
 are fallen to catch him with the king still 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.830
 being the same 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.610
 how bust 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.230
 to you 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.910
 and also that we will give the video 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.910
 to teach 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.830
 because well done and all 8 all 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.740
 the fact that I have done absolutely 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.080
 All we have nothing more to give have 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.080
 been all combos of catching a killer 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.440
 it's been super free although we're going to do 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.240
 the end screen install I'm going to make it 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.900
 this down 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.800

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.360
 way to fight and if we go vote of 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.400

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.440
 next video will be online or also be 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.910
 of the last combat mode that has 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.770
 jason I like to practice them a little bit 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.480
 to be able to show you with certainty the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.340
 movements that make the most striking 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.810
 this last one I liked a lot 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.640
 how he has taken the stamp against 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.780

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.870
 always leave data or the others that do not 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.090
 he remembers me was a predator and a 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.280
 man and a woman if I'm not wrong and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.660
