 it will be provided to spin in one word 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:36.580
 in a word spin 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.850
 k there will be more command tasks will be 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.790
 more effectively solved if all 4 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.740
 player guta are scorching exactly people with 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.760

 solution now have the players but would 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.150
 full could that is if play

 electronic spray goes under 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.320
 system update 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.380
 however if you want to go through some 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.940
 from side missions then look at 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.620
 requirement if 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.820
 requires all four clever top 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.470
 recruit four people 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.650
 see and if you are less than four 2

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.350
 task 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.690
 very important 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.420
 as far as mobs goes such will not 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.510
 much smaller is the topic with which we 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.210
 trunc emily of course they were 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.540
 better than those electronic soldiers who 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.140
 doing your duty you know where but 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.110
 in practice 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:53.280
 special weather made him as much as six 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.650

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.440
 for the life of a unit to carry cartridges 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.930

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.120

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.680

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:18.150
 enough why I developed this topic 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.150
 teamwork blogs when i matter in 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.500
 tom this will also be reflected in the plot 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.860
 some tasks will contain 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:31.050
 various unexpected turns about which 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.390
 will only know certain gratis 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.690
 which directly participated in 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.370
 under one or another side missions and 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.200
 plot, too, that create such 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.800
 atmosphere sims 3 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.140
 knowledge of the big picture through not be afraid 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.740

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.800
 school loyal 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.760
 although someone already 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.060
 and as usual 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.020
 what i use is miserable crumbs of free 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.520
 time therefore 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:07.100
 despicable by the script and I ran no classes 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.440
 will have the most unique abilities 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.980
 because of which the game will go beyond the shooter 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.980
 first person 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:21.760
 the answer will be the class about which I 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:30.850
 I'll tell you next right in rhyme 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:30.850

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.860
 Sisi will beat 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.530
 order 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:53.530
 parables 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.830
 but
