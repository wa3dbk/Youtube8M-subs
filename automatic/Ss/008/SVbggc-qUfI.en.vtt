to a car dealer prices are probably

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.080 
to a car dealer prices are probably
going<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.199> be<00:04:51.430> more<00:04:52.430> expensive<00:04:52.729> if<00:04:53.030> you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
going to be more expensive if you

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.620 
going to be more expensive if you
compare<00:04:53.509> to<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:54.020> UK<00:04:54.380> probably<00:04:54.590> right<00:04:55.630> let's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
compare to the UK probably right let's

you<00:05:03.889> half<00:05:03.919> in<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.430> UK<00:05:04.729> but<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:05.930> don't<00:05:06.080> realize

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
you half in the UK but you don't realize

that<00:05:06.460> although<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:07.759> cheaper<00:05:08.150> at<00:05:08.599> the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
that although it's cheaper at the

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.200 
that although it's cheaper at the

you<00:05:50.120> know<00:05:50.210> we<00:05:50.330> send<00:05:50.570> engineers<00:05:51.550> overseas

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
you know we send engineers overseas

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.589 
you know we send engineers overseas
they're<00:05:52.669> not<00:05:52.789> even<00:05:53.000> creating<00:05:53.270> enough<00:05:53.449> right

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
they're not even creating enough right

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.170 
they're not even creating enough right
now<00:05:53.630> proton<00:05:54.380> is<00:05:54.560> there<00:05:54.800> not<00:05:55.490> just<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.969> sell

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
now proton is there not just to sell

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.060 
now proton is there not just to sell
cars<00:05:56.360> it's<00:05:56.719> also<00:05:56.870> there<00:05:57.139> to<00:05:57.169> develop<00:05:57.650> our<00:05:57.860> own

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
differs from Thailand where you bring in

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.999 
differs from Thailand where you bring in
someone<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:03.169> just<00:06:03.409> develop<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.860> ultimate

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
someone to just develop the ultimate

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
here is the matter of improving it and

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.080 
here is the matter of improving it and

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
probably you know setting a right

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.670 
probably you know setting a right
direction<00:06:11.360> in<00:06:11.630> how<00:06:11.750> we<00:06:11.810> want<00:06:12.139> to<00:06:12.289> make<00:06:12.530> sure

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.110 
direction in how we want to make sure
that<00:06:12.830> it's<00:06:12.979> competitive<00:06:13.250> so<00:06:13.849> what<00:06:13.969> we've

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
that it's competitive so what we've

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.939 
that it's competitive so what we've
learned<00:06:14.419> is<00:06:14.659> that<00:06:14.719> the<00:06:14.870> main<00:06:15.110> reason<00:06:15.139> why<00:06:15.650> cars

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
learned is that the main reason why cars

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.890 
learned is that the main reason why cars
cost<00:06:16.280> so<00:06:16.430> much<00:06:16.580> in<00:06:16.729> Malaysia<00:06:17.000> is<00:06:17.360> because<00:06:17.719> we

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
cost so much in Malaysia is because we

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.560 
cost so much in Malaysia is because we
have<00:06:18.199> the<00:06:18.620> national<00:06:19.219> automotive<00:06:19.570> policy

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
have the national automotive policy

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.270 
have the national automotive policy
that's<00:06:20.750> right<00:06:20.990> we<00:06:21.259> have<00:06:21.409> proton<00:06:21.830> what's

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
that's right we have proton what's

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.980 
that's right we have proton what's
interesting<00:06:22.550> though<00:06:22.909> is<00:06:23.150> that<00:06:23.360> this<00:06:23.690> is<00:06:23.840> not

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
interesting though is that this is not

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.649 
interesting though is that this is not
just<00:06:24.349> about<00:06:24.620> creating<00:06:24.889> a<00:06:25.340> national<00:06:25.969> car<00:06:26.240> it's

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
just about creating a national car it's

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.439 
just about creating a national car it's
about<00:06:26.780> creating<00:06:27.229> a<00:06:27.409> national<00:06:27.919> automotive

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
about creating a national automotive

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.790 
about creating a national automotive
industry<00:06:29.449> so<00:06:29.780> basically<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.259> gamble<00:06:30.620> was

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
industry so basically the gamble was

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.520 
industry so basically the gamble was
that<00:06:31.310> using<00:06:32.300> proton<00:06:32.750> and<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.080> National

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
that using proton and the National

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.890 
that using proton and the National
motive<00:06:33.800> industry<00:06:34.190> we<00:06:34.580> can<00:06:34.729> build<00:06:34.969> a<00:06:35.240> high-tech

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
motive industry we can build a high-tech

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.959 
motive industry we can build a high-tech
industry<00:06:36.500> that<00:06:36.830> Malaysia<00:06:37.159> can<00:06:37.430> use<00:06:37.639> to

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 
industry that Malaysia can use to

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:39.700 
industry that Malaysia can use to
industrialize<00:06:38.599> in<00:06:39.020> order<00:06:39.260> for<00:06:39.380> that<00:06:39.500> to<00:06:39.560> work

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
industrialize in order for that to work

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.800 
industrialize in order for that to work
though<00:06:40.010> we<00:06:40.460> as<00:06:40.610> Malaysians<00:06:41.150> needed<00:06:41.510> to<00:06:41.599> buy

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
though we as Malaysians needed to buy

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.310 
though we as Malaysians needed to buy
many<00:06:42.620> many<00:06:42.949> men

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
many many men

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.280 
many many men
many<00:06:43.680> of<00:06:44.160> these<00:06:44.610> cars<00:06:44.910> in<00:06:45.390> order<00:06:45.600> to<00:06:45.810> help<00:06:45.990> us

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
many of these cars in order to help us

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.130 
many of these cars in order to help us
encourage<00:06:46.560> us<00:06:47.130> to<00:06:47.520> buy<00:06:47.700> these<00:06:47.760> cars<00:06:48.150> they<00:06:48.810> the

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
encourage us to buy these cars they the

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.230 
encourage us to buy these cars they the
government<00:06:49.260> put<00:06:49.710> in<00:06:49.830> Texas<00:06:50.340> they<00:06:50.910> put<00:06:51.150> in

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
government put in Texas they put in

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.840 
government put in Texas they put in
approved<00:06:51.600> permits<00:06:52.110> on<00:06:52.340> imported<00:06:53.340> cars<00:06:53.580> to

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
basically what this did is the base

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.510 
basically what this did is the base
price<00:06:57.510> of<00:06:57.720> all<00:06:57.960> cars<00:06:58.230> even<00:06:58.650> secondhand<00:06:59.310> cars

price of all cars even secondhand cars

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.330 
price of all cars even secondhand cars
are<00:06:59.760> much<00:07:00.240> more<00:07:00.570> expensive<00:07:00.930> however<00:07:01.860> there

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
are much more expensive however there

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.980 
are much more expensive however there
are<00:07:02.490> things<00:07:02.700> that<00:07:02.820> help<00:07:03.120> encourage<00:07:03.660> car

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
ownership so fuel in malaysia subsidized

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.600 
ownership so fuel in malaysia subsidized
which<00:07:07.140> brings<00:07:07.440> down<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.800> price<00:07:08.040> of<00:07:08.190> car
