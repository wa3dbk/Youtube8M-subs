00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.329
 hello I have something sweet today 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.219
 And there are today companies with chocolate 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.260
 I thought so 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.780
 or I'm doing as it goes away 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.330
 you too wenzel november will be and 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.700
 So it comes out and the outside 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.250
 Christmas time you get lust too 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.990
 cookies and what sweet and that's why 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.550
 I felt that way now 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.350
 Once a week I make myself a sweet 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.600
 lunch before there is a pointe 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.640
 soup falls with 0 friend or very little 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.960
 wood and then I'm doing for example 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.850
 so what about these pears with 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.370
 pudding woman i vouch for fresh me 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.390
 do today for 440 people so 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.070
 also four walls 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.410
 I will peel it in half afterwards 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.960
 We know that today rausnehmen and then 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.020
 hope and only need in water 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.219
 without sugar for the poodle I need 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.079
 milk 40 grams of cornstarch 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.269
 dark chocolate to save points 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.430
 Let's use a chocolate that will 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.590
 with stand here made has since only 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.900
 a little more like half of the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.880
 friend of a normal chocolate is 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.320
 really worth it on such a stevia 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.040
 dodge chocolate 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.659
 then you need one egg and two 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.159
 tablespoon stevia you can also get one 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.670
 higher concentrated it stands we take 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.170
 but I use what you have from the volume 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.460
 use one to one for sugar 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.930
 then I do not have to worry so many 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.700
 to think how much there as pure 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.560
 It also has to do that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.320
 chocolate pudding just a bit fine 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.970
 taste 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.370
 I have the the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.750
 vanilla pod scratched out and with rather 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.970
 possible once boiled 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.010
 but you do not have to do that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.610
 just a little more flavor 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.920
 and that's all it is for me 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.910
 in the cold milk the stronger with 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.910
 Rainer that is 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.060
 under stevia so this is one 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.140
 Tablespoon measure I make easy now 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.880
 two is the whole with the mixstab through 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.210
 and but it seems sometimes even the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.210
 hertha 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.240
 I have the chocolate in one 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.430
 small mixa demanded that you then 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.800
 it quickly melts in the milk 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 The chocolate can have me too 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.300
 a series of easy tires I do 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.110
 already purely siblings and the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.110
 treated milk life 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.340
 then I will boil it up and that 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.930
 Whole time doing with the whisk 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.659
 stir so it does not hang down 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.909
 Now it starts to cook slowly 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.549
 as soon as it cooks from the stove and 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.230
 Distribute it over the citizens who have 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.600
 I have two half beer one 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.250
 made sting 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.230
 Although just not really 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.180
 homogeneous after cooking because of that 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.590
 I still in the magic wand or mixstab 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.510
 heard through a bit and now 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.510
 spread over the pears 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.190
 that's what it looks like now when I get that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.750
 pudding party over the pear 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.750
 boss now has six points
