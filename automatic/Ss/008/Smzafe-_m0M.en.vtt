title you can see this is the new Oakley
crank<00:00:54.600> case<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> said<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
crank case and like I said this is not a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
crank case and like I said this is not a
colorway<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> has<00:00:58.379> been<00:00:58.559> released<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
colorway that has been released I

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.260 
colorway that has been released I
believe<00:00:59.640> they<00:01:00.359> call<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.930> matte<00:01:01.859> dark<00:01:02.789> grey

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
believe they call this matte dark grey

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.109 
believe they call this matte dark grey
or<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.049> sorry<00:01:04.290> dark<00:01:05.010> grey<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.909> even

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
or I'm sorry dark grey I'm not even

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.510 
or I'm sorry dark grey I'm not even
quite<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.630> frame<00:01:06.810> color<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
quite sure the frame color it is a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.789 
quite sure the frame color it is a
different<00:01:08.520> color<00:01:08.760> frame<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.750> has<00:01:09.960> blue<00:01:10.290> icons

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
different color frame it has blue icons

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
different color frame it has blue icons
and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:12.030> has<00:01:12.180> grey<00:01:12.689> lenses<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:15.150> very

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and it has grey lenses so it's very very

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
and it has grey lenses so it's very very
similar<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.290> fuel-cell<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:17.070> pull

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
similar to the fuel-cell actually pull

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100 
similar to the fuel-cell actually pull
the<00:01:17.400> fuel-cell<00:01:17.640> out<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the fuel-cell out right here so you can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.320 
the fuel-cell out right here so you can
actually<00:01:19.259> compare<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.799> two

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
actually compare the two

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
actually compare the two
so<00:01:21.330> fuel<00:01:21.689> cell<00:01:21.930> versus<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:25.110> crank<00:01:25.380> case<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.159> as

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so fuel cell versus the crank case so as

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.109 
so fuel cell versus the crank case so as
you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:26.610> icons<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.900> similar<00:01:28.380> size<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you can see icons very similar size the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.760 
you can see icons very similar size the
facial<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> front<00:01:31.200> part<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> two

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
facial the front part of the two

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
facial the front part of the two
orbitals<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.750> different<00:01:34.170> as

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
orbitals is a little bit different as

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.200 
orbitals is a little bit different as
you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.400> crank<00:01:35.640> case<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
you can see the crank case is gonna be a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.120 
you can see the crank case is gonna be a
little<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:36.810> smaller<00:01:37.140> smaller<00:01:37.619> than<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> fuel

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
little bit smaller smaller than the fuel

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.749 
little bit smaller smaller than the fuel
cell<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.110> by<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.950> another<00:01:41.400> pair

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
cell but not by much so another pair

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389 
cell but not by much so another pair
that<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.970> figured<00:01:42.360> most<00:01:42.750> people<00:01:43.399> would

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that I figured most people would

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.920 
that I figured most people would
probably<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> comparison<00:01:45.810> with

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
probably want to see a comparison with

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.580 
probably want to see a comparison with
would<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> crank<00:01:46.829> case<00:01:47.390> with<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.750> gas<00:01:49.229> can

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
would be the crank case with the gas can

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
would be the crank case with the gas can
so<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> side<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:51.600> there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so as you can see the side right there

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.500 
so as you can see the side right there
with<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> gas<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
with the gas can

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.660 
with the gas can
in<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.530> crankcase<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.220> little<00:01:55.520> bit

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
in the crankcase it is a little bit

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.980 
in the crankcase it is a little bit
bigger<00:01:55.850> than<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.120> gas<00:01:56.300> can<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.750> would

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
bigger than the gas can so I would

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.140 
bigger than the gas can so I would
consider<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.710> happy<00:01:58.280> medium<00:01:58.670> between<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
consider this a happy medium between the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.080 
consider this a happy medium between the
fuel<00:01:59.960> cell<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.130> gas<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.610> now<00:02:01.790> this<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.060> a

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
fuel cell and the gas can now this is a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.690 
fuel cell and the gas can now this is a
great<00:02:02.390> frame<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.710> already<00:02:03.980> been<00:02:04.160> released<00:02:04.340> I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
great frame it's already been released I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.640 
great frame it's already been released I
think<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:05.150> two<00:02:05.510> or<00:02:05.630> three<00:02:05.780> weeks<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.200> and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
think for two or three weeks now and

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.200 
think for two or three weeks now and
this<00:02:06.980> just<00:02:07.190> been<00:02:07.340> such<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.610> good<00:02:07.820> seller<00:02:08.090> I

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
this just been such a good seller I

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.609 
this just been such a good seller I
think<00:02:08.510> this<00:02:08.630> will<00:02:08.869> be<00:02:08.990> one<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.170> oakley's<00:02:09.590> uh

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
think this will be one of oakley's uh

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.410 
think this will be one of oakley's uh
probably<00:02:10.460> one<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.790> their<00:02:10.880> best<00:02:11.120> selling

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
probably one of their best selling

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.460 
probably one of their best selling
products<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.110> year<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.350> feel<00:02:12.710> like<00:02:14.110> but<00:02:15.110> you

know it's just it's a it's a great
fitting<00:02:17.240> frame<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.630> would<00:02:17.870> say<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.290> fits

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
fitting frame I would say it fits

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500 
fitting frame I would say it fits
halfway<00:02:18.830> between<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.460> gas<00:02:19.790> can<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> fuel

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
halfway between the gas can and the fuel

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.300 
halfway between the gas can and the fuel
cell<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.020> already<00:02:21.260> said<00:02:21.470> they<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.070> some

white frame with Jade lenses and green

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.780 
white frame with Jade lenses and green
icons<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.440> has<00:02:51.620> some<00:02:51.830> really<00:02:52.190> really<00:02:52.610> cool

this<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.100> one<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.280> Oakley's<00:02:56.709> reasonably

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
this is one of Oakley's reasonably

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.190 
this is one of Oakley's reasonably
affording<00:02:58.330> pair<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.420> shades<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.840> think<00:03:00.020> this

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
affording pair of shades I think this

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.530 
affording pair of shades I think this
pair<00:03:00.490> with<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.580> grey<00:03:01.730> lenses<00:03:02.090> retails<00:03:02.480> for

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
pair with the grey lenses retails for

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.090 
pair with the grey lenses retails for
about<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.780> hundred<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.410> then<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> polarized

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
about a hundred and then the polarized

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.550 
about a hundred and then the polarized
is<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.520> 150<00:03:05.209> 160<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:06.230> not<00:03:06.500> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
is like 150 160 so it's not that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.740 
is like 150 160 so it's not that
expensive<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.730> think<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.420> gonna<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.720> a

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
expensive and I think this is gonna be a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.360 
expensive and I think this is gonna be a
great<00:03:09.080> summer<00:03:09.380> pickup<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.010> lot<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.280> you

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
great summer pickup for a lot of you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.530 
great summer pickup for a lot of you
guys<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.760> are<00:03:10.790> looking<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.300> pair<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
summer shades now I guess to get a

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.860 
summer shades now I guess to get a
little<00:03:13.580> bit<00:03:13.760> more<00:03:13.910> into<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.209> glasses<00:03:14.420> like<00:03:14.750> I

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
little bit more into the glasses like I

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.680 
little bit more into the glasses like I
said<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.050> think<00:03:15.140> they<00:03:15.440> call<00:03:15.680> this<00:03:15.920> just<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.880> gray

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
said I think they call this just a gray

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.380 
said I think they call this just a gray
just<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.230> gray<00:03:18.470> frame<00:03:18.880> now<00:03:19.880> one<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.270> did

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
just a gray frame now one thing I did

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.760 
just a gray frame now one thing I did
notice<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.690> seems<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.260> little<00:03:21.410> bit<00:03:21.500> different

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
notice that seems a little bit different

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.650 
notice that seems a little bit different
to<00:03:21.830> me<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.489> icons<00:03:22.850> actually<00:03:23.150> stick<00:03:23.360> out<00:03:23.510> of

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
to me is the icons actually stick out of

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.510 
to me is the icons actually stick out of
the<00:03:23.750> frame<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.709> as<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.130> see<00:03:25.220> when<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.459> open

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
the frame so as you can see when I open

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.370 
the frame so as you can see when I open
our<00:03:25.820> arm<00:03:26.000> with<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.420> arm<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.810> close<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
our arm with the arm and I close it the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.949 
our arm with the arm and I close it the
icons<00:03:27.739> still<00:03:28.010> stays<00:03:28.280> straight<00:03:28.610> out<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.780> me

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
icons still stays straight out and to me

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.570 
icons still stays straight out and to me
this<00:03:30.110> kind<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.380> seems<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.890> looks<00:03:31.430> a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
this kind of seems like that looks a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.390 
this kind of seems like that looks a
little<00:03:31.700> flimsy<00:03:32.030> like<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.510> might<00:03:32.720> break<00:03:33.110> off

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
little flimsy like that might break off

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.720 
little flimsy like that might break off
but<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.700> mean<00:03:35.270> it's<00:03:35.420> it's<00:03:35.750> held<00:03:35.959> up<00:03:36.110> so<00:03:36.320> far<00:03:36.730> so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730
