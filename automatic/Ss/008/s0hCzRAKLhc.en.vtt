00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.360
 for sale the fingerlings must be of 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.910
 fished with care 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.040
 is made with network size and more suitable 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.180
 thus preventing fingerlings from 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.580
 harm a procedure that can be 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 adopted to homogenize lots of 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.280
 facilitating their packaging and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.110
 giving them the best price is yours 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.809
 separation by size 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.170
 this can be done with the help of 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.629
 appropriate grids with a 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.489
 fingerlings are caught and placed in the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.160
 first grade 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.470
 some pass and stay apart 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.180
 the others are transferred to another 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.650
 grid where the process repeats itself 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.170
 this is done according to the quantity 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.630
 of sizes you want 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.000
 the fry before being packed 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.649
 must pass through a tank so that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.740
 Empty the tube 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.600
 digestive recommends following this tank 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.149
 cement and that the fry 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.119
 stay in it for 24 hours without 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.420
 receive food it is important that there be 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.520
 constant renewal of the water to 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.479
 determine the number of fingerlings for 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 packing 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.720
 A sieve is used to measure the thigh 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.850
 collect the fry with the sieve and 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.090
 account if your content 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.549
 repeat this procedure three times and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.580
 then an average of the counts 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.510
 being used with the standard for 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.799
 the subsequent determinations determined 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.060
 number of fingerlings 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.909
 now just pack the density of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.430
 transported fry is determined in 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.860
 their size and time 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.840
 transportation is generally carried 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.509
 2500 to 3000 two-to-five 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.149
 centimeters for six to 12 hours 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.970
 The most widely used packaging medium is 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.940
 plastic bag should be well 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.880
 resistant to transport this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.140
 number of levins are used 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.690
 approximately 12 liters of water 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.970
 should the volume remaining to be 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.970
 complete with oxygen under pressure 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:40.990
 it is important that the plastic bag is 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:44.880
 well tied the fingerlings so valued 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.880
 are ready for transport
