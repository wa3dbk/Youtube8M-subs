00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
of her head I don't know if you can see

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.230 
of her head I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:04.369> but<00:01:04.699> it's<00:01:05.239> not<00:01:05.360> my<00:01:05.479> favorite<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:07.210> what<00:01:08.210> I

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
that but it's not my favorite so what I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.620 
that but it's not my favorite so what I
have<00:01:08.630> done<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.790> can<00:01:10.939> do<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:11.180> also<00:01:11.360> if

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
have done and you can do this also if

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.359 
have done and you can do this also if
you've<00:01:11.750> got<00:01:11.930> somebody<00:01:12.680> with<00:01:12.860> thinner<00:01:13.100> hair

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
you've got somebody with thinner hair

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.940 
you've got somebody with thinner hair
because<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.909> makes<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.750> bun<00:01:14.899> look<00:01:15.140> bigger<00:01:15.439> as

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
because it makes the bun look bigger as

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.200 
because it makes the bun look bigger as
far<00:01:16.310> as<00:01:16.930> amount<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.140> hair<00:01:18.380> goes<00:01:18.969> so<00:01:19.969> I'll<00:01:20.060> just

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
far as amount of hair goes so I'll just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.749 
far as amount of hair goes so I'll just
show<00:01:20.389> you<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:20.920> what<00:01:21.920> I'll<00:01:22.039> do<00:01:22.219> is<00:01:22.340> I'll<00:01:22.490> go<00:01:22.609> and

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
show you so what I'll do is I'll go and

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.899 
show you so what I'll do is I'll go and
do<00:01:22.850> two<00:01:23.030> braids<00:01:23.329> and<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:25.490> can<00:01:25.639> do<00:01:25.729> these<00:01:25.850> as

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
do two braids and you can do these as

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.910 
do two braids and you can do these as
tight<00:01:26.869> or<00:01:27.200> as<00:01:27.289> loose<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:28.159> messy<00:01:28.429> as<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.700> want

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
tight or as loose and messy as you want

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.559 
tight or as loose and messy as you want
but<00:01:30.920> assuming<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.819> know<00:01:31.909> how<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.149> do<00:01:32.359> a<00:01:32.389> basic

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
but assuming you know how to do a basic

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:33.550 
but assuming you know how to do a basic
three<00:01:32.899> strand<00:01:33.259> braid

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
three strand braid

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.569 
three strand braid
it's<00:01:34.369> just<00:01:34.549> leftover<00:01:34.999> right<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:37.189> I<00:01:37.429> will

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
it's just leftover right and I will

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.599 
it's just leftover right and I will
break<00:01:37.759> down<00:01:37.999> as<00:01:38.240> far<00:01:38.420> as<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.659> can<00:01:38.719> go<00:01:39.049> and

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
break down as far as I can go and

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.469 
break down as far as I can go and
actually<00:01:40.609> I<00:01:41.240> do<00:01:41.600> like<00:01:41.959> to<00:01:42.170> make<00:01:42.200> these<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:43.479> bit

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
actually I do like to make these a bit

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.059 
actually I do like to make these a bit
looser<00:01:44.779> so<00:01:44.810> what<00:01:45.139> I'll<00:01:45.229> do<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:45.649> once<00:01:45.950> I

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
looser so what I'll do is that once I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.109 
looser so what I'll do is that once I
braided<00:01:46.279> down<00:01:46.609> I'll<00:01:47.240> kind<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:48.249> undo<00:01:49.249> some<00:01:50.090> of

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
braided down I'll kind of undo some of

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.690 
braided down I'll kind of undo some of
it<00:01:50.799> like<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.399> then<00:01:52.670> I'll<00:01:52.789> tie<00:01:52.999> it<00:01:53.119> off

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
it like this and then I'll tie it off

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.010 
it like this and then I'll tie it off
and<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.689> to<00:01:58.090> leave<00:01:59.090> my<00:01:59.119> ends<00:01:59.569> looped<00:01:59.810> like

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
and I like to leave my ends looped like

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.519 
and I like to leave my ends looped like
this<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:00.799> I<00:02:00.829> can<00:02:00.950> pull<00:02:01.429> them<00:02:01.549> an<00:02:02.389> increment<00:02:02.840> the

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
this so I can pull them an increment the

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:05.919 
this so I can pull them an increment the
bobby<00:02:04.130> pins<00:02:04.399> anyway<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.270> then<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.509> will<00:02:05.749> loosen

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
bobby pins anyway so then I will loosen

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.330 
bobby pins anyway so then I will loosen
up<00:02:06.139> the<00:02:06.289> braid<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.009> make<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.159> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
up the braid like this to make it a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.779 
up the braid like this to make it a
little<00:02:07.520> bit<00:02:07.700> chunkier<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.520> do<00:02:10.640> this

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
little bit chunkier and you can do this

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.030 
little bit chunkier and you can do this
probably<00:02:11.030> with<00:02:11.420> more<00:02:11.630> braised<00:02:12.470> than<00:02:12.740> just<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
probably with more braised than just the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.760 
probably with more braised than just the
two<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.930> our<00:02:15.080> way<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.260> doing<00:02:15.620> it

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
two but this is just our way of doing it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.830 
two but this is just our way of doing it
and<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.130> can<00:02:16.310> put<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.970> ponytail<00:02:17.360> anywhere<00:02:17.720> on

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and you can put the ponytail anywhere on

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.890 
and you can put the ponytail anywhere on
the<00:02:17.959> head<00:02:18.200> low<00:02:19.069> or<00:02:19.400> high<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> middle<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:20.810> on

the head low or high in the middle or on

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.350 
the head low or high in the middle or on
the<00:02:21.020> side<00:02:21.790> doesn't<00:02:22.790> really<00:02:23.030> matter

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070 

but<00:02:27.620> doing<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:30.180> don't<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.480> such<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> knob

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
but doing this you don't get such a knob

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.619 
but doing this you don't get such a knob
of<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.440> button<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:35.550> back<00:02:35.700> which<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
of a button on the back which is what I

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.449 
of a button on the back which is what I
prefer<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:38.310> maybe<00:02:38.489> just<00:02:38.580> me<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:40.280> oops<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
prefer it's maybe just me but oops I

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:50.570 
prefer it's maybe just me but oops I
forgot<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.000> let<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.420> one<00:02:42.540> out<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> little<00:02:42.930> bit

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.780 

then<00:02:51.650> you're<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.740> gonna<00:02:52.860> wrap<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.370> regular

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
then you're just gonna wrap it regular

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
then you're just gonna wrap it regular

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
less hair like this I can arrange it

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.640 
less hair like this I can arrange it
easier<00:03:10.590> how<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.860> want<00:03:11.480> versus<00:03:12.480> when<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:12.690> just

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650

easier how I want versus when it's just
that<00:03:13.800> big<00:03:14.070> thick<00:03:14.400> braid<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:15.150> can't<00:03:15.600> control<00:03:15.900> it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
that big thick braid I can't control it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.680 
that big thick braid I can't control it
as<00:03:16.290> much<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.800> I'd<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.360> stick<00:03:18.660> a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
as much as I'd like so I will stick a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.190 
as much as I'd like so I will stick a
bobby<00:03:18.930> pin<00:03:19.080> down<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:19.950> lower<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:21.720> begin<00:03:22.020> with

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
bobby pin down here lower to begin with

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.640 
bobby pin down here lower to begin with
so<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.740> sort<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.100> incurred<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
so it's just sort of incurred then I

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.090 
so it's just sort of incurred then I
will<00:03:25.800> pull<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:28.170> make<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.890> bit

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
will pull this and make it a little bit

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.040 
will pull this and make it a little bit
thicker<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.250> then<00:03:32.550> I'm<00:03:32.730> gonna<00:03:32.850> wrap<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.209> up

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
thicker but then I'm gonna wrap it up

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.550 
thicker but then I'm gonna wrap it up
around<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> other<00:03:34.650> direction<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:35.370> this

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
around the other direction like this

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.150 
around the other direction like this
okay<00:03:37.590> hopefully<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:40.160> then

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
okay hopefully you can see that and then

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.870 
okay hopefully you can see that and then
I'm<00:03:41.250> gonna<00:03:41.400> tuck<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.940> end<00:03:43.760> underneath<00:03:44.760> in

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
I'm gonna tuck this end underneath in

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:52.100 
I'm gonna tuck this end underneath in

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
hair so you're getting a bit wider of a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.930 
hair so you're getting a bit wider of a
bun<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:52.770> doesn't<00:03:53.070> protrude<00:03:53.490> off<00:03:53.760> the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.390 
pins in there and then I can hide those
ends<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.140> once<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.950> get<00:04:02.100> it
