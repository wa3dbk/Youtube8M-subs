I've not benched over 275 even but it
feels<00:01:13.979> great<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.340> move<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.820> grip<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> little

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
bit and now feel so much better and I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.999 
bit and now feel so much better and I
think<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> narrow<00:01:18.869> narrow<00:01:19.439> grip<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:19.830> though

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
think the narrow narrow grip work though

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
think the narrow narrow grip work though
