just went a flat and then folded the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
just went a flat and then folded the
flat<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.299> half<00:01:17.180> seamed<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> together<00:01:18.830> on<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

flat in half seamed it together on the
inside<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.979> then<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.400> good<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.759> making

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

inside and then I'm not good at making
buttonholes<00:01:24.600> yet<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> did<00:01:25.920> was<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
buttonholes yet so what I did was when I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.749 
buttonholes yet so what I did was when I
got<00:01:26.729> done<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.180> flap<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.159> part<00:01:29.520> here

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
got done with the flap so this part here

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.460 
got done with the flap so this part here
is<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.119> flap<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.320> by

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
is the flap you can do that by

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.510 
is the flap you can do that by
decreasing<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:33.020> binding<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:35.220> front

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
decreasing your binding off the front

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.670 
decreasing your binding off the front
and<00:01:35.640> back<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:35.909> leaving<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> middle<00:01:37.020> open<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.609 
and back and leaving the middle open you
know<00:01:37.770> leaving<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> middle<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:40.110> since

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
know leaving the middle going but since

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490 
know leaving the middle going but since
I<00:01:40.770> couldn't<00:01:41.070> figure<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.470> make<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
I couldn't figure out how to make a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.240 
I couldn't figure out how to make a
buttonhole<00:01:44.270> what<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> did<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.619> piece

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250

here is actually like I bind I casted on
about<00:01:55.229> 20<00:01:55.920> stitches<00:01:57.170> then<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> did<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:59.040> row<00:01:59.399> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
about 20 stitches then I did a row of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
about 20 stitches then I did a row of
purl<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.320> row<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:02.040> knit<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.140> then<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.170> binded

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
purl and a row of knit and then I binded

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.510 
purl and a row of knit and then I binded
it<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.630> got<00:02:07.369> you<00:02:08.369> know

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it off in it so it's got you know

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
it off in it so it's got you know
something<00:02:08.940> about<00:02:09.000> three<00:02:09.239> stitches<00:02:09.840> well<00:02:10.200> then

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
something about three stitches well then

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.000 
something about three stitches well then
what<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.560> did<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.129> made<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:12.690> into<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
what I did was I made it into like a you

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.630 
what I did was I made it into like a you
sheep<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:15.379> knitted<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
sheep and knitted that on to the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.759 
sheep and knitted that on to the
original<00:02:18.180> band<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.900> that's<00:02:22.049> why<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> did<00:02:22.530> for

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
original band so that's why I did for

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.470 
original band so that's why I did for
that<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.579> it<00:02:23.670> would<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:23.849> come<00:02:24.269> right

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that so that it would just come right

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.640 
that so that it would just come right
over<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.870> button<00:02:25.590> right<00:02:25.799> up<00:02:25.980> there<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:32.459> go

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
over and button right up there you go

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.580 
over and button right up there you go
so<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:34.920> my<00:02:35.129> neat<00:02:35.400> little<00:02:36.110> cell<00:02:37.110> phone<00:02:37.349> case

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so that's my neat little cell phone case

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.550 
so that's my neat little cell phone case
and<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:39.120> would<00:02:39.299> think<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.780> know<00:02:39.810> any<00:02:40.109> pretty

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
and I would think you know any pretty

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.069 
and I would think you know any pretty
much<00:02:40.739> any<00:02:40.950> basic<00:02:41.459> cell<00:02:41.700> phone<00:02:41.970> would<00:02:42.239> fit<00:02:42.930> in

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
much any basic cell phone would fit in

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.940 
much any basic cell phone would fit in

there and this is some I casted on about
16<00:02:50.989> stitches<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.510> kept

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
16 stitches and then I just kept

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.190 
16 stitches and then I just kept
measuring<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.549> against<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:57.109> against<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
measuring it against the against the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
cell phone until I knew I had enough to

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.470 
cell phone until I knew I had enough to
fold<00:03:00.510> over<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.590> would<00:03:01.879> fit<00:03:02.879> so<00:03:03.239> that's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
fold over so that it would fit so that's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.739
