think and now the juggernauts man that

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.559

could although rebirth is going to buy
so<00:03:17.230> many<00:03:17.319> extra<00:03:17.590> turns<00:03:17.770> against<00:03:18.100> drug<00:03:18.220> or<00:03:18.340> not

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.580 

yeah<00:03:23.700> cool

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.960 

i<00:03:30.890> think<00:03:31.890> i'm<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.220> start<00:03:32.370> bashing<00:03:34.970> yeah

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.150 
i think i'm going to start bashing yeah
i'm<00:03:36.900> probably<00:03:37.110> not<00:03:37.230> helping<00:03:37.530> my<00:03:37.739> computer

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
i'm probably not helping my computer

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.860 
i'm probably not helping my computer

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
case keeps acting up is I don't know out

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.550 
case keeps acting up is I don't know out
of<00:03:43.879> sync<00:03:44.879> or<00:03:45.030> something<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:45.989> solution<00:03:46.410> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
of sync or something and my solution to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.979 
of sync or something and my solution to
it<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.220> hit<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.849> which<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.510> probably<00:03:48.720> not

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
it is to hit it which is probably not

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.199 
it is to hit it which is probably not
good<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.410> health<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.799> computer<00:03:50.310> but<00:03:51.030> I

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
good for the health of my computer but I

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.630 
good for the health of my computer but I
