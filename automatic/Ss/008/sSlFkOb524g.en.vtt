than<00:02:34.170> most<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.800> them<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.070> they<00:02:35.220> usually<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
than most of them are they usually a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
than most of them are they usually a
little<00:02:35.730> deeper<00:02:36.150> than<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.660> all

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
little deeper than this but all

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.020 
little deeper than this but all
performing<00:02:37.980> well<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.580> number<00:02:38.730> one

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
performing well so this is number one

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.120 
performing well so this is number one
one<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> first<00:02:40.440> sets<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.769> ever<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
throw myself but these guys mesh so I'll

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.259 
throw myself but these guys mesh so I'll

well so overall a nice custom head

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.740 
well so overall a nice custom head
probably<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.889> flashiest<00:05:32.340> head<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.450> them<00:05:33.599> all

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
probably the flashiest head of them all

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
probably the flashiest head of them all
but<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.050> subdued<00:05:34.680> pocket<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.250> keep<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.550> nice<00:05:35.700> and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.600 
but a subdued pocket to keep it nice and
basic<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:36.479> I<00:05:37.080> think<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:38.010> new<00:05:38.160> weapons<00:05:38.520> of

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
basic so I think the new weapons of

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.800 
basic so I think the new weapons of
choice<00:05:38.639> are<00:05:38.940> even<00:05:39.090> better<00:05:39.180> than<00:05:39.330> all<00:05:39.599> these

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
choice are even better than all these

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.690 
choice are even better than all these
