00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.360 
which of course like always it'd be nice
to<00:02:28.239> get<00:02:28.360> something<00:02:28.599> new<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.950> know<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
to get something new but you know it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.550 
to get something new but you know it
does<00:02:30.579> have<00:02:30.879> about<00:02:31.060> 40<00:02:31.599> minutes<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:31.959> behind<00:02:32.439> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
does have about 40 minutes so behind the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.500 
does have about 40 minutes so behind the
scenes<00:02:32.829> stuff<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.909> there's<00:02:34.120> one<00:02:34.299> that's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
scenes stuff I think there's one that's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.839 
scenes stuff I think there's one that's
20<00:02:34.930> minutes<00:02:35.290> hangers<00:02:36.189> another<00:02:36.459> that's<00:02:36.670> about

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
20 minutes hangers another that's about

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.289 
20 minutes hangers another that's about
15<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:37.930> that's<00:02:38.079> about<00:02:38.319> three<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.609> you

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
15 and one that's about three so you

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.170 
15 and one that's about three so you
know<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:40.989> enough<00:02:41.530> features<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
know you do get enough features like I

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.610 
know you do get enough features like I
said<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.349> would<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.769> nice<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.280> more

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
said but it would be nice to have more

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.890 
said but it would be nice to have more
audio<00:02:47.620> quality<00:02:47.889> sounds<00:02:48.459> really<00:02:48.700> good<00:02:48.909> sounds

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
audio quality sounds really good sounds

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.670 
audio quality sounds really good sounds
great

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
great

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.740 
great
real<00:02:51.010> solid<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.659> video<00:02:52.930> quality<00:02:54.569> if<00:02:55.569> I

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
real solid and the video quality if I

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.819 
real solid and the video quality if I
was<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.079> rank<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.609> blu-ray<00:02:57.609> disc<00:02:58.500> I'd<00:02:59.500> have

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
was to rank this blu-ray disc I'd have

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.199 
was to rank this blu-ray disc I'd have
to<00:03:00.010> say<00:03:00.189> that<00:03:00.220> there's<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.639> noticeable

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
to say that there's a noticeable

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.580 
to say that there's a noticeable
difference<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:03.430> know<00:03:03.750> there<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:04.900> films<00:03:05.470> that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
difference you know there are films that

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.629 
difference you know there are films that
have<00:03:05.950> had<00:03:06.269> better<00:03:07.269> ratings<00:03:07.900> which<00:03:08.739> have<00:03:09.400> had

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
have had better ratings which have had

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.879 
have had better ratings which have had
less<00:03:09.970> difference<00:03:10.540> between<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.319> blue<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
less difference between the blue and the

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:17.189 
less difference between the blue and the
DVD<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.799> as<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.939> said<00:03:16.150> before<00:03:16.299> there<00:03:16.780> are<00:03:16.810> times

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:17.199 
DVD so as I said before there are times

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.039 
DVD so as I said before there are times
where<00:03:18.120> there<00:03:19.120> are<00:03:19.209> times<00:03:19.480> where<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.690> seriously

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
where there are times where I seriously

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.930 
where there are times where I seriously
think<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.560> they<00:03:20.769> haven't<00:03:20.980> really<00:03:21.459> looked<00:03:21.760> at

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
think that they haven't really looked at

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.229 
think that they haven't really looked at
the<00:03:22.030> DVD<00:03:22.449> I<00:03:22.769> mean<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:24.370> know<00:03:24.519> this<00:03:24.910> isn't<00:03:25.180> a

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
the DVD I mean you know this isn't a

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.210 
the DVD I mean you know this isn't a
perfect<00:03:25.629> transfer<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.349> does<00:03:26.620> have<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.919> some

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
perfect transfer it does have it some

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.149 
perfect transfer it does have it some
applause<00:03:27.760> sometimes<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:29.109> is<00:03:29.230> can't<00:03:29.829> be<00:03:30.129> a

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
applause sometimes it is can't be a

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.670 
applause sometimes it is can't be a
little<00:03:30.519> soft<00:03:30.790> sometimes<00:03:31.419> it<00:03:31.690> can<00:03:32.169> have<00:03:32.319> film

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
little soft sometimes it can have film

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.399 
little soft sometimes it can have film
grain<00:03:33.040> which<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.150> natural<00:03:34.599> so<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.840> really<00:03:35.230> can't

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
grain which is natural so I really can't

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.369 
grain which is natural so I really can't
count<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:35.949> as<00:03:36.069> an<00:03:36.190> issue<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:38.260> know

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
count that as an issue you know

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.930 
count that as an issue you know
sometimes<00:03:38.799> it's<00:03:39.010> got<00:03:39.129> more<00:03:39.340> detail<00:03:39.730> than

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
sometimes it's got more detail than

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.349 
sometimes it's got more detail than
others<00:03:40.209> it's<00:03:40.870> not<00:03:41.109> perfect<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.430> it's

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
others it's not perfect but it's

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.960 
others it's not perfect but it's
definitely<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:44.379> surprised<00:03:45.099> me<00:03:45.310> especially

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
definitely it surprised me especially

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.319 
definitely it surprised me especially
since<00:03:46.419> I<00:03:46.810> wasn't<00:03:47.169> I<00:03:47.680> wasn't<00:03:48.329> expecting

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
since I wasn't I wasn't expecting

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.849 
since I wasn't I wasn't expecting
anything<00:03:50.489> such<00:03:51.489> as<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:53.290> beginning<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
anything such as the beginning of the

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.890 
anything such as the beginning of the
film<00:03:54.099> when<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:54.579> see<00:03:54.879> Robin<00:03:55.299> Williams<00:03:55.690> as<00:03:55.870> a
