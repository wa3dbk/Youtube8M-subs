00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
problem if it gets really bad maybe the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.569 
problem if it gets really bad maybe the
police<00:03:19.470> will<00:03:19.590> shut<00:03:19.890> down<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.220> whole<00:03:20.310> place

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
and that's really what the operating

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.979 
and that's really what the operating
system<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.950> doing<00:03:23.129> an<00:03:24.120> iphone<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.780> keeps
