it<00:01:19.110> still<00:01:19.650> doesn't<00:01:19.979> feel<00:01:20.100> quite<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.670> fast

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it still doesn't feel quite that fast

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
it still doesn't feel quite that fast
but<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.680> does<00:01:22.890> make<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> huge<00:01:23.159> difference

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
but it it does make a huge difference

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399

PSD<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> complete<00:01:38.250> them<00:01:38.400> runs<00:01:38.640> which

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
PSD actually I complete them runs which

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.580 
PSD actually I complete them runs which
is<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.479> useful<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> still<00:01:40.259> doesn't<00:01:40.380> feel

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
is very useful but it still doesn't feel

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.109 
is very useful but it still doesn't feel
quite<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.009> 84<00:01:41.430> which<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.970> slightly

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
quite like 84 which is slightly

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.210 
quite like 84 which is slightly
disappointing<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> dribble<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
disappointing and I on the dribble and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.770 
disappointing and I on the dribble and
although<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:44.820> being<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> seven<00:01:45.390> increase

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
although there's being a seven increase

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
although there's being a seven increase
on<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.110> dribblin<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.920> better<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
on this dribblin is a lot better the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
on this dribblin is a lot better the
assume<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> season<00:01:48.600> RVP<00:01:49.020> does<00:01:49.259> not<00:01:49.409> feel<00:01:49.680> like

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
assume the season RVP does not feel like

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
assume the season RVP does not feel like
a<00:01:50.070> 91<00:01:50.729> dribble<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.210> player<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.750> make<00:01:51.930> sense

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a 91 dribble and player that make sense

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
a 91 dribble and player that make sense
so<00:01:52.380> slightly<00:01:53.009> disappointed<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> know

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
so slightly disappointed but you know

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
so slightly disappointed but you know
the<00:01:54.299> 19<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> season<00:01:54.930> our<00:01:54.990> behavior<00:01:55.259> still

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the 19 the season our behavior still

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
the 19 the season our behavior still
pretty<00:01:55.649> good<00:01:55.770> dribbler<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> did<00:01:56.640> Sabbath

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pretty good dribbler so I did Sabbath

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.300 
pretty good dribbler so I did Sabbath
and<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.630> equals<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.079> very<00:01:58.649> good<00:01:58.829> dribbler<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and it equals a very good dribbler and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.730 
and it equals a very good dribbler and
certainly<00:02:00.060> good<00:02:00.299> enough<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> ya<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.619> what

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
certainly good enough to ya to do what

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.530 
certainly good enough to ya to do what
you<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.159> an<00:02:02.729> eye<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.210> shouldn't

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
you need to do an eye on this shouldn't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.609 
you need to do an eye on this shouldn't
and<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> reason<00:02:04.140> you'd<00:02:04.409> buy<00:02:04.560> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and this is the reason you'd buy this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.109 
and this is the reason you'd buy this
card<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:04.979> my<00:02:05.040> opinion<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.490> even<00:02:05.790> because<00:02:05.909> it's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
card in my opinion not even because it's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.789 
card in my opinion not even because it's
our<00:02:06.270> vp<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.719> peers<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
our vp with peers because of the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.949 
our vp with peers because of the
shouldn't<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> my<00:02:08.459> opinion<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.360> card<00:02:09.720> has

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
shouldn't in my opinion this card has

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.000 
shouldn't in my opinion this card has
the<00:02:10.140> best<00:02:10.319> shot<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.310> game

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the best shot in the game

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.699 
the best shot in the game
it<00:02:12.099> is<00:02:12.489> unbelievably<00:02:13.360> good<00:02:13.569> now<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.290> north<00:02:14.530> in

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
it is unbelievably good now the north in

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.229 
it is unbelievably good now the north in
the<00:02:14.739> season<00:02:15.129> already<00:02:15.310> has<00:02:15.700> one<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.120> best

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
the season already has one of the best

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.030 
the season already has one of the best
shots<00:02:16.450> in<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.689> game<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.930> my<00:02:17.019> opinion<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.709> this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
shots in the game in my opinion and this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.830 
shots in the game in my opinion and this
just<00:02:18.250> makes<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.519> even<00:02:18.670> more<00:02:18.849> bad<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.390> odd<00:02:19.569> it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
just makes it even more bad as odd it's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.119 
just makes it even more bad as odd it's
absolutely<00:02:19.989> brilliant<00:02:20.409> it's<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:20.860> clinical

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
absolutely brilliant it's so clinical

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.850 
absolutely brilliant it's so clinical

where I take a shot from it seems to be

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.660 
where I take a shot from it seems to be
on<00:02:25.780> target<00:02:26.049> he<00:02:26.500> has<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.709> lovely<00:02:27.040> curve<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.579> the

shot if you're gonna from an angle it

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.990 
shot if you're gonna from an angle it
just<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.620> always<00:02:30.069> seems<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.519> go<00:02:30.730> where<00:02:30.879> you

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
just it always seems to go where you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
just it always seems to go where you
wanted<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.299> go<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.500> only<00:02:32.620> time<00:02:32.769> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
wanted to go and the only time it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.770 
wanted to go and the only time it
doesn't<00:02:33.069> go<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.700> if<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.239> keeper<00:02:34.390> makes<00:02:34.659> a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
doesn't go in is if the keeper makes a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.539 
doesn't go in is if the keeper makes a
good<00:02:34.900> see<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.230> but<00:02:35.860> yeah<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.069> mean<00:02:36.159> there's<00:02:36.310> not

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
good see if but yeah I mean there's not

good see if but yeah I mean there's not
really<00:02:36.700> much<00:02:36.879> more<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.120> can<00:02:37.209> say<00:02:37.360> about<00:02:37.629> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
really much more I can say about the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.180 
really much more I can say about the

matters and I haven't really experienced

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.069 
matters and I haven't really experienced
that<00:03:00.370> much<00:03:00.579> either<00:03:00.819> his<00:03:01.329> head<00:03:01.629> and<00:03:01.780> has<00:03:01.900> been

that much either his head and has been

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
upgraded from 60th 277 and that's quite

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.399 
upgraded from 60th 277 and that's quite
good<00:03:04.269> actually<00:03:04.480> because<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.959> go<00:03:05.049> shouldn't<00:03:05.319> be

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
good actually because it go shouldn't be

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.500 
good actually because it go shouldn't be
in<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.709> pretty<00:03:05.920> bad<00:03:06.190> at<00:03:06.400> headed<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.090> pretty
