00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
is more tensed like in this direction

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.430 
is more tensed like in this direction
than<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.140> one<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:09.460> really<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.899> this<00:02:11.290> is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
than this one is so really and this is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.290 
than this one is so really and this is
purely<00:02:11.740> cosmetic<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:12.670> point<00:02:12.940> really<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
purely cosmetic at this point really the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.220 
purely cosmetic at this point really the
