that like xboxes control ass tickle
which<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.040> bad<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.850> table

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210

hands<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.740> naturally<00:01:50.310> preference<00:01:50.820> but

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hands but that naturally preference but

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.260 
hands but that naturally preference but
I<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> general<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.310> ps3<00:01:53.909> controls

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.590 
I think in general the ps3 controls
bevel<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.740> ask<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.310> people<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.420> can

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
bevel if you ask more people if they can

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.530 
bevel if you ask more people if they can
