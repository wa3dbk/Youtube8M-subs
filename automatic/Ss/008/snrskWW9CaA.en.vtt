modern warfare 2 there's also a weapon

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
modern warfare 2 there's also a weapon
that<00:00:40.200> looks<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.520> OGG<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.420> also<00:00:43.170> like

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that looks to be the OGG and also like

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.930 
that looks to be the OGG and also like
one<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> snipers<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.309> world<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.730> war

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
one of the snipers from world at war

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.209 
one of the snipers from world at war
which<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.570> pretty<00:00:45.750> cool<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
which is pretty cool I think and this is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
which is pretty cool I think and this is
obviously<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.700> first<00:00:48.000> person<00:00:48.180> shooter<00:00:48.420> mod<00:00:48.809> as

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
obviously a first person shooter mod as

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
obviously a first person shooter mod as
you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.620> seems<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:51.239> also

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you can see it seems like there's also

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.470 
you can see it seems like there's also
some<00:00:52.079> sort<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.980> explosive<00:00:53.610> rounds<00:00:54.270> mod

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
some sort of a like explosive rounds mod

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
some sort of a like explosive rounds mod
as<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> looks<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> rounds

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
as well so it looks like that the rounds

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.110 
as well so it looks like that the rounds
have<00:00:56.879> explosive<00:00:57.539> ends<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:59.030> this<00:01:00.030> is
