very discouraged why did he even bother

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679 
very discouraged why did he even bother
to<00:00:20.400> send<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> troops<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> surge

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
which he took a long time making a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
which he took a long time making a
decision<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.119> only<00:00:24.840> gave<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> fraction<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
decision and only gave a fraction of

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.769 
decision and only gave a fraction of
them<00:00:25.830> why<00:00:25.980> did<00:00:26.130> he<00:00:26.250> even<00:00:26.310> bother<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
them why did he even bother if if this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.660 
them why did he even bother if if this
was<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> plan<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.680> doesn't<00:00:29.010> seem<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.550> make

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
was the plan it doesn't seem to make

was the plan it doesn't seem to make
sense<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.119> me<00:00:30.240> why<00:00:30.750> isn't<00:00:31.050> he<00:00:31.109> listening<00:00:31.260> in

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
sense to me why isn't he listening in

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040 
sense to me why isn't he listening in
the<00:00:31.590> General<00:00:31.920> Petraeus<00:00:32.450> well<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the General Petraeus well I think one of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
the General Petraeus well I think one of
the<00:00:34.200> things<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.829> saw<00:00:35.070> tonight<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the things that you saw tonight was a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
the things that you saw tonight was a
highly<00:00:36.180> politicized<00:00:36.960> mission<00:00:37.800> accomplished

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
highly politicized mission accomplished

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.729 
highly politicized mission accomplished
speech<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.180> absent<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> aircraft

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

carrier<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> banner<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
carrier in the banner and I think that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
carrier in the banner and I think that
you<00:00:42.899> saw<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> facade<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.520> president<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you saw the facade of a president that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
you saw the facade of a president that
wanted<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.110> involved<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> combat

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
wanted to get involved in the combat

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
wanted to get involved in the combat
theater<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.969> operations<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.600> Afghanistan<00:00:49.320> but

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
theater of operations in Afghanistan but

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
theater of operations in Afghanistan but
really<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.730> his<00:00:50.910> comfort<00:00:51.360> zone<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
really that was not his comfort zone I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.270 
really that was not his comfort zone I
think<00:00:52.289> when<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.949> speech<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
think when you look at this speech the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
think when you look at this speech the
money<00:00:53.670> line<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> president<00:00:54.750> used<00:00:54.930> was

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
money line that the president used was

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
money line that the president used was
that<00:00:55.379> America<00:00:55.920> we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> start

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that America we're going to start

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
that America we're going to start
nation-building<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.899> home<00:00:58.140> which<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.859> exactly

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
nation-building at home which is exactly

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
nation-building at home which is exactly
what<00:00:59.699> he'd<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.480> his<00:01:00.690> focus<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.320> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
what he'd like to have his focus on so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.260 
what he'd like to have his focus on so
this<00:01:02.070> ended<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.460> being<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> campaign

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
this ended up being more of a campaign

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
this ended up being more of a campaign
speech<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.729> strategy<00:01:05.729> speech<00:01:06.000> for

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

Senator McCain I don't think that Libya

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.680 
Senator McCain I don't think that Libya
is<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.680> operation<00:04:56.550> that<00:04:56.820> we<00:04:56.940> should<00:04:57.120> be<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.450> we

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
is a operation that we should be in we

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.310 
is a operation that we should be in we
have<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:57.930> very<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.940> objectives<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:01.080> thing

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
have a very and objectives and the thing

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200 
have a very and objectives and the thing
is<00:05:01.530> that<00:05:01.560> those<00:05:02.490> people<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:02.910> are

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
is that those people that are

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.240 
is that those people that are
participating<00:05:03.540> in<00:05:03.930> operation<00:05:04.590> are<00:05:04.710> receiving

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
participating in operation are receiving

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.340 
participating in operation are receiving
m<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.640> danger<00:05:06.060> pay<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:06.750> think<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.110> there

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
m and a danger pay so I think that there

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.900 
m and a danger pay so I think that there
are<00:05:07.380> hostilities<00:05:08.160> over<00:05:08.460> there<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:08.760> if<00:05:08.820> you're

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
are hostilities over there and if you're

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.790 
are hostilities over there and if you're
having<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.210> bob<00:05:09.419> dropped<00:05:09.780> on<00:05:09.990> your<00:05:10.140> head<00:05:10.320> that

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
having a bob dropped on your head that

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.650 
having a bob dropped on your head that
is<00:05:10.919> definitely<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.370> hostile<00:05:11.790> action<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
is definitely a hostile action the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.240 
is definitely a hostile action the
actions<00:05:13.140> in<00:05:13.260> Libya<00:05:13.410> do<00:05:13.740> not<00:05:13.919> meet<00:05:14.130> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
actions in Libya do not meet the
