00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 string3 the television more also more 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 that never because the dream is over for 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.630
 Mexico we had that illusion all 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.240
 Mexicans of the famous fifth game 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.120
 that does not arrive and that definitely does not 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 came eighth of finals up there 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.800
 they arrived with holland the tricolor fell 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 by two goals to 1 in the stadium castelao 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.550
 of strength those directed by Miguel 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 Herrera were not able and really what 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.660
 we say to maintain that advantage that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.340
 they had because they started winning the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 second half to a goal for 0 with a goal 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.320
 from giovanni dos saints and there obviously 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.020
 all Mexicans had the illusion 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 that the arbitration failed in some 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 moments against mexico but 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 also in favor because in the first 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 time in a very clear penalty that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.020
 they could have marked mexico and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.360
 they forgave and then obviously the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 referee if he marks a penalty but there is a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.530
 thing there is one important thing is the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.739
 that mark mexico that was not 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 and that robben pulls in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.980
 with the leg and that's what the referee sees 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.719
 I believe that in the area no player 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.370
 must enter with the leg as 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.840
 getting into the one player because if the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.670
 referee sees from afar you can mark a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.890
 criminal you have to take care every time 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.130
 when you are inside the area already so that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.770
 we say more effectively if there were things 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 doubtful but mexico lost delivered the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.399
 ball in the second part after the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 goal of giovanni dos saints and loses 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.020
 loses with hollanda returns to his house 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.299
 I believe that this day will be already 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 planning the return for mexico and for 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.780
 soon the band advances to quarters of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.049
 final there is no fifth match for 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.490
 mexico does not exist until here we come and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.000
 it's over football they still started the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.399
 world 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.929
 let's say they came against the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.830
 forecasts or it went too much what 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.539
 They succeeded but ultimately 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.369
 they repeated the story repeats the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.810
 history and we can not create the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 conformism not because it is true that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.420
 Mexico we arrive arrives with few dreams 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.610
 everyone plays their first 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.319
 matches but yesterday they did not manage 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 maintain that advantage and mexico is 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.310
 unfortunately outside our channel 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.140
 from youtube so you're always 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.259

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.240
