00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.030
 Your friend can not enter the mission. 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.499
 You'll get it and put the car in the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.810
 your garage 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.869

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.200
 garage and you will pick it up when you have 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.170

 when my friend is already in the car 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.829
 My friend is in the car and I 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.280

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.719

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.899

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.330
 now he's going to have to get out of the car and I 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.429

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.620

 Last car I've done this several times. 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.360
 You look at my garage the way it used to be. 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.879
 I advise you to do in the garage that 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.799
 more empty of you in case here 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.690
 had no car in the garage and 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.230
 can do here the way I do 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.920
 I took every car from here, it's going to cost me 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.159
 85 thousand 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.090
 now it's just you to pick it up and sell the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:56.430
 every 45 minutes in the light of this crowd then 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.670
