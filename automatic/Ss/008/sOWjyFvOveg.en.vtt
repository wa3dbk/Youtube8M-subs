they're<00:02:30.220> too<00:02:30.489> big<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:31.030> me<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:31.750> that's<00:02:31.870> okay<00:02:32.350> I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
they're too big for me but that's okay I

usually wear very thick wool socks the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.650 
usually wear very thick wool socks the
only<00:02:35.440> reason<00:02:35.739> they're<00:02:35.950> too<00:02:36.790> big<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.269> think<00:02:37.330> I

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
only reason they're too big is I think I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.289 
only reason they're too big is I think I
gave<00:02:37.900> them<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.200> wrong<00:02:38.350> size<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.180> my

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
gave them the wrong size but so it's my

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.530 
gave them the wrong size but so it's my
fault<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:43.319> didn't<00:02:44.319> think<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:45.330> American<00:02:46.330> size

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
fault I didn't think that American size

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.870 
fault I didn't think that American size
differed<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.319> much<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.860> guess<00:02:48.340> they<00:02:48.519> do

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
differed that much but I guess they do

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.910 
differed that much but I guess they do
they're<00:02:49.810> also<00:02:50.049> these<00:02:50.910> beautiful<00:02:52.590> claws<00:02:53.590> on

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
they're also these beautiful claws on

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.940 
they're also these beautiful claws on
the<00:02:54.220> feet<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:57.190> flexes<00:02:57.819> when<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.420> walk

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the feet and it flexes when you walk

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.979 
the feet and it flexes when you walk

on<00:03:10.660> your<00:03:10.870> toe<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.590> pen<00:03:11.829> this<00:03:12.130> vein<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.700> way

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
on your toe the pen this vein that way

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.370 
on your toe the pen this vein that way
so<00:03:13.780> walking<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:15.069> really<00:03:15.370> real<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.380> they're

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
so walking is really real and they're

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.140 
so walking is really real and they're
just<00:03:17.620> put<00:03:17.829> together<00:03:18.010> quite<00:03:18.400> nicely<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.940> claws

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
just put together quite nicely the claws

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.900 
just put together quite nicely the claws
don't<00:03:19.480> wiggle<00:03:19.720> around<00:03:19.989> they're<00:03:20.530> quite<00:03:21.459> stuck

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
don't wiggle around they're quite stuck

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.849 
don't wiggle around they're quite stuck
on<00:03:22.120> there<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:22.989> don't<00:03:23.109> ever<00:03:23.319> have<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.829> worry

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
on there so I don't ever have to worry

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.630 
on there so I don't ever have to worry
about<00:03:24.220> breaking<00:03:24.819> them<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.150> they're<00:03:26.019> not<00:03:26.200> too

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
about breaking them and they're not too

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.330 
about breaking them and they're not too
hard<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.850> manage<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:29.260> really<00:03:29.709> big<00:03:29.889> versus

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
hard to manage like really big versus

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.720 
hard to manage like really big versus
paws<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.840> tail<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.620> also<00:03:33.120> airbrushed<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:35.730> make

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
paws the tail is also airbrushed to make

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.720 
paws the tail is also airbrushed to make
it<00:03:36.910> look<00:03:37.120> more<00:03:37.299> real<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> belt<00:03:38.109> loops<00:03:38.730> are

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it look more real and the belt loops are

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.410 
it look more real and the belt loops are
perfect<00:03:40.389> I<00:03:40.690> know<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.709> sometimes<00:03:42.549> belt<00:03:43.180> loops

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
perfect I know that sometimes belt loops

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.240 
perfect I know that sometimes belt loops
can<00:03:43.660> be<00:03:43.720> too<00:03:43.989> big<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.380> then<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.739> see<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
can be too big and then you can see the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.699 
can be too big and then you can see the
part<00:03:45.489> at<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.760> base<00:03:45.940> but<00:03:46.350> they're<00:03:47.350> just

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
part at the base but they're just

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.910 
part at the base but they're just
perfect<00:03:48.639> and<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.900> stuffed<00:03:53.290> quite<00:03:53.620> nicely

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
perfect and it's stuffed quite nicely

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.460 
perfect and it's stuffed quite nicely
but<00:03:54.190> not<00:03:54.400> too<00:03:54.609> much<00:03:54.819> so<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.470> really

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
but not too much so it's just really

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.140 
but not too much so it's just really
really<00:03:56.739> nice<00:03:57.510> and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
really nice and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.210 
really nice and

about that too

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.250 
about that too
but<00:04:39.000> for<00:04:39.210> now<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.360> really<00:04:39.750> don't<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:39.960> anything

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
but for now I really don't have anything

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.760 
but for now I really don't have anything
to<00:04:40.530> show<00:04:40.740> off<00:04:40.970> other<00:04:41.970> than<00:04:42.300> her<00:04:42.990> beautiful

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
to show off other than her beautiful

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.480 
to show off other than her beautiful
features

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
features

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.189 
features
so<00:04:45.020> her<00:04:46.020> ears<00:04:46.500> are<00:04:47.310> kind<00:04:47.729> of<00:04:47.940> Wiggly<00:04:48.389> but<00:04:48.780> not

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
so her ears are kind of Wiggly but not

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.610 
so her ears are kind of Wiggly but not
really<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.449> they<00:04:51.449> don't<00:04:51.660> like<00:04:51.900> flop<00:04:52.260> around

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
really so they don't like flop around

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.469 
really so they don't like flop around
when<00:04:52.919> I<00:04:52.949> move<00:04:53.370> but<00:04:53.789> they<00:04:54.750> can<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:57.180> know<00:04:57.270> her

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
when I move but they can you know her

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.909 
when I move but they can you know her
jaw<00:04:57.690> does<00:04:57.960> open<00:04:58.349> when<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.530> open<00:04:59.009> it<00:04:59.160> and<00:05:00.139> yeah<00:05:02.810> so

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
jaw does open when I open it and yeah so

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.800 
jaw does open when I open it and yeah so
it<00:05:04.919> also<00:05:05.070> has<00:05:05.280> arms<00:05:05.639> leaves<00:05:05.880> but<00:05:06.210> there's

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
it also has arms leaves but there's

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
it also has arms leaves but there's
pretty<00:05:07.050> much<00:05:07.110> just<00:05:07.530> fabric<00:05:08.240> so<00:05:09.240> I<00:05:09.830> didn't

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
pretty much just fabric so I didn't

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.529 
pretty much just fabric so I didn't
think<00:05:11.039> it'd<00:05:11.250> be<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.580> interesting<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.270> put<00:05:12.389> on

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
think it'd be that interesting to put on

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.950 
think it'd be that interesting to put on
the<00:05:12.660> video<00:05:13.220> if<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:14.490> have<00:05:14.699> any<00:05:14.910> questions<00:05:15.570> and
