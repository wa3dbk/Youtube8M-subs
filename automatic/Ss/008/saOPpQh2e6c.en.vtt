00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.870
 Dr 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.599
 to enjoy the untouched nature 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.599
 until the evening 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.089
 but not on 22 in January 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.720
 because it was time again 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.230
 Actuant Corp in Rauris scored the world's best for the second consecutive year 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.109
 Telemark 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.870
 to further refine the river 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.830
 the Salzburg family ski area 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.910
 has been making a name for himself in the scene for years 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.860
 In 2010, a World Cup race was already held on the ground floor with great success 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 stage 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.590
 again this year then over 60 participants from 14 countries in Paris 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.030
 represented in the battle for the decisive hundredths of a second 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.240
 in bright sunshine, the participants showed what they had on two boards 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.030
 have it 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.110
 Valcke 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.550
 i like it too we have a nice time we love it here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.790
 the special in the topic is in it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.820
 the 3 techniques of ski jumping cross country and downhill to a webcam from 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.240
 get connected 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.160
 unlike alpine skiing, there is one at the gates of the giant slalom 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.619
 Awe-inspiring ski jump in the middle of the Hofer lead over the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 Racers have to jump 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 At the end of the flow, there is also a 360 ° steep turn on the telemarkers 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 which slow them down to cross-country skiing speed 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 With good momentum from the circles, no one gets through in the last few meters 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 Cross-country skiers which skills are valuable 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.420
 the departure in Rauris is particularly good for the theme 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.160
 because the slope conditions best conditions 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
 for a successful unspectacular race 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.499
 March but get a party that passed 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.850
 previously there were testers evening his numbers for the lessons 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.880
 thinking about the stones 105 are 5 points 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.489
 then that is apparently not always dr sneaky pistons the place as well 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.029
 will be later at Ferrari 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.349
 before the beginning of the 2 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.730
 punctually at 10 o'clock the starting signal for the first round fell 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.979
 will not be skipped sideline is a small time penalty 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.759
 on 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.760
 Naturally 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.360
 had to land in Telemark victory as the goals with the so-called 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.119
 Lunge be passed 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 to cope with no further roads 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.270
 at the Classic 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.960
 the nordic combination par excellence he is planning for skiers 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:10.069
 because in addition to the 360 ​​° steep wall curve in the daring turning maneuvers to see 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.730
 are the jump probably the most spectacular element of the Classic 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:15.269
 competition 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.980
 In the last section of the track is in love with one or the other 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.950
 not always very smooth which sometimes cost a lot of time 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.620
 Protect your judgment is now rotten for the spectator that is her 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:28.510
 spectacular 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
 because if it bothered so it would end like this 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.010
 at long last 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.090
 prevailed at the ladies Amelith demo from Switzerland and among the men of the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.620
 Frenchman Philippe according to clock they took first place at the second this lack 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.779
 Markwort force in Rauris 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.139
 from when trigger fight transfer 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.139
 the two runs were difficult the sea was 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.119
 but he has to be fine 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:57.969
 Rhyn Percent the two Love I did made me super disappointed 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.699
 had and there 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.929
 So just be happy 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:07.509
 that's five times more the two courses were also the colorful spectrum 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.989
 Crime scene was 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.369
 second and third place in the women's team Bayer 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:15.900
 also from Switzerland 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.769
 and the Norwegian critic Knutsen in the men got a recruit kiss 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.550
 Norway and Anton Bopp each from France did not go to the front of St 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.590
 Also this year the World Cup on the cross soil was a great success for all 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.120
 all participants from different nations 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.630
 The British army presented themselves from their best side together 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.800
 with the Rauriser valley organizer was completely satisfied 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.079
 Alex Zülle instead I am extremely satisfied everything went really well 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.839
 And every raid worked hard it's a good race if the participants 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.409
 they radiate and they do 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.300
 We have been here for many years and this is like coming home to feel 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 us as a part of the family we will demand 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.330
 we are already looking forward to the next year 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.849
 because at the cross ground renewed for the best placements is fought 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.180
 instead of
