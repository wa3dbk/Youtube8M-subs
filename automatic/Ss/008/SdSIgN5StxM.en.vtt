00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the adder on GTA 5 online it does spawn

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.340 
the adder on GTA 5 online it does spawn
the<00:00:38.370> same<00:00:38.580> exact<00:00:39.000> spawn<00:00:39.270> location<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> does

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the same exact spawn location as it does

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
the same exact spawn location as it does
on<00:00:40.560> GTA<00:00:40.950> 5<00:00:41.280> story<00:00:41.760> mode<00:00:41.970> so<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.660> come<00:00:42.810> over<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
on GTA 5 story mode so just come over to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810 
on GTA 5 story mode so just come over to
this<00:00:43.260> location<00:00:43.470> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> map<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:44.700> should

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this location on the map and it should

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
this location on the map and it should
spawn<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.540> make<00:00:46.050> sure<00:00:46.080> you<00:00:46.320> guys<00:00:46.440> are

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
spawn right here make sure you guys are

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.470 
spawn right here make sure you guys are
driving<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.370> an<00:00:47.520> adder<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
driving in an adder up and down the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.240 
driving in an adder up and down the
street<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.080> it<00:00:49.230> spawns<00:00:49.560> in<00:00:49.830> much<00:00:50.070> more

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
street so it spawns in much more

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040 
street so it spawns in much more
frequently<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.060> it<00:00:51.240> is<00:00:51.360> pretty<00:00:51.570> rare<00:00:51.840> for

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
frequently because it is pretty rare for

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
frequently because it is pretty rare for
it<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> spawn<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.400> make<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.580> spawn<00:00:53.880> in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it to spawn in so to make a spawn in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
it to spawn in so to make a spawn in
faster<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.960> sure<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.200> guys<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.380> using<00:00:55.710> an

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
faster make sure you guys are using an

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.680 
faster make sure you guys are using an
adder<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.370> drive<00:00:56.610> around<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.090> find<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.420> one

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
adder to drive around to find this one

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.480 
adder to drive around to find this one
or<00:00:57.990> use<00:00:58.200> a<00:00:58.230> friend's<00:00:58.680> adder<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.010> something

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
or use a friend's adder or something

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.760 
or use a friend's adder or something
like<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.270> make<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> spawn<00:01:00.810> so<00:01:01.380> just<00:01:01.590> keep

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
like that to make it spawn so just keep

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.020 
like that to make it spawn so just keep
driving<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.220> and<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> road<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
driving up and down the road and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.579 
driving up and down the road and
eventually<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> should<00:01:03.930> spawn<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> as<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
eventually it should spawn and as you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.440 
eventually it should spawn and as you
guys<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:05.309> adder<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.910> not<00:01:06.060> parked

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
guys can see this adder was not parked

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
guys can see this adder was not parked
here<00:01:06.660> because<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:07.590> character<00:01:07.650> actually<00:01:08.280> did

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here because my character actually did

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580 
here because my character actually did
break<00:01:08.610> open<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.120> window<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.690> go<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
break open the window and go into it so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
break open the window and go into it so
this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.950> online<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.490> fully<00:01:11.700> legit<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this is online it's fully legit and it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350 
this is online it's fully legit and it
did<00:01:13.020> spawn<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.370> after<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.730> guys<00:01:14.910> do<00:01:15.150> have

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
did spawn here so after you guys do have

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
did spawn here so after you guys do have
this<00:01:15.510> adder<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> guys<00:01:16.320> try<00:01:16.650> driving<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this adder if you guys try driving it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.740

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
different session than you host the job

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.920 
different session than you host the job
so<00:01:50.010> have<00:01:50.159> them<00:01:50.280> host<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.670> job<00:01:50.909> once<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> host

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

back in since the car I replaced the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.979 
back in since the car I replaced the
adder<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.610> had<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.849> tracker<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.900> it

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
adder with had a tracker on it and it

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.720 
adder with had a tracker on it and it
was<00:02:40.110> fully<00:02:40.349> insured<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.010> adder<00:02:41.250> will<00:02:41.549> have<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
was fully insured this adder will have a

well<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.519> when<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.700> guys<00:02:44.819> basically<00:02:45.330> did<00:02:45.510> this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
well so when you guys basically did this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.120 
well so when you guys basically did this
glitch<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.080> adder<00:02:46.260> outside<00:02:46.709> was<00:02:46.920> being

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
glitch the adder outside was being

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.589 
glitch the adder outside was being
watched<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.060> friends<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.480> the

watched by one of your friends so the

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.420 
watched by one of your friends so the
adder<00:02:48.750> does<00:02:49.049> not<00:02:49.200> de-spawn<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.280> guys

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
adder does not de-spawn then you guys

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.830 
adder does not de-spawn then you guys
had<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> second<00:02:51.060> friend<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.480> different
