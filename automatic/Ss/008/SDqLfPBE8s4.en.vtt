00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
lost our ability to be good fat burners

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.109 
lost our ability to be good fat burners
and<00:00:27.570> fat<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.859> very<00:00:29.189> important<00:00:29.699> source<00:00:29.910> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and fat is a very important source of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.990 
and fat is a very important source of
fuel<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:31.439> two<00:00:31.710> sources<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> fuel<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.910> we

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
fuel there's two sources of fuel that we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880 
fuel there's two sources of fuel that we
have<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.360> our<00:00:33.480> body<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:33.960> carbohydrates

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
have in our body one is carbohydrates

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
have in our body one is carbohydrates
and<00:00:35.070> sugar<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.910> other<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.239> fat<00:00:36.600> we've

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and sugar and the other is fat we've

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
and sugar and the other is fat we've
been<00:00:37.170> told<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.530> 30<00:00:37.950> years<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.309> fats<00:00:38.790> are

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
been told for 30 years that fats are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
been told for 30 years that fats are
badly<00:00:39.480> low<00:00:39.780> fat<00:00:40.079> diet<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.559> we've<00:00:40.680> been<00:00:40.829> fed<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
badly low fat diet and we've been fed a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
badly low fat diet and we've been fed a
lot<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.030> carbohydrates<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> we've<00:00:43.290> sort<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
lot of carbohydrates and we've sort of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520 
lot of carbohydrates and we've sort of
created<00:00:44.460> an<00:00:44.579> imbalance<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.989> kinds<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
created an imbalance in the kinds of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.160 
created an imbalance in the kinds of
fuel<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.190> we're<00:00:47.640> ingesting<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> therefore

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
fuel that we're ingesting and therefore

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.100 
fuel that we're ingesting and therefore
burning<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.640> say<00:00:50.850> reset<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.780> fat

Western science old molecules of emotion
from<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.880> fat<00:01:24.119> cells<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> actually

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
from your fat cells so we can actually

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
from your fat cells so we can actually
have<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:26.220> clarity<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> awareness<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.330> what

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have more clarity and awareness of what

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.960 
have more clarity and awareness of what
our<00:01:27.780> crazy<00:01:28.200> mind<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.799> doing<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.700> some

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
our crazy mind is doing and make some

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
our crazy mind is doing and make some
changes<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.930> mental<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.770> emotional

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
changes there on a mental and emotional

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.240 
changes there on a mental and emotional
level<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.030> fat<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.439> important

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100 
level so fat is just a very important
source<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.700> fuel<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> doesn't<00:01:36.810> matter

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
source of fuel and it doesn't matter

study<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:55.350> long<00:01:55.590> ago<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.040> showed<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.579> when

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
study not long ago that showed that when

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.770 
study not long ago that showed that when
we<00:01:57.390> don't<00:01:57.810> eat<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.280> only<00:01:59.579> survive<00:02:00.420> we're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
we don't eat we don't only survive we're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.350 
we don't eat we don't only survive we're
not<00:02:00.899> genetically<00:02:01.409> wired<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.250> survive<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:03.210> we

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
not genetically wired to survive when we

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.700 
not genetically wired to survive when we
have<00:02:03.750> famine<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.500> we

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
have famine and we

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
have famine and we
have<00:02:04.890> food<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> few<00:02:05.760> days<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.570> actually

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
have food for a few days we actually

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.270 
have food for a few days we actually
thrive<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:08.459> cells<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.470> nucleus<00:02:11.100> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
thrive the cells the the the nucleus of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.059 
thrive the cells the the the nucleus of
the<00:02:11.430> cells<00:02:11.730> trigger<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> genetic<00:02:13.140> response<00:02:13.350> to

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the cells trigger a genetic response to

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.220 
the cells trigger a genetic response to
that<00:02:14.190> lack<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.580> food<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.480> makes<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.959> cells

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
that lack of food that makes the cells

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.430 
that lack of food that makes the cells
live<00:02:16.650> longer<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.370> produce<00:02:18.120> more<00:02:18.420> energy<00:02:19.020> so

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
live longer and produce more energy so

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.770 
live longer and produce more energy so
that's<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> crazy<00:02:20.370> concept<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.510> when

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that's this is a crazy concept that when

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.440 
that's this is a crazy concept that when
we<00:02:21.989> don't<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.680> food<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.130> don't<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.640> survive

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
we don't have food we don't just survive

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.610 
we don't have food we don't just survive
we<00:02:25.230> thrive<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.970> idea<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.780> being<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.590> good

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
we thrive so the idea of being a good

so you are forcing the body to burn its

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.900 
so you are forcing the body to burn its
own<00:03:02.940> fat<00:03:03.239> that's<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.900> real<00:03:04.290> critical<00:03:04.709> piece<00:03:05.700> of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
own fat that's a real critical piece of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.470 
own fat that's a real critical piece of
the<00:03:06.450> puzzle<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.880> there<00:03:08.880> are<00:03:08.940> other<00:03:09.030> things<00:03:09.299> you

diets well they have been shown to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.150 
diets well they have been shown to
actually<00:03:18.450> increase<00:03:18.720> fat<00:03:19.350> metabolism<00:03:19.560> and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
actually increase fat metabolism and

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.830 
actually increase fat metabolism and
support<00:03:20.579> stable<00:03:20.910> blood<00:03:21.090> sugar<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.510> there<00:03:21.690> are

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
support stable blood sugar so there are

on there the leather would begin to

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.540 
on there the leather would begin to
soften<00:05:36.210> in<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:37.020> similar<00:05:37.500> way<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.860> more<00:05:38.280> hot

that much more efficiently elimination

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.409 
that much more efficiently elimination
so<00:05:58.380> critical<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.010> want<00:05:59.100> to<00:05:59.340> help<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.330> body

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
so critical if you want to help the body

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.300 
so critical if you want to help the body
burn<00:06:01.050> fat<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.410> got<00:06:01.680> to<00:06:01.800> get<00:06:01.890> it<00:06:02.010> out<00:06:02.070> of<00:06:02.130> the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
burn fat you got to get it out of the

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.670 
burn fat you got to get it out of the
body<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.790> that's<00:06:03.210> done<00:06:03.510> by<00:06:03.960> increasing<00:06:04.290> your

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680

fiber<00:06:04.980> content<00:06:05.450> hunter-gatherers<00:06:06.450> got<00:06:06.630> a

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
fiber content hunter-gatherers got a

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.350 
fiber content hunter-gatherers got a
hundred<00:06:07.050> grams<00:06:07.380> of<00:06:07.590> fiber<00:06:07.800> per<00:06:08.070> day<00:06:08.190> we<00:06:08.730> get<00:06:08.940> 20

hundred grams of fiber per day we get 20

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.020 
hundred grams of fiber per day we get 20
so<00:06:09.870> we<00:06:10.350> need<00:06:10.530> to<00:06:10.620> increase<00:06:10.919> our<00:06:11.130> fiber<00:06:11.460> content

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
so we need to increase our fiber content

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.420 
so we need to increase our fiber content
