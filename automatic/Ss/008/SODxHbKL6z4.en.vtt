00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
to I'm using Swarovski chatons and it is
important<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> note<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:08.070> 1088<00:01:08.790> style

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
important to note that the 1088 style

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.410 
important to note that the 1088 style
works<00:01:10.259> with<00:01:10.499> these<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.890> 1028<00:01:11.520> does<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
works with these the 1028 does not so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
works with these the 1028 does not so
the<00:01:12.539> older<00:01:12.810> style<00:01:13.079> is<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:14.189> bit<00:01:14.399> deeper

the older style is a little bit deeper

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.330 
the older style is a little bit deeper
and<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.719> too<00:01:16.170> deep<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.770> memory<00:01:17.039> wire<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and it's too deep for the memory wire to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.590 
and it's too deep for the memory wire to
fit<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.969> you<00:01:18.060> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> make<00:01:18.570> sure

make<00:02:18.220> sure<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.790> all<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.330> way<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:21.510> on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
make sure that it's all the way down on

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.839 
make sure that it's all the way down on
all<00:02:22.900> four<00:02:23.140> sides<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.890> how<00:02:27.129> easy<00:02:27.159> it<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.610> to

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
all four sides that's how easy it is to

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.170 
all four sides that's how easy it is to
set<00:02:28.060> them<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.540> knees<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.150> to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
set them and knees so I'm just going to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:55.440 
set them and knees so I'm just going to
do<00:02:31.329> a<00:02:31.360> couple

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.180 

and<00:02:56.020> you<00:02:56.140> do<00:02:56.290> want<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.620> make<00:02:56.740> sure<00:02:56.770> that<00:02:57.099> you

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and you do want to make sure that you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.400 
and you do want to make sure that you
keep<00:02:57.400> your<00:02:59.040> your<00:03:00.040> piece<00:03:00.480> nice<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.780> even<00:03:02.290> in

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
keep your your piece nice and even in

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.150 
keep your your piece nice and even in
there<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.010> gets<00:03:04.349> moved<00:03:05.349> out<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> place<00:03:05.980> you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
there if it gets moved out of place you

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.130 
there if it gets moved out of place you
want<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.370> stop<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.790> put<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.060> back<00:03:07.209> or<00:03:07.540> else<00:03:07.989> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
want to stop and put it back or else it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.780 
want to stop and put it back or else it
won't<00:03:08.230> sit<00:03:08.560> nicely

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.740 

okay<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.620> you're<00:03:18.739> going<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.950> go<00:03:19.069> ahead<00:03:19.159> and<00:03:19.400> do

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
okay so you're going to go ahead and do

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.809 
okay so you're going to go ahead and do
as<00:03:20.750> many<00:03:21.079> as<00:03:21.349> you<00:03:21.530> want<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.980> course<00:03:22.700> with

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
as many as you want of course with

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.300 
as many as you want of course with
memory<00:03:23.090> wire<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.299> can<00:03:23.629> decide<00:03:24.049> how<00:03:24.349> many

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
memory wire you can decide how many

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.640 
memory wire you can decide how many
times<00:03:25.609> around<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.030> want<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.359> go<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:26.689> one

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
times around you want it to go this one

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.309 
times around you want it to go this one
here<00:03:27.859> is<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.040> two<00:03:28.459> loops<00:03:28.810> two<00:03:29.810> times<00:03:30.019> all<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
here is just two loops two times all the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.920 
here is just two loops two times all the
way<00:03:30.349> around<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.859> can<00:03:30.980> do<00:03:31.129> a<00:03:31.310> single<00:03:31.879> time<00:03:32.180> you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
way around you can do a single time you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.300 
way around you can do a single time you
can<00:03:33.109> fill<00:03:33.500> up<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.640> whole<00:03:34.879> thing<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.769> decide

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
can fill up the whole thing so decide

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.099 
can fill up the whole thing so decide
how<00:03:37.459> much<00:03:37.689> around<00:03:38.689> you<00:03:38.900> want<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.930> sure

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
how much around you want and be sure

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.470 
how much around you want and be sure
that<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.379> use<00:03:42.530> memory<00:03:42.950> wire<00:03:43.250> cutters<00:03:43.639> when

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
that you use memory wire cutters when

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.959 
that you use memory wire cutters when
you<00:03:44.599> cut<00:03:44.780> your<00:03:44.810> loops<00:03:45.769> I'm<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.370> showing<00:03:46.879> you

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:46.969 
you cut your loops I'm just showing you

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.580 
you cut your loops I'm just showing you
right<00:03:47.120> now<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.359> basics<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:47.989> how<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.139> put<00:03:48.439> them

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
right now the basics of how you put them

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.830 
right now the basics of how you put them
on<00:03:48.769> there<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.220> I'm<00:03:50.209> not<00:03:50.329> going<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.599> go<00:03:50.689> into

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
on there so I'm not going to go into

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.550 
on there so I'm not going to go into
that<00:03:51.019> right<00:03:51.200> now<00:03:51.379> so<00:03:52.510> once<00:03:53.510> you've<00:03:54.319> got<00:03:54.530> all

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
that right now so once you've got all

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.610 
that right now so once you've got all
your<00:03:54.799> stones<00:03:55.189> set<00:03:55.519> then<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:57.200> takes<00:03:57.379> a<00:03:57.500> little

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
your stones set then it takes a little

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.470 
your stones set then it takes a little
bit<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.859> wiggling<00:03:58.280> sometimes<00:04:01.329> but<00:04:02.329> then

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
bit of wiggling sometimes but then

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.339 
bit of wiggling sometimes but then
otherwise<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:03.319> slide<00:04:03.739> right<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:05.239> it's<00:04:06.079> just

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
otherwise they slide right on it's just

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.539 
otherwise they slide right on it's just
a<00:04:06.470> matter<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.739> finding<00:04:09.189> the<00:04:10.189> hole<00:04:10.340> at<00:04:10.519> the

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
a matter of finding the hole at the

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.440 
a matter of finding the hole at the
other<00:04:10.790> end<00:04:11.030> there<00:04:11.359> we<00:04:11.480> go

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
other end there we go

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.229 
other end there we go
and<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.620> said<00:04:15.829> the<00:04:16.009> the<00:04:16.400> older<00:04:16.669> style<00:04:17.000> of

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
and like I said the the older style of

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.650 
and like I said the the older style of
Swarovski<00:04:17.810> show<00:04:17.959> tom<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.609> little<00:04:20.180> bit<00:04:20.269> too

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
Swarovski show tom is a little bit too

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.480 
Swarovski show tom is a little bit too
deep<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.139> point<00:04:21.409> on<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.620> back<00:04:21.799> goes<00:04:22.070> too<00:04:22.280> far

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
deep the point on the back goes too far

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.760 
deep the point on the back goes too far
down<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:22.699> it<00:04:22.970> actually<00:04:23.000> keeps<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.770> memory

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
down and it actually keeps the memory

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.159 
down and it actually keeps the memory
wire<00:04:24.949> from<00:04:25.159> fitting<00:04:25.490> through<00:04:25.699> so<00:04:26.139> be<00:04:27.139> sure

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
wire from fitting through so be sure

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.600 
wire from fitting through so be sure
you're<00:04:27.530> using<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.949> 1088<00:04:29.919> if<00:04:30.919> you're<00:04:31.220> using<00:04:31.400> a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
you're using the 1088 if you're using a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.140 
you're using the 1088 if you're using a
shuttle<00:04:35.500> as<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:36.740> see<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:36.979> can<00:04:37.159> just<00:04:37.190> put

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
shuttle as you can see you can just put

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.810 
shuttle as you can see you can just put
them<00:04:38.800> throughout<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:40.130> can<00:04:40.310> put<00:04:40.490> other<00:04:40.699> items

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
them throughout you can put other items

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.960 
them throughout you can put other items
on<00:04:41.330> your<00:04:41.630> memory<00:04:42.199> wire<00:04:42.440> or<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.639> can<00:04:43.789> do<00:04:43.940> a

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
on your memory wire or you can do a

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.089 
on your memory wire or you can do a
solid<00:04:45.039> stack<00:04:46.039> of<00:04:46.220> them<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.789> I<00:04:46.909> did<00:04:46.970> here<00:04:47.389> and

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
solid stack of them like I did here and

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.159 
solid stack of them like I did here and
they're<00:04:49.099> a<00:04:49.370> really<00:04:49.849> fun<00:04:50.270> new<00:04:50.870> way<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.050> use

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
they're a really fun new way to use

00:04:51.169 --> 00:05:00.640 
they're a really fun new way to use
memory<00:04:51.680> wire

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.710 

you
