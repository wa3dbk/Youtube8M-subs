00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
all right guys just a quick update on my

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.160 
all right guys just a quick update on my
Emerson<00:00:03.750> 1895<00:00:04.500> ceiling<00:00:05.190> fan<00:00:06.649> as<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:08.580> recall

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
Emerson 1895 ceiling fan as you recall

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.379 
Emerson 1895 ceiling fan as you recall
in<00:00:10.170> my<00:00:10.490> previous<00:00:11.490> video<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.120> put<00:00:12.330> up

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
in my previous video that I put up

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.150 
in my previous video that I put up
yesterday<00:00:13.639> what<00:00:14.639> day<00:00:14.849> before<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:16.160> can't

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
yesterday what day before I can't

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.120 
yesterday what day before I can't
remember<00:00:17.359> um<00:00:20.029> it<00:00:21.029> wobbles<00:00:22.519> really<00:00:23.519> badly<00:00:25.130> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
remember um it wobbles really badly and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.810 
remember um it wobbles really badly and
I<00:00:26.430> figured<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> problem<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.820> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I figured out the problem and that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.250 
I figured out the problem and that
problem<00:00:29.849> would<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:32.809> one<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> blades

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
problem would be that one of the blades

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
problem would be that one of the blades
I<00:00:34.590> guess<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.640> lighter<00:00:35.969> than<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> other<00:00:36.510> ones

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I guess is lighter than the other ones

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
I guess is lighter than the other ones
because<00:00:37.020> they're<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.620> alignment<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
because they're all in alignment and you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.529 
because they're all in alignment and you
know<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:42.270> pitch<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> same<00:00:44.539> they're

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
know the pitch is all the same they're

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.260 
know the pitch is all the same they're
all<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.960> distance<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> ceiling

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
all the same distance from the ceiling

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
all the same distance from the ceiling
give<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.960> fraction<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.890> an

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
give or take you know a fraction of an

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
give or take you know a fraction of an
inch<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.730> 1/8<00:00:51.090> they're<00:00:51.329> 1/16<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
inch you know like 1/8 they're 1/16 of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.400 
inch you know like 1/8 they're 1/16 of
an<00:00:52.260> inch<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.500> each<00:00:52.680> other<00:00:53.719> nothing<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
an inch from each other nothing that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
an inch from each other nothing that
would<00:00:55.530> cause<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.770> huge<00:00:56.100> wobble<00:00:57.710> but<00:00:58.710> um<00:00:59.840> anyway

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
would cause a huge wobble but um anyway

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
would cause a huge wobble but um anyway
I<00:01:01.219> just<00:01:02.219> put<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.520> weights<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> one

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I just put some weights on that one

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
I just put some weights on that one
blade

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.190 

you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.230> see<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.740> black<00:01:07.890> clips<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
you can see the little black clips on it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.060 
you can see the little black clips on it
one<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> them<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> holding<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.980> quarter<00:01:11.870> also

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
one of them is holding on a quarter also

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:23.510 
one of them is holding on a quarter also
that's<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.370> temporary<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:16.190> um

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:02:12.150 

you<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.329> it<00:01:24.390> runs<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:24.780> smooth<00:01:25.049> now

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.400 

anyway<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.060> said<00:02:13.150> those<00:02:13.510> clips<00:02:14.050> are<00:02:14.230> just

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
anyway like I said those clips are just

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.640 
anyway like I said those clips are just
temporary<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:15.450> might<00:02:16.450> end<00:02:16.720> up<00:02:16.990> just<00:02:17.050> bending

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
temporary I might end up just bending

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.290 
temporary I might end up just bending
the<00:02:17.800> blade<00:02:18.010> down<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.490> make<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.790> heavier<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.270> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the blade down to make it heavier on the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.020 
the blade down to make it heavier on the
outside<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:19.990> sticking<00:02:20.560> weights<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.760> one

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
outside or sticking weights from one

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.050 
outside or sticking weights from one
with<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.330> balancing<00:02:22.780> kits<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.850> come<00:02:24.850> with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
with the balancing kits that come with

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.800 
with the balancing kits that come with
cheap<00:02:25.330> new<00:02:25.540> fans<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:28.390> sticking<00:02:28.630> those

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
cheap new fans just sticking those

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.400 
cheap new fans just sticking those
weights<00:02:29.080> on<00:02:29.230> it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
weights on it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.430 
weights on it
I<00:02:29.500> don't<00:02:29.770> know<00:02:29.830> I'm<00:02:30.550> debating

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.370 

but<00:02:35.010> um

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
but um

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.160 
but um
just<00:02:37.380> want<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.590> show<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.800> what<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> did
