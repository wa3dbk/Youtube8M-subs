 colorful shimmering and full of friends has 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.869
 met a series of wishes to 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.660
 achieve to achieve an ultimate goal 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:20.090
 rockstar father of family CEO surgeons 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.740
 brion diamonds and glass everywhere 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.839
 no doubt you are well in the country 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.450
 magical where sims life where survive 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.940
 depending on your desires 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.770
 after a solid carton on pc the 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.750
 tamagotchi modern times landed 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.400
 indeed on console to tickle the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.400
 female audience hd consoles 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 again the creation phase is already 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 a game in itself so much the possibilities are 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.380
 endless 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.300
 like in the pc version everything is 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.489
 proposed to create an avatar that you 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 looks like or not at all physically and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.940
 morally since you also need 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 choose five traits that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 determines the ultimate goal of your six 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 pieces as in any good 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.220
 simulation of life that respects all 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.320
 the choices are up to you to choose 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.180
 to work or not to work hard or 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.160
 you make it sweet all make friends 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.720
 or enemies and as always you 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.550
 can also customize houses 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.020
 the adecco furniture the total garden 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.000
 the big novelty is the arrival of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 karma that allows you to influence the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.690
 destiny according to their actions your 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.759
 sims will gain karma points that you 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.520
 can spend to help or 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.320
 curse an option that relieves drastically 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.270
 life that will not fail to do 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.130
 cringe the purists but who 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.820
 makes it even easier to access 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.820
 General public 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.530
 if you will need some time to 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.119
 take charge of the gameplay because the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.340
 joystick is not as well suited as 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.950
 the mouse automatisms are taken 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.360
 all the same quickly 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.369
 pity, however, that the game has lost 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.439
 change in graphics because 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.829
 the sims 3 on consoles offers us the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.420
 union minimum where pc version 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.030
 we offered a universe benefiting 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.829
 of a total absence of loading and 6 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.259
 well, it takes a monstrous time to 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.060
 every action of the blow the game suffers 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.069
 paradoxically a lack of rhythm 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.569
 because as it is impossible to follow 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.400
 his sim at work in transport 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.170
 or outdoor activities 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.019
 we spend long minutes waiting 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.549
 that he is available and when he is the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.269
 time passes a strangely speed 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.400
 crazy then follows a feeling 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.560
 strange of frustration mixed with a 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.989
 extreme addiction because the characters 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.549
 are totally endearing and we like 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.920
 to see them evolve grow older 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.709
 succeed to finally go or not to 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.110
 end of their dreams without marking their 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.700
 ironing the sims 3 on 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.739
 consoles gets away so all the same 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.860
 with honors while waiting for the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.860
 next 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.570
 I have news 14 of 20
