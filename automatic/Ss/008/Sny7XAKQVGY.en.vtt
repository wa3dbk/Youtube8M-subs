it as good as I installed the front
because<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.649> any<00:01:55.799> issues<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
because I don't have any issues with the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249 
because I don't have any issues with the
front<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:56.969> all<00:01:57.119> there's<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:57.600> bubbling<00:01:58.049> it's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
front at all there's no bubbling it's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.020 
front at all there's no bubbling it's
perfect<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.979> maybe<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.490> won't<00:01:59.670> replace

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
perfect so maybe I just won't replace

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.709 
perfect so maybe I just won't replace
that<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.649> when<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.299> it<00:02:03.299> should<00:02:03.509> take<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that one when I get it it should take a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
that one when I get it it should take a
few<00:02:03.990> days<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.229> ship<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.369> i<00:02:05.399> might<00:02:05.700> do

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
few days to ship out and then i might do

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
few days to ship out and then i might do
an<00:02:06.030> install<00:02:06.360> video<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.200> maybe<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.829> i<00:02:07.950> can

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
an install video on this maybe if i can

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.020 
an install video on this maybe if i can
get<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.220> better<00:02:08.399> camera<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.420> camera<00:02:09.479> sucks

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
get a better camera this camera sucks

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.650 
get a better camera this camera sucks
