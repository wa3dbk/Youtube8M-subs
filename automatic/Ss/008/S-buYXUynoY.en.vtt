00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello dear viewers of my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:11.639
 channel and today i would like to show you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.349
 knife sog trident trident is translated from 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.390
 English as a trident 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:22.250
 and in general the whole look of this knife is all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.539
 his philosophy she recalls of some kind 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:32.060
 military police mission 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.060
 flashlight show file lies for appearance 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.180
 that is what I want to say this 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.820
 knife, even in appearance can not be called 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.100
 somehow and disi cutter it too 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.739
 brutal too specific i would 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 said 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.390
 the legs we have a plastic handle 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 I will come 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.629
 I handle later even tell Steel 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.880
 blades aus-8 and blade coating 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.110
 titanium nitride to open the blade 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.979
 first you need to unlock and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.979
 then just push 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:29.799
 open knife length 216 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.799
 millimeters blade length 95 millimeters 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.030
 the handle is quite large 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.549
 I specifically put on gloves to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:49.429
 show how comfortable this knife can be 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:52.039
 hold it gloved on itself 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:58.520
 the blade is so powerful 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:00.229
 notching on allows you to hold the knife on 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.129
 the handle itself also has this on 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:13.849
 the strainer and the handle itself has a structure with 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:17.150
 in such a figure that exactly 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.690
 way of holding your hand exactly in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.690
 gloved hand 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:43.780
 blade cuff the type 1 although sometimes 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:48.800
 ordinary blade lock our club 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:53.300
 here to fold the knife you need to take 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.370
 here is this lever and with the effort to fold 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.370
 because the knife has assist 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.220
 2 back has 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.390
 for left-handed, I'm right-handed opening 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.970
 and this fuse is in my 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.950
 a look is a very important thing for 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.840
 this knife 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.690
 because all the same I think that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.390
 spring knives 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.200
 especially when they are worn type about and here 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:29.840
 there is no other option then they should have 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.030
 some kind of fixing protection here 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.700
 still implemented on this knife 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.380
 stroporez here well I tried to cut them 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.090
 cords 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.820
 such as paracord and in principle 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.070
 even now 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.950
 I will not show it because it makes sense 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.120
 no special 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.380
 the only thing that liza should be good 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.140
 sharpened on what will just simply not 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.150
 will work on the handle done here 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.150
 such a wide hole for lanyard 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.560
 clip 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.800
 our clip is pretty good 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.450
 clip with brand name juice is not for 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.780
 I certainly donâ€™t really like it when 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.900
 clips exactly this is done 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.110
 title 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.610
 but nothing less is normal 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:37.180
 I can not say an example to say the clip is deep 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:39.270
 landing what else would like to add about 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.040
 I can still tell this knife 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:47.530
 Now I will tell you why I am reminded. 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:51.480
 rifle m16 knife sog trident this such 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.310
 complex mechanism interesting 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.710
 but at the same time he has his weak 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.590
 side here on that methane is a lot of detail 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.160
 these parts are located inside the handle 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.670
 plastic for this handle by the way hollow 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.990
 that is, I did not find here any clear 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.640
 metal liners i found here 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.380
 just reinforcing elements 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.380
 that is, they showed here 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.030
 So we see here that the principle objective of 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.520
 on the plastic handle and here it is 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.910
 where exactly here these 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.260
 narrow sides here are made such 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.270
 metal inserts 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.419
 so that the design somehow strengthen 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:54.979
 there you see details of the pk lacquer mechanism and 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:58.169
 This fuse mechanism is this 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:03.860
 I think capricious to clogging that is 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:06.090
 if dirt gets there it can 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.520
 not so effective to open 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.330
 close it means it can get clogged 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.690
 sand if you dropped somewhere like 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.570
 its in the sand then it is very very negative 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.190
 will affect the mechanism to get there 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.100
 soil particles 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:26.850
 the sand will not be lost from ours 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.490
 the mechanism so here these are all 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.510
 the holes that are here on 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:38.729
 handles they certainly collect collect 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:43.530
 dirt and in principle I would not call this 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:50.669
 mechanism resistant to clogging like 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:55.460
 for example a rat there is even the most here 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.460
 of course here is this tricky castle 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.510
 5 mounting points implemented 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.510
 axial screw 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:14.180
 No, the knife has already pulled a little on the pocket 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:21.590
 he worked extremely island cutting 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:24.070
 his surface is flat enough 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.070
 thin 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:31.659
 that's all where to buy what to 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:35.289
 old singular trident ah and in common sagas 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:38.979
 there was a little different inscription 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:41.319
 that is, there is a logo and now they are 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:46.139
 slightly changed he became more so 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:51.309
 more tactical I like more 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:57.240
 so I hope you had my review 

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:57.240
 interesting useful to new meetings
