three notes and and it just goes like

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
three notes and and it just goes like
that<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> i<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.789> trying<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> explain<00:00:30.240> through

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that so i was trying to explain through

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
that so i was trying to explain through
the<00:00:31.439> message<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.610> get<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the message was that you can get the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.110 
the message was that you can get the
snow<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.960> hang<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.120> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
snow to hang out so you can up to and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
snow to hang out so you can up to and
then<00:00:36.270> four<00:00:36.840> four<00:00:37.170> four<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.430> can

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
then four four four and then you can

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.000 
then four four four and then you can
actually<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.120> notes<00:00:39.360> ring<00:00:39.570> also<00:00:42.800> if<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
actually get that notes ring also if you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
actually get that notes ring also if you
could<00:00:44.129> hear<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:48.809> doing<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
could hear it so what I'm doing is this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.670 
could hear it so what I'm doing is this
finger<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.750> sort<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.809> bending<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.440> some

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
finger is sort of bending like that some

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.990 
finger is sort of bending like that some
people's<00:00:52.949> fingers<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.969> than

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
people's fingers can do this more than

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
people's fingers can do this more than
others<00:00:54.620> just<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.890> bending<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:58.370> so

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
others just kind of bending there so

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.709 
others just kind of bending there so
this<00:00:59.520> car<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.789> just<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> pain<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this car is just a pain but you just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.090 
this car is just a pain but you just
have<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> practice<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.469> lot<00:01:01.649> eventually<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
have to practice a lot eventually get it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.750 
have to practice a lot eventually get it
another<00:01:05.100> trick<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> start

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
another trick is when you start

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.219 
another trick is when you start
strumming<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.750> sure<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
strumming it is make sure that this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
strumming it is make sure that this
finger<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> tip<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.960> hitting<00:01:09.960> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
finger or the tip of it is hitting this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.429 
finger or the tip of it is hitting this
string<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:12.170> because<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.320> you're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
string right here because when you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.719 
string right here because when you're
strumming<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.830> lot<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> times<00:01:14.220> you're<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
strumming a lot of times you're not that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.969 
strumming a lot of times you're not that
it's<00:01:15.119> hard<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.570> super<00:01:16.200> careful<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
it's hard to be super careful and you

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.149 
it's hard to be super careful and you
don't<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.310> hit<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.979> sounds<00:01:19.979> bad

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
don't want to hit this like sounds bad

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.160 
don't want to hit this like sounds bad
so<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.790> mute<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.420> case<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.720 

you're<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> hear<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.550> that's

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
you're not going to hear it and that's

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.340 
you're not going to hear it and that's
true<00:01:26.940> any<00:01:27.180> time<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:27.810> any<00:01:27.960> courts

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
true any time you're doing any courts

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
true any time you're doing any courts
based<00:01:28.620> on<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.980> a<00:01:29.220> string<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.850> fifth

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
based on the a string on the fifth

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.110 
based on the a string on the fifth
string<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.480> power<00:01:30.990> cord<00:01:32.030> because<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
string like a power cord because it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.830 
string like a power cord because it
sound<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.540> bad<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.510> just<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> good

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
sound really bad so it's just a good

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.160 
sound really bad so it's just a good
habit<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.230> get<00:01:37.410> into<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.690> once<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> learn

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
habit to get into and once you learn

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.010 
habit to get into and once you learn
this<00:01:40.350> shape<00:01:40.620> I<00:01:41.240> would<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.390> try<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.690> move<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
this shape I would then try to move it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
this shape I would then try to move it
around<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.440> guitar<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:47.400> whenever<00:01:47.640> I've

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
around the guitar like so whenever I've

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.240 
around the guitar like so whenever I've
learned<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> new<00:01:48.210> shape<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.660> guitar<00:01:49.040> or<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> new

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
learned a new shape on guitar or a new

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.510 
learned a new shape on guitar or a new
riff<00:01:51.410> I'll<00:01:52.410> just<00:01:52.590> move<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.950> around<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.490> little

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
riff I'll just move it around a little

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.620 
riff I'll just move it around a little
bit<00:01:54.890> because<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.400> size<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.000> FREX<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
bit because the size of the FREX is of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.110 
bit because the size of the FREX is of
course<00:01:57.980> smaller<00:01:58.980> as<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.370> go<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.670> guitar

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
course smaller as you go up to guitar

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.720 
course smaller as you go up to guitar
and<00:02:01.080> I'll<00:02:01.170> also<00:02:01.320> try<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:02.370> is<00:02:02.550> B

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
and I'll also try it down here this is B

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.350 
and I'll also try it down here this is B
flat<00:02:02.970> major<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.250> here's<00:02:05.400> B<00:02:05.580> measure<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.210> B

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
flat major so here's B measure this is B

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.200 
flat major so here's B measure this is B
flat<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.920> hardest<00:02:08.220> spot<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.760> it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210
