 Hi YouTubes! Welcome to this new tutorial! 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.340
 I was sick for a week but I'm almost better now so it's time to make a new video for you. 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.960
 today I will show you the velvet manicure. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 I was in doubt whether I would make this video because 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.240
 sometimes I see the velvet manicure and then I don't like it, and sometimes I see it and then I like it. 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.980
 The only way to find out if I really like it is to order it 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.660
 and try it yourself 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.720
 I have ordered this flocking powder from BornPrettyStore 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.920
 and what struck me is that if you use the dark colors it looks chic for example black, dark blue or red. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 And that is why I like this one, I don't like the lighter colors 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.700
 but that is my opinion and you must of course do what you like best! 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.780
 There are many colors to choose from and you will receive this jar with flocking powder. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.640
 There's a lot in it, I've already done my nails and there's a lot left. You only need a little bit so you can use it often 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.160
 You also get this thing that looks like a tweezer, so it's not a real tweezer but it looks like it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.680
 You use this to apply the flocking powder to your nails 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.720
 and I also got this little brush 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.180
 With this you remove the powder from your skin, so super handy! 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.540
 Of course I also use nail polish, use a color that is similar to the color of your flocking powder. 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.060
 It doesn't have to be exactly the same color, but choose one that comes close. 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.980
 I use OPI - Little Red Wagon 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.400
 This is all you need so here is the tutorial! 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.820
 Make sure you have a piece of paper under your nail because we are going to mess 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.540
 I already have 1 layer of nail polish on 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.340
 I now apply the second layer and then I will apply the flocking powder 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.660
 Make sure the powder is on your entire nail 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.940
 Now press the powder into your nail polish so that it stays in place 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.260
 do not press too hard but not too soft. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.960
 When you're done, you can use the brush to remove the powder from your skin 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.740
 The powder that is left over can be returned to the jar and used next time 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.980
 When you are done this is the result 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.940
 What do you think about it? 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.420
 For those who are wondering, yes you can still wash your hand and shower. 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.460
 I tried it, when it gets wet it looks a bit strange but it just stays put 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.700
 and in a few minutes it will be dry again and then it will look normal again 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.900
 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and see you next time!
