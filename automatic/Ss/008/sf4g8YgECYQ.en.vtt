00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.110
 Hello subscribers of my channel 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.630
 Hello, all lovers of the tank T67 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 light out patch 93 ours suffered there 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.730
 the changes are mostly made of me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
 Total 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 visual component besides the tank 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.410
 We have also changed maps 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.380
 on which we play today we 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.239
 Consider the map of the Arctic 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 no sky has changed here but 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.850
 less interesting. 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.750
 on top of the base is such a have on it 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 and now about serpentine we drive in to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 very top here in patch 92 on this point 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.449
 for some reason I could not come in I do not know 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.170
 maybe I haven't tried something even 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.189
 I do not remember here in this patch 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 easy to find the place and the way here 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:13.619
 call position is interesting because 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.689
 located near the base to go far not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:23.479
 You can work on the light can 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.000
 shine sauna on the approaches to the base very 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.990
 good review ie we work for everything 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.270
 parties if we will highlight 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.270
 can be very well seen 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 balcony 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.740
 salavat and which often leaves 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.830
 enemy from the bottom base 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.290
 now there are picked up all the bushes are selling 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.820
 they are from there from experienced players but 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:57.140
 no less than the bed constantly standing there 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.160
 you can shoot here obd 2 line 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.850
 now watched 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:07.690
 too interesting you can shoot there 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.610
 Here is the passage in the center of the enemy technology 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.270
 spring will shine we can throw in there 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.640
 even the base under it was visible that is the line 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:25.100
 78 is open to us and generally 5 6 7 8 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 lines we see everything all under the pile to us also 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.450
 very interesting moment will be here in 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.170
 squared g7 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.440
 that is, this is where we come from 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.739
 opponents climb if our comrades tyazh 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.950
 no one went there on the hill 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.380
 bushes 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.510
 which branches we can fill up 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.910
 will we have close to the enemy also 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.730
 there is 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.910
 slopes for which we can hide in 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.010
 If you have lit up , you can 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:11.860
 it will be easy to move down here and this position 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:16.970
 My opinion is very interesting and I think that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.550
 useful in battle if someone 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.780
 take advantage will get something here 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.760
 make a replay in the studio write 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.030
 look at this 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.459
 all bye subscribe to my 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.459
