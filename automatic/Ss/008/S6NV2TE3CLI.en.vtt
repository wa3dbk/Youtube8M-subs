00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello it's magic that does not exceed there today it's a pretty video 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.689
 special 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.429
 since it's an ad 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.399
 selling five-wheel cards 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.020
 6 the day of our happy days 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.179
 and cards 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.179
 for complete vehicles of respondents 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.089
 so 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.769
 he will introduce you to the cards that sees 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.039
 he had declared struggling with him 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 to him to play 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.360
 while we start during childbirth 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.670
 So this is it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.200
 it's a very good card 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.250
 Italian appointment 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.570
 originally an overview of the tram line 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.480
 ap 40 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.250
 within 60 days 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 and percent despite rates 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.260
 I make it myself 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 so again 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.280
 an inventory of fixtures 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.510
 then 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 at least three weeks with a bag too 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.030
 golf of arras baltard the cosmic fortress 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.940
 the warlord world 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.710
 I go around 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.760
 at 0 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.160
 so 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 to raise social levels the gendarmes as 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.890

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 bulgari newspapers 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.150
 so hop originally the c1 22 euros 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.370
 but I was born from the lidho 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.660
 knowing that there is one that is damaged 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.660
 but the ol perfectly playable 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 here is to clarify that even if the two go together 8 euros 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 the agreement on the sale of the sky 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.450
 so I'm dealing with 5 euros 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.049
 emc a very good megalithic site mapping when we have 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.049

 kun aguero de 3par 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:10.359

 the Canadian 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.239
 the core 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.509
 and that tibet thomas collinet 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.189
 m only some gifts left 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.189
