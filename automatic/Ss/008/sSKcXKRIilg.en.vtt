00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
this use your compressor so we're going

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.620 
this use your compressor so we're going
to<00:01:12.320> head<00:01:12.409> over<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.829> live<00:01:13.130> devices<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.030> in

the snare snare track i'm just going to
put<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.119> compressor<00:01:17.680> now<00:01:18.680> we're<00:01:18.829> just

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
put in the compressor now we're just

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.050 
put in the compressor now we're just
going<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.100> change<00:01:19.369> these<00:01:19.549> values<00:01:19.640> vary

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
going to change these values vary

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.370 
going to change these values vary
slightly<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.750> we<00:01:20.869> should<00:01:21.020> be<00:01:21.110> able<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.289> get

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
slightly and we should be able to get

slightly and we should be able to get
this<00:01:21.439> nice<00:01:21.649> compressed<00:01:22.159> punch<00:01:22.430> feel<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
this nice compressed punch feel for the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.990 
this nice compressed punch feel for the
sinner<00:01:23.659> first<00:01:24.409> thing<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:24.619> do<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:24.799> decrease<00:01:25.610> the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
sinner first thing we do is decrease the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.980 
sinner first thing we do is decrease the
threshold<00:01:26.509> are<00:01:27.409> quite<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.740> lot<00:01:28.270> for<00:01:29.270> about<00:01:29.450> 90

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
threshold are quite a lot for about 90

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.539 
threshold are quite a lot for about 90
and<00:01:30.140> 20<00:01:31.299> do<00:01:32.409> i'm<00:01:33.409> just<00:01:33.500> going<00:01:33.649> to<00:01:33.710> boost<00:01:34.189> it<00:01:34.369> up

a tiny bit just what no matter whichever
is<00:01:38.299> very<00:01:38.479> sociable<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.619> is<00:01:39.799> just<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
is very sociable this this is just the

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.740 
is very sociable this this is just the
value<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.250> i<00:01:40.399> had<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:41.720> i<00:01:41.780> put<00:01:41.959> 1.27<00:01:42.560> there<00:01:42.890> and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
value that i had so i put 1.27 there and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.389 
value that i had so i put 1.27 there and
releasing<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:44.899> just<00:01:45.470> decreased<00:01:45.920> slightly<00:01:46.069> to

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
releasing and just decreased slightly to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.679 
releasing and just decreased slightly to
about<00:01:46.670> 17<00:01:47.119> 15<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.990> half<00:01:48.110> LT<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:50.119> ratio<00:01:50.509> I'm

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
about 17 15 the half LT the ratio I'm

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.399 
about 17 15 the half LT the ratio I'm
going<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.869> boost<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.770> about<00:01:52.569> 3.8<00:01:53.569> 3.7

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.109 
I'll do I make sure the models / 1 FF 1
hat<00:02:02.859> keep<00:02:03.859> the<00:02:04.039> look<00:02:04.159> at<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.460> same<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.909> take

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
hat keep the look at the same and take

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.919 
hat keep the look at the same and take
your<00:02:05.240> makeup<00:02:05.329> off<00:02:07.509> we're<00:02:08.509> also<00:02:08.660> going<00:02:08.869> to

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
your makeup off we're also going to

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.449 
your makeup off we're also going to
boost<00:02:09.319> because<00:02:09.709> we're<00:02:09.920> taking<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> makeup

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
boost because we're taking the makeup

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.119 
boost because we're taking the makeup
off<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.780> volume<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.709> going<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:12.890> decrease

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
off that the volume is going to decrease

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.860 
off that the volume is going to decrease
quite<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> lot<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.120> we<00:02:14.269> can<00:02:14.390> press<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.660> we're

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
quite a lot as we can press this we're

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.210 
quite a lot as we can press this we're
going<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.110> make<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.410> up<00:02:15.470> by<00:02:15.530> boosting<00:02:16.099> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
going to make it up by boosting the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.750 
going to make it up by boosting the
output<00:02:16.870> by<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.049> 70<00:02:18.530> s<00:02:18.560> upon<00:02:18.799> 6.94<00:02:19.580> that's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
output by that 70 s upon 6.94 that's

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.530 
output by that 70 s upon 6.94 that's
fine<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.760> snare<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:23.450> we

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
fine and that is the snare so if we

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.850 
fine and that is the snare so if we
listen<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.900> without<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.410> compression

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
listen to it without the compression

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.229 
listen to it without the compression
first

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.750 

now<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.300> turn<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.569> compressor<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:30.050> again

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
now we turn the compressor on again

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.940 
now we turn the compressor on again
probably<00:02:31.760> hella<00:02:32.000> difference

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.559 

you

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
you

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.250 
you
you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.350 

it's<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> really<00:02:40.590> sharp<00:02:41.130> attack<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> very

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's got a really sharp attack to a very

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.809 
it's got a really sharp attack to a very
rare<00:02:42.540> shark<00:02:42.720> attack<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.040> volume<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
rare shark attack and then the volume is

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.750 
rare shark attack and then the volume is
cut<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.569> know<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.110> squashed<00:02:46.760> afterwards

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
cut you know kind of squashed afterwards

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.090 
cut you know kind of squashed afterwards
to<00:02:47.940> really<00:02:48.209> do<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.450> snappy<00:02:48.780> feeling<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
to really do this snappy feeling and the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.559 
to really do this snappy feeling and the
way<00:02:50.190> I've<00:02:50.310> mixed<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.180> very<00:02:51.420> simple

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
way I've mixed this in this very simple

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.330 
way I've mixed this in this very simple
drum<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.020> because<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.740> has<00:02:52.860> lost<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.190> bit<00:02:53.310> of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
drum it because it has lost a bit of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
drum it because it has lost a bit of
volume<00:02:53.520> for<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.000> I've<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.630> made<00:02:54.930> sure<00:02:54.989> that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
volume for that I've just made sure that

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.590 
volume for that I've just made sure that
I've<00:02:55.739> decreased<00:02:56.430> every<00:02:56.850> single<00:02:57.150> element<00:02:57.270> in

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
I've decreased every single element in

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.840 
I've decreased every single element in
then<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.560> live<00:02:58.770> by<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.160> four<00:02:59.520> deaths<00:02:59.730> of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
then this live by about four deaths of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.090 
then this live by about four deaths of
those<00:02:59.970> over<00:03:00.330> here<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.630> mix<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.080> parking<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
those over here in the mix I parking the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.650 
those over here in the mix I parking the
snare<00:03:02.489> which<00:03:02.670> I've<00:03:02.819> kind<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.060> been<00:03:03.209> decreased

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
snare which I've kind of been decreased

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.600 
snare which I've kind of been decreased
by<00:03:03.780> two<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.860> means<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.280> stops<00:03:05.489> it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
by two this just means that it stops it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.150 
by two this just means that it stops it
from<00:03:05.670> clipping<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.500> master<00:03:07.890> track

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
from clipping in the in the master track

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.340 
from clipping in the in the master track
I<00:03:08.370> wants<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.880> avoid<00:03:09.090> putting<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.600> limited<00:03:09.959> and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
I wants to avoid putting a limited and

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.600 
I wants to avoid putting a limited and
just<00:03:10.500> boosting<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.830> volume<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.280> limiter

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
just boosting the volume to the limiter

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.040 
just boosting the volume to the limiter
because<00:03:11.850> anything<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.269> use<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> compassion

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
because anything you use the compassion

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.449 
because anything you use the compassion
completely<00:03:13.530> I'm<00:03:14.070> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> turn<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
completely I'm going to turn the

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.650 
completely I'm going to turn the
compressor<00:03:14.640> off<00:03:14.910> against<00:03:15.239> listen<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
compressor off against listen to the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:26.990 
compressor off against listen to the
little<00:03:15.780> ones<00:03:24.890> aren't<00:03:25.890> gonna<00:03:26.040> turn<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> press

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
little ones aren't gonna turn a press

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.610 
little ones aren't gonna turn a press
back<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.330> again<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> bike<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
back on again and so this is a bike a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.620 
back on again and so this is a bike a
basic<00:03:37.980> template<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.519> can<00:03:38.940> use<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.510> can

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
basic template then you can use you can

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.970 
basic template then you can use you can
fill<00:03:39.900> around<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> numbers<00:03:40.590> if<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.769> want

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
fill around so the numbers if you want

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.620 
fill around so the numbers if you want
but<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.910> be<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> basic<00:03:42.360> idea<00:03:42.420> of

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
but this is just to be a basic idea of

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.330 
but this is just to be a basic idea of
how<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.810> get<00:03:42.930> out<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.350> snappy<00:03:43.709> feeling<00:03:44.100> I've

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
how to get out that snappy feeling I've

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.949 
how to get out that snappy feeling I've
got<00:03:44.459> any<00:03:44.549> questions<00:03:44.790> about<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.299> let<00:03:45.870> me
