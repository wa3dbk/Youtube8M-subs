can see that my defensive structure is
level<00:00:53.520> eight<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> find<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:54.600> how

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
level eight so I'm going to find out how

that<00:01:14.340> level<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.880> barbarians<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.990> knowing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that level for barbarians so knowing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
that level for barbarians so knowing
this<00:01:16.680> information<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.759> achieve

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this information you can achieve

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480 
this information you can achieve
identify<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:19.229> base<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:20.040> attack<00:01:20.340> for

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
identify which base you can attack for

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
identify which base you can attack for
example<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.939> action<00:01:21.509> level<00:01:22.259> five<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
example this action level five is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
example this action level five is
actually<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.280> damaged<00:01:23.970> by<00:01:24.119> choice<00:01:24.360> 30<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually a damaged by choice 30 so it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
actually a damaged by choice 30 so it
takes<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.500> three<00:01:25.740> shots<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.549> kill<00:01:26.759> my<00:01:26.970> one

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
takes about three shots to kill my one

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.620 
takes about three shots to kill my one
barbarian<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.890> effectively<00:01:29.630> know

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
barbarian so I you can effectively know

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
barbarian so I you can effectively know
where<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> weakest<00:01:31.680> part<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> base

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
where is the weakest part of the base

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.399 
where is the weakest part of the base
from<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.180> see<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.720> I've<00:01:34.140> chosen

from here you can see that I've chosen
that<00:01:35.070> Archer<00:01:35.520> Level<00:01:35.939> 5's<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.630> weakest<00:01:37.170> part

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that Archer Level 5's the weakest part

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740 
that Archer Level 5's the weakest part
is<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.159> remember<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> zoom<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.420> scout

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
there's not well defended for example

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.520 
there's not well defended for example
the<00:01:44.970> lower<00:01:45.390> left<00:01:45.689> side<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.409> from

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
going to drop some barbarians and copies

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
going to drop some barbarians and copies
in<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.470> destroy<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.280> inner<00:02:11.580> part<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
in to destroy the inner part of the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
in to destroy the inner part of the
first<00:02:12.690> layer

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
first layer

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.649 
first layer
and<00:02:13.799> now<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:14.519> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.730> put<00:02:14.879> some<00:02:14.909> wall

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
and now I'm going to put some wall

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.720 
and now I'm going to put some wall
breakers<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.560> destroy<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> second<00:02:17.459> layer

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
breakers to destroy the second layer

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.000 
breakers to destroy the second layer
this<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.299> level<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.989> what<00:02:19.230> breaker<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.769> I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
this is a level for what breaker so I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.520 
this is a level for what breaker so I
expect<00:02:20.730> them<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.269> bit<00:02:21.720> much<00:02:22.170> more

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
expect them to be a bit much more

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.949 
expect them to be a bit much more
resistant<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.159> attacks<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.939> from<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:24.900> you

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
resistant to attacks and from here you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.539 
resistant to attacks and from here you
can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.439> that<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.769> actually<00:02:25.920> destroyed<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
can see that you actually destroyed the

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.960 
can see that you actually destroyed the
second<00:02:26.909> layer<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.780> rest<00:02:28.079> is<00:02:28.319> history<00:02:28.970> so

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
second layer and the rest is history so

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.809 
second layer and the rest is history so
what<00:02:30.359> this<00:02:30.629> video<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.500> about<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.519> know<00:02:32.790> your

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
what this video is about is to know your

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.750 
what this video is about is to know your
enemy<00:02:33.329> well<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.859> your<00:02:35.159> own<00:02:35.370> troops

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
enemy well and know your own troops

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640 
enemy well and know your own troops
without<00:02:36.000> knowing<00:02:36.659> their<00:02:36.930> strengths<00:02:37.439> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
without knowing their strengths and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.339 
without knowing their strengths and
weaknesses<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.400> your<00:02:38.489> enemy<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.689> your<00:02:40.200> own

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
weaknesses of your enemy and your own

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.770 
weaknesses of your enemy and your own
troops<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.730> t<00:02:41.909> have<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.390> greater

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
troops so that you can t have a greater

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.559 
troops so that you can t have a greater
chance<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.769> success<00:02:43.879> when<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:45.120> choose<00:02:45.420> an

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
chance of success when you choose an

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.289 
chance of success when you choose an
enemy<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.109> attack<00:02:46.709> obviously<00:02:47.489> what<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.819> do<00:02:47.970> is

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
enemy to attack obviously what I do is

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.270 
enemy to attack obviously what I do is
go<00:02:48.659> through<00:02:48.690> experience<00:02:49.440> trial<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.920> error<00:02:50.099> to

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
go through experience trial and error to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.270 
go through experience trial and error to
gauge<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.180> performance<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> strength<00:02:53.040> of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
gauge the performance or the strength of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.670 
gauge the performance or the strength of
my<00:02:53.310> own<00:02:53.609> truth<00:02:53.940> versus<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.720> enemy<00:02:55.049> towers<00:02:55.409> of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
my own truth versus the enemy towers of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.550 
my own truth versus the enemy towers of
different<00:02:56.310> types<00:02:56.579> which<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.560> amazingly

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
different types which is amazingly

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.039 
different types which is amazingly
difficult<00:02:58.859> because<00:02:59.280> every<00:02:59.760> time<00:03:00.060> every<00:03:00.329> base

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
difficult because every time every base

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.229 
difficult because every time every base
is<00:03:01.379> different<00:03:01.889> and<00:03:02.040> they're<00:03:02.340> their<00:03:02.700> towels

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
is different and they're their towels

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.500 
is different and they're their towels
levels<00:03:03.689> are<00:03:03.870> different<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:04.980> need<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.519> keep

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
levels are different so you need to keep

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.559 
levels are different so you need to keep
on<00:03:06.750> trying<00:03:07.170> many<00:03:07.769> many<00:03:07.980> times<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.000> now<00:03:09.299> with

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
on trying many many times so now with

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.530 
on trying many many times so now with
that<00:03:09.599> chart<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.680> hand<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.220> legend<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
powers at hand you can actually get if

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800 
powers at hand you can actually get if

you are really over your trophies that

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.930 
you are really over your trophies that
you're<00:03:18.989> actually<00:03:19.109> having<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.919> lot<00:03:19.949> of<00:03:20.190> trouble

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
you're actually having a lot of trouble

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.020 
you're actually having a lot of trouble
attacking<00:03:21.569> basis<00:03:22.470> with<00:03:22.680> high-level<00:03:23.030> powers

attacking basis with high-level powers

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.629 
attacking basis with high-level powers
you<00:03:24.510> can't<00:03:24.780> reuse<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.500> chart<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.069> find<00:03:26.489> out

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
you can't reuse that chart and find out

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.909 
you can't reuse that chart and find out
what's<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.150> battle<00:03:27.569> zone<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:28.590> battle<00:03:28.889> zone

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
what's the battle zone the battle zone

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.930 
what's the battle zone the battle zone
is<00:03:29.310> about<00:03:29.699> the<00:03:30.000> three<00:03:30.599> shots<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.859> need<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:32.639> if

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
is about the three shots you need so if

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.909 
is about the three shots you need so if

you can achieve three shots before you
