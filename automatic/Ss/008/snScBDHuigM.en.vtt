who<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
who I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
who I
I<00:02:13.120> kind<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.599> feel<00:02:13.720> like<00:02:13.780> I'm<00:02:13.989> anti<00:02:14.379> hipster<00:02:14.860> but

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
I kind of feel like I'm anti hipster but

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
I kind of feel like I'm anti hipster but
that's<00:02:15.489> like<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> hipster<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.510> form<00:02:16.780> of

that's like a hipster in the form of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's like a hipster in the form of
itself<00:02:17.260> if<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:18.099> makes<00:02:18.280> any<00:02:18.430> sense<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.030> do

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
itself if that makes any sense but I do

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.210 
itself if that makes any sense but I do

work<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.250> worked<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:51.640> well<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.120> my

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
work and it worked really well in my

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.670 
work and it worked really well in my
opinion<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.720> played<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:52.989> lot<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.260> heavy<00:02:53.349> duty

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
opinion I played a lot of heavy duty

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.780 
opinion I played a lot of heavy duty
when<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.920> was<00:02:54.010> out<00:02:54.160> there<00:02:54.340> weren't<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.579> ton<00:02:54.610> of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
when it was out there weren't a ton of

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.339 
when it was out there weren't a ton of
people<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.209> there<00:02:55.329> so<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.540> didn't<00:02:55.720> spend<00:02:55.840> all<00:02:56.019> my

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
people in there so I didn't spend all my

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.229 
people in there so I didn't spend all my
time<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.739> there<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.069> say<00:02:57.519> while<00:02:57.849> was<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.209> I

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
time in there I say while was that I

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.030 
time in there I say while was that I
probably<00:02:58.510> spent<00:02:58.900> fifty<00:02:59.349> percent<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.739> my<00:02:59.829> time

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.500 
know that that's kind of what happens
and<00:03:33.160> when<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.519> play<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.760> lot<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.030> Call<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.239> Duty

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
and when you play a lot of Call of Duty

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.030 
and when you play a lot of Call of Duty
I<00:03:34.540> mean<00:03:34.750> I'm<00:03:34.900> not<00:03:35.170> trying<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.530> give<00:03:35.650> any<00:03:35.799> tips

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
I mean I'm not trying to give any tips

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.500 
I mean I'm not trying to give any tips
here<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:36.639> if<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.819> guys<00:03:36.910> were<00:03:37.120> looking<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.389> get

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
here but if you guys were looking to get

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.000 
here but if you guys were looking to get
better<00:03:37.630> call<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:38.049> duty<00:03:38.260> you're<00:03:38.560> gonna<00:03:38.709> want<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
better call of duty you're gonna want to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.710 
better call of duty you're gonna want to
play<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.220> lot<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.489> call<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.700> duty<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.420> think

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
play a lot of call of duty so I think

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.420 
play a lot of call of duty so I think
black<00:03:41.079> ops<00:03:41.290> 2<00:03:41.470> did<00:03:41.620> really<00:03:41.829> well<00:03:41.889> I<00:03:42.040> think<00:03:42.220> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
black ops 2 did really well I think it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.949 
black ops 2 did really well I think it
would<00:03:42.519> be<00:03:42.549> cool<00:03:42.819> if<00:03:42.880> call<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.450> duty<00:03:43.630> ghosts

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
would be cool if call of duty ghosts

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.509 
would be cool if call of duty ghosts
were<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.590> actually<00:03:44.739> increase<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.250> health

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
were to actually increase the health

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.670 
were to actually increase the health
it's<00:03:45.849> already<00:03:46.239> March<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:47.349> even<00:03:47.530> almost

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
it's already March actually even almost

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.920 
it's already March actually even almost
April<00:03:48.099> today<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> 24th<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.510> think<00:03:49.630> would

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
April today is the 24th so I think would

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.170 
April today is the 24th so I think would
be<00:03:50.019> cool<00:03:50.230> if<00:03:50.470> they<00:03:50.620> did<00:03:50.950> if<00:03:51.250> they<00:03:51.880> really<00:03:52.060> did

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
be cool if they did if they really did

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.610 
be cool if they did if they really did
increase<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.720> health<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:53.049> think<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:53.380> kind<00:03:53.560> of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
increase the health I think it's kind of

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.500 
increase the health I think it's kind of
unlikely<00:03:53.919> but<00:03:54.639> you<00:03:54.910> know<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.209> can<00:03:55.389> always

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
unlikely but you know one can always

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.449 
unlikely but you know one can always
dream<00:03:55.630> one<00:03:56.109> can<00:03:56.290> always<00:03:56.410> hope<00:03:56.530> black<00:03:57.040> ops<00:03:57.190> 2

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
dream one can always hope black ops 2

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.770

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.830 
and everything I mean I'm sure they did
something's<00:04:00.970> wrong<00:04:01.209> like<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.510> bouncing

really<00:04:06.370> cool<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.510> they<00:04:07.630> don't<00:04:07.720> have<00:04:07.840> death

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139
