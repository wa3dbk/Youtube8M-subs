China<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:22.600> less<00:04:23.600> threatening<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:25.990> should<00:04:26.990> you

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
China is less threatening so should you

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.720

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
I would say that owning Huawei phone is

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.440 
I would say that owning Huawei phone is
a<00:04:32.570> good<00:04:32.840> thing<00:04:33.020> because<00:04:33.820> everybody<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.270> a

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
a good thing because everybody it's a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.129 
a good thing because everybody it's a
feeling<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.200> goodwill<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.900> don't<00:04:38.960> think

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
feeling of goodwill and I don't think

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.360 
feeling of goodwill and I don't think
that<00:04:39.380> if<00:04:40.130> Huawei<00:04:40.940> gives<00:04:41.930> phones<00:04:42.470> or<00:04:42.889> bags<00:04:43.190> of

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.280 
business
maybe<00:05:10.370> it's<00:05:10.580> similar<00:05:11.090> what<00:05:11.660> do<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.810> think<00:05:11.990> and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
maybe it's similar what do you think and

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.980 
maybe it's similar what do you think and
the<00:05:12.890> business<00:05:13.190> culture<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.910> Huawei<00:05:14.630> is

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
the business culture of Huawei is

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.680 
the business culture of Huawei is
probably<00:05:15.860> pretty<00:05:16.490> similar<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.419> business

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
probably pretty similar to the business

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.320 
probably pretty similar to the business
culture<00:05:17.870> of<00:05:18.110> other<00:05:18.400> companies<00:05:19.400> take<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.090> look

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
culture of other companies take a look

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.780 
culture of other companies take a look
at<00:05:20.450> ZTE

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
at ZTE

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.150 
at ZTE
right<00:05:22.790> I<00:05:23.479> think<00:05:24.080> from<00:05:24.530> what<00:05:24.560> we<00:05:24.770> read<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.040> the

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
right I think from what we read in the

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.550 
right I think from what we read in the
news<00:05:25.340> it's<00:05:25.669> pretty<00:05:25.880> similar<00:05:26.240> but<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.350> don't

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
news it's pretty similar but I don't

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.650 
news it's pretty similar but I don't
think<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:28.100> Huawei<00:05:28.580> should<00:05:29.060> be<00:05:29.180> singled<00:05:29.570> out

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
think that Huawei should be singled out

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.740 
think that Huawei should be singled out
and<00:05:30.500> get<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:31.040> much<00:05:31.160> attention<00:05:31.479> when<00:05:32.479> they<00:05:32.600> give

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
and get so much attention when they give

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.450 
and get so much attention when they give
a<00:05:32.780> gift<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:34.190> know<00:05:34.340> we<00:05:35.210> should<00:05:35.390> say<00:05:35.570> thank<00:05:35.990> you
