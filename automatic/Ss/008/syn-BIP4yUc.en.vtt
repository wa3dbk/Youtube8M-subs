00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.520 
system which is a extruded
patent-pending<00:01:12.180> rail<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.930> goes<00:01:12.960> along<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
patent-pending rail that goes along the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
patent-pending rail that goes along the
sides<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> boat<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.520> adding<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.090> removing

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
sides of the boat for adding or removing

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
sides of the boat for adding or removing
accessories<00:01:16.080> yes<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.650> here

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
accessories yes right here

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.070 
accessories yes right here
yeah<00:01:17.340> that's<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.270> got<00:01:18.450> twelve<00:01:18.750> sides

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
yeah that's it's it's got twelve sides

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
yeah that's it's it's got twelve sides
so<00:01:19.350> each<00:01:19.530> adjustment<00:01:19.860> gives<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.460> 30<00:01:20.790> degrees

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so each adjustment gives you 30 degrees

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
so each adjustment gives you 30 degrees
and<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:23.009> quick<00:01:23.310> easy<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> simple<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and it's really quick easy and simple to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
and it's really quick easy and simple to
add<00:01:24.900> whatever<00:01:25.140> accessory<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.100> yeah

add whatever accessory you want yeah

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 
add whatever accessory you want yeah
because<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> rails<00:01:27.540> under<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> PA

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
because then the rails under on the PA

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.760 
because then the rails under on the PA
before<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.670> been<00:01:29.880> rounded<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.020> whatever<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
before has been rounded so whatever you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
before has been rounded so whatever you
clamp<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> tends<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> spin<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.119> bit

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
clamp on that tends to spin a little bit

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.929 
clamp on that tends to spin a little bit
exactly<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.860> know<00:01:34.979> having<00:01:35.340> those<00:01:35.460> angles

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
exactly so you know having those angles

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
exactly so you know having those angles
is<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> give<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> strength<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
is going to give you that strength and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.819 
is going to give you that strength and
an<00:01:38.130> ability<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:39.960> angle<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
an ability to you know angle it in in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
an ability to you know angle it in in
different<00:01:41.189> ways<00:01:41.479> now<00:01:42.479> let<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:42.780> ask<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.049> this

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
different ways now let me ask you this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.570 
no fuel all the advantages of of a kayak
or<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.989> human<00:02:23.319> powered<00:02:23.530> boat<00:02:23.769> yeah<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> was

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
or a human powered boat yeah I was

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.949 
or a human powered boat yeah I was
thinking<00:02:24.879> also<00:02:25.060> once<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.599> get<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.870> your

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
thinking also once you get to your

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.080 
thinking also once you get to your
destination<00:02:26.080> using<00:02:26.709> human<00:02:27.190> power<00:02:27.549> because<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
destination using human power because a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.030 
destination using human power because a
lot<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.269> places<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:29.080> fish<00:02:29.230> are<00:02:29.379> at<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
lot of places that the fish are at is a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.369 
lot of places that the fish are at is a
no<00:02:30.280> motor<00:02:30.519> zone<00:02:30.760> area<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.629> once<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.959> get<00:02:32.110> there

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
no motor zone area so once you get there

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.020 
no motor zone area so once you get there
especially<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:32.920> fly-fishing<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.910> can

add via h-bar on the front you can add a
stripping<00:03:32.139> basket<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.130> it's<00:03:33.970> a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
stripping basket to that so it's a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.300 
stripping basket to that so it's a
really<00:03:34.299> really<00:03:34.599> versatile<00:03:35.290> boat<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.040> think

that area that's why we kind of came up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.689 
that area that's why we kind of came up
with<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.220> with<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.120> 17<00:04:26.720> feet<00:04:26.990> we<00:04:27.699> experimented

with a with that 17 feet we experimented

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.189 
with a with that 17 feet we experimented
with<00:04:28.940> two<00:04:29.330> or<00:04:29.479> three<00:04:29.510> or<00:04:29.750> four<00:04:29.960> different

with two or three or four different
hulls<00:04:30.590> before<00:04:31.010> this<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:31.880> it's<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.090> it's<00:04:32.389> its<00:04:32.540> own

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
hulls before this so it's a it's its own

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.560 
hulls before this so it's a it's its own
boat<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:34.070> know<00:04:34.160> a<00:04:34.490> lot<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.970> work<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.360> research

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
boat you know a lot of work and research

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.689 
boat you know a lot of work and research
went<00:04:36.020> into<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.889> think<00:04:37.370> we're<00:04:37.550> pretty

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
went into it and I think we're pretty

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.610 
went into it and I think we're pretty
happy<00:04:37.940> with<00:04:38.240> what<00:04:38.300> how<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.810> came<00:04:38.960> out<00:04:39.199> here<00:04:39.440> I

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
happy with what how it came out here I

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.460 
happy with what how it came out here I
see<00:04:40.490> also<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:40.970> got<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.240> bunch<00:04:41.510> multiple<00:04:42.260> holes

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
see also you got a bunch multiple holes

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.760 
see also you got a bunch multiple holes
for<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.979> Mirage<00:04:43.250> drive<00:04:43.580> system<00:04:44.000> as<00:04:44.090> well

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
for the Mirage drive system as well

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.260 
for the Mirage drive system as well
which<00:04:45.770> is<00:04:46.010> pretty<00:04:46.460> cool<00:04:46.669> I<00:04:46.760> guess<00:04:46.790> because<00:04:47.120> you
