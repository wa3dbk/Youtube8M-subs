the basic pose of just swinging the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
the basic pose of just swinging the
shield<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> front<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.949> looks<00:00:20.160> completely

shield in front it looks completely
protected<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.449> swing<00:00:22.289> mechanism<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
protected and that swing mechanism is

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.670 
protected and that swing mechanism is
working<00:00:23.880> wonders<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.510> far<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.990> no<00:00:25.260> problems

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
working wonders so far with no problems

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.240 
working wonders so far with no problems
with<00:00:25.920> loose<00:00:26.189> joints<00:00:27.949> selecting<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> shield

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
with loose joints selecting the shield

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.980 
with loose joints selecting the shield
forward<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.730> no<00:00:29.849> problem<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.750> try<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
forward is no problem but as you try to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
forward is no problem but as you try to
slide<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> back<00:00:31.740> you'll<00:00:32.040> notice<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.460> unlike

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
slide it back you'll notice that unlike

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.400 
slide it back you'll notice that unlike
the<00:00:32.940> high<00:00:33.090> grade<00:00:33.300> these<00:00:33.540> white<00:00:33.840> parts<00:00:34.140> come<00:00:34.290> up

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the high grade these white parts come up

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.139 
the high grade these white parts come up
a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.680> bit<00:00:34.829> high<00:00:35.010> which<00:00:35.790> means<00:00:35.969> that

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a little bit high which means that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.060 
a little bit high which means that
they're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> bang<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.440> assembly

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
they're going to bang into that assembly

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
they're going to bang into that assembly
here<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> spin<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
here and not be able to spin it back of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.080 
here and not be able to spin it back of
course<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.920> defeat<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.219> by<00:00:41.910> just

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
course you can defeat that by just

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
course you can defeat that by just
bending<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.660> around<00:00:42.960> somewhere<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.829> but

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
bending it around somewhere here but

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
bending it around somewhere here but
you're<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.940> able<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> keep<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you're not going to be able to keep it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
you're not going to be able to keep it
over<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> shoulder<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.559> swing<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.670> as

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
over the shoulder and swing it back as

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.430 
over the shoulder and swing it back as
much<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> could<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> high<00:00:49.020> grade

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the hip armor has fallen off far too

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.610 
the hip armor has fallen off far too
many<00:00:54.120> times<00:00:54.360> as<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> bunch<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> other

many times as have a bunch of other

many times as have a bunch of other
parts<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.390> other<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> fact<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
parts and other than the fact that the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.360 
parts and other than the fact that the
shoulder<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.559> always<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.039> dragging

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
him back into the left again because of

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.579 
him back into the left again because of
the<00:01:02.160> freedom<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> swivel<00:01:03.210> mechanism

the freedom and the swivel mechanism

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
the freedom and the swivel mechanism
there's<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> things<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there's really not a lot of things that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
there's really not a lot of things that
you're<00:01:06.479> limited<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you're limited in what you can do by the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.310 
you're limited in what you can do by the
fact<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.790> he's<00:01:08.939> got<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.150> huge<00:01:09.450> shield<00:01:09.900> on

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.399 

the<00:01:13.320> shields<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.920> everything<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:15.409> really

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the shields with everything out really

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.399 
the shields with everything out really
does<00:01:16.860> add<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> look<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> Menace<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.409> attacked

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
does add a look of Menace and attacked

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.570 
does add a look of Menace and attacked
as<00:01:19.650> something<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> should<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.280> used

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
as something that should be used

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.149 
as something that should be used
primarily<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.420> defensive<00:01:22.350> purposes<00:01:22.380> with

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
primarily for defensive purposes with

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
primarily for defensive purposes with
the<00:01:23.189> shield<00:01:23.549> bits<00:01:23.820> off<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.420> remember<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the shield bits off and remember to do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
the shield bits off and remember to do
that<00:01:25.020> carefully<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that carefully it's really good that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
that carefully it's really good that
you're<00:01:26.909> able<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.150> slide<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.659> white<00:01:27.990> parts

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you're able to slide these white parts

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
you're able to slide these white parts
up<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.950> firms<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> whole<00:01:30.180> shield

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
up because it firms up the whole shield

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
up because it firms up the whole shield
and<00:01:30.659> makes<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.320> much<00:01:31.380> solid<00:01:32.040> even

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and makes it look that much solid even

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
and makes it look that much solid even
though<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.970> lost<00:01:33.299> most<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.930> its<00:01:34.049> bulk<00:01:34.320> with

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
though it's lost most of its bulk with

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
though it's lost most of its bulk with

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
this in Buster rifle mode you'll notice

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
this in Buster rifle mode you'll notice
that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> handle<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.159> fit<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> hand

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that the handle will fit into the hand

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.550 
that the handle will fit into the hand
but<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.570> bit<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.900> well<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
but it's a little bit it's well not a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.319 
but it's a little bit it's well not a
little<00:01:40.860> bit<00:01:41.009> difficult<00:01:41.189> quite<00:01:41.640> difficult<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
little bit difficult quite difficult to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.359 
little bit difficult quite difficult to
get<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> part<00:01:43.470> lined<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.040> give<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
extra support that it needs from the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
extra support that it needs from the
forearm<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
forearm there you have to have the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.030 
forearm there you have to have the
camera<00:01:48.299> moved<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> way<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.799> try<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
camera moved all the way back to try to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
camera moved all the way back to try to
get<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.540> shot<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:53.060> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> hold

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
get this into the shot and if you hold

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.469 
get this into the shot and if you hold
that<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:55.460> well<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> goes<00:01:56.759> sort<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.299> as

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that up well there it goes sort of as

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.080 
that up well there it goes sort of as
expected

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
expected

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
expected
now<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.360> doesn't<00:02:00.659> work<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> may

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now that doesn't work at all as you may

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.530 
now that doesn't work at all as you may
have<00:02:02.219> seen<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> fall<00:02:02.939> there<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
have seen with the fall there one of the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.200 
have seen with the fall there one of the
flaws<00:02:03.810> here<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> these<00:02:04.770> drives<00:02:05.310> do<00:02:06.030> not

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
flaws here is that these drives do not

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.749 
flaws here is that these drives do not
stay<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> casing<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.580> it's

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
stay very well into the casing so it's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.339 
stay very well into the casing so it's
very<00:02:09.000> possible<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.660> course<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.989> falls<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.319> bit

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
very possible of course it falls a bit

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.010 
very possible of course it falls a bit
of<00:02:10.530> an<00:02:10.619> exception<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:12.300> part<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.780> pop

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
of an exception but this part can pop

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.610 
of an exception but this part can pop
out<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
out and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.559 
out and
that<00:02:13.799> does<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.340> dislodge<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.970> gray<00:02:15.299> part

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
that does it can dislodge this gray part

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
that does it can dislodge this gray part
and<00:02:15.840> when<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.080> does<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.950> dislodges<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
and when that does that it dislodges the

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.630 
and when that does that it dislodges the
whole<00:02:17.849> shield<00:02:18.299> attachment<00:02:19.430> before<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.459> get

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
whole shield attachment before I get

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.949 
whole shield attachment before I get
this<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.940> nice<00:02:21.120> pose<00:02:21.390> though<00:02:21.599> I<00:02:21.629> want<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
this on a nice pose though I want to

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.330 
this on a nice pose though I want to
talk<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> little<00:02:22.769> bit<00:02:22.920> about<00:02:23.069> how

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
talk about a little bit about how

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.190 
talk about a little bit about how
frustrating<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.510> into<00:02:24.659> place

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
frustrating this is to get into place

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.750 
frustrating this is to get into place
because<00:02:25.890> when<00:02:26.040> you're<00:02:26.159> trying<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.459> attach

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
because when you're trying to attach

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640 
because when you're trying to attach
this<00:02:26.970> into<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.900> hand<00:02:28.140> remember<00:02:28.530> you're

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
this into just the hand remember you're

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.080 
this into just the hand remember you're
not<00:02:28.739> going<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.069> any<00:02:29.310> support<00:02:29.700> from<00:02:29.909> this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
not going to get any support from this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.360 
not going to get any support from this
because<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.720> plugs<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.950> doesn't

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
because as it plugs in it doesn't

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.220 
because as it plugs in it doesn't
actually<00:02:32.519> Lodge<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.659> any<00:02:33.780> way<00:02:33.989> shape

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
actually Lodge in there in any way shape

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.229 
actually Lodge in there in any way shape
or<00:02:34.379> form<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.890> you've<00:02:35.370> got<00:02:35.519> this<00:02:35.670> supporting<00:02:36.150> of

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
or form so you've got this supporting of

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.850 
or form so you've got this supporting of
which<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.510> great<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.049> you<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.650> this

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
which is great but you just have this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.940 
which is great but you just have this
one<00:02:37.920> tiny<00:02:38.760> peg<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.420> manipulator<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.680> hold

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
one tiny peg on the manipulator to hold

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.039 
one tiny peg on the manipulator to hold
up<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.340> whole<00:02:41.549> weight<00:02:41.879> of<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.090> weapon<00:02:42.420> unless

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
up the whole weight of the weapon unless

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.839 
up the whole weight of the weapon unless
you<00:02:43.170> bring<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.500> other<00:02:43.530> arm<00:02:43.709> around<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
you bring the other arm around but the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.369 
you bring the other arm around but the
problem<00:02:45.209> about<00:02:45.390> doing<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.230> you've

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
problem about doing that is that you've

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.199 
problem about doing that is that you've
got<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.650> giant<00:02:46.709> stand<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> way<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:47.940> his

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
got this giant stand in the way of his

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.720 
got this giant stand in the way of his
feet<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:49.500> see<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.099> isn't<00:02:50.549> as

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
feet so you can see that this isn't as

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.400 
feet so you can see that this isn't as
easy<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.750> make<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.049> look<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
easy as they make it look on the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.149 
easy as they make it look on the
packaging<00:02:53.209> more<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.540> more<00:02:55.019> frustrating<00:02:58.159> now

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
packaging more and more frustrating now

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.740 
packaging more and more frustrating now
I've<00:02:59.280> given<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.000> idea<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.359> trying<00:03:00.629> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I've given up on the idea of trying to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.759 
I've given up on the idea of trying to
make<00:03:00.840> him<00:03:01.170> look<00:03:01.349> cool<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.489> pose<00:03:03.769> but

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
make him look cool in this pose but

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.259 
make him look cool in this pose but
there's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> couple<00:03:05.250> problems<00:03:05.489> here<00:03:06.060> with<00:03:06.239> a

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
there's a couple problems here with a

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.259 
there's a couple problems here with a
Buster<00:03:06.659> rifle<00:03:06.920> first<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.129> all<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.370> hole<00:03:08.579> that

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
Buster rifle first of all the hole that

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.390 
Buster rifle first of all the hole that
attaches<00:03:09.629> that<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.290> put<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.590> stand<00:03:10.859> into<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
attaches that you put the stand into the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.979 
attaches that you put the stand into the
Buster<00:03:11.700> rifle<00:03:11.849> could<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.299> been<00:03:12.450> deeper<00:03:12.840> so

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
Buster rifle could have been deeper so

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.050 
Buster rifle could have been deeper so
that<00:03:13.109> will<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:13.379> in<00:03:13.500> there<00:03:13.620> properly<00:03:13.859> but<00:03:14.819> here

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that will go in there properly but here

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.399 
that will go in there properly but here
what<00:03:15.209> happens<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.629> you've<00:03:15.810> got<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> peg

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
what happens is you've got the peg

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.839 
what happens is you've got the peg
poking<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.159> way<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.519> then<00:03:17.609> you've<00:03:17.700> got

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
poking in this way and then you've got

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.759 
poking in this way and then you've got
the<00:03:17.970> manipulator<00:03:18.480> peg<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.810> way<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.530> all<00:03:19.650> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
the manipulator peg this way so all of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.199 
the manipulator peg this way so all of
the<00:03:19.859> forces<00:03:20.220> going<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.579> way<00:03:20.760> which<00:03:20.940> just

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the forces going that way which just

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.849 
the forces going that way which just
causes<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.840> collapse<00:03:22.109> inside

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
causes it to collapse inside

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.800 
causes it to collapse inside
now<00:03:23.340> I've<00:03:23.459> just<00:03:23.669> offset<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.209> by<00:03:24.269> having<00:03:24.690> him

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
now I've just offset that by having him

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.050 
now I've just offset that by having him
support<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.620> his<00:03:25.859> left<00:03:26.549> arm

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
support it with his left arm

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.470 
support it with his left arm
this<00:03:27.419> giant<00:03:27.989> stand<00:03:28.680> which<00:03:29.669> takes<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.329> just

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
this giant stand which takes if you just

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.210 
this giant stand which takes if you just
look<00:03:30.629> at<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.810> from<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.169> this<00:03:31.379> when<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.829> put<00:03:32.069> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
look at it from like this when I put the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.589 
look at it from like this when I put the
camera<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.579> there<00:03:32.669> outside<00:03:32.819> of<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.120> gray<00:03:33.359> arm

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
camera in there outside of that gray arm

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.580 
camera in there outside of that gray arm
it<00:03:33.810> looks<00:03:33.989> pretty<00:03:34.169> good

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
it looks pretty good

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
it looks pretty good
but<00:03:35.010> as<00:03:35.129> soon<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.459> come<00:03:35.639> back<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
but as soon as you come back and you

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.550 
but as soon as you come back and you
looked<00:03:36.209> at<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.359> like<00:03:36.629> that<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:36.870> your<00:03:37.109> shelf<00:03:37.349> it

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
looked at it like that on your shelf it

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.229 
looked at it like that on your shelf it
would<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.859> be<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.069> hey<00:03:38.730> there's<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.060> big

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
would just be like hey there's a big

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.460 
would just be like hey there's a big
stand<00:03:39.510> that's<00:03:39.720> either<00:03:39.930> giving<00:03:40.200> him<00:03:40.319> power

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
stand that's either giving him power

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.129 
stand that's either giving him power
from<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.859> ground<00:03:41.129> but<00:03:41.849> otherwise<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.569> wouldn't

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
from the ground but otherwise I wouldn't

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.129 
from the ground but otherwise I wouldn't
say<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.319> looks<00:03:43.530> all<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.859> cool<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.870> little<00:03:45.870> more

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
say it looks all that cool a little more

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.720 
say it looks all that cool a little more

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
shoulder all the way up I was actually

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.699 
shoulder all the way up I was actually
able<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.519> do<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.199> without<00:04:01.199> too<00:04:01.590> much

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
able to do this without too much

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.339 
able to do this without too much
difficulty<00:04:05.449> with<00:04:06.449> the<00:04:06.599> sword<00:04:06.810> pose<00:04:06.989> as<00:04:07.199> though

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
difficulty with the sword pose as though

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.720 
difficulty with the sword pose as though
that<00:04:07.590> you'll<00:04:07.709> notice<00:04:07.949> that<00:04:08.069> this<00:04:08.220> thing<00:04:08.459> falls

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
that you'll notice that this thing falls

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.659 
that you'll notice that this thing falls
off<00:04:08.970> at<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.269> drop<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.690> hat<00:04:10.280> with<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.400> kind

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
off at the drop of a hat with this kind

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.069 
off at the drop of a hat with this kind
of<00:04:11.760> pose<00:04:11.910> you've<00:04:12.120> got<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.449> stand<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:12.989> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
of pose you've got the stand on the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.689 
of pose you've got the stand on the
other<00:04:13.109> side<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.889> of<00:04:14.010> course<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.549> as

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
other side so of course it's not as

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.420 
other side so of course it's not as
visually<00:04:15.299> obtrusive<00:04:15.829> but<00:04:16.829> again<00:04:17.070> because

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
visually obtrusive but again because

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.039 
visually obtrusive but again because
it's<00:04:17.609> sort<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.820> duplicating<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.539> position<00:04:18.959> of

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it's sort of duplicating the position of

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.800 
it's sort of duplicating the position of
the<00:04:19.139> hand<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.829> actually<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:21.090> forearm<00:04:21.419> thing

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the hand and actually this forearm thing

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.510 
the hand and actually this forearm thing
for<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.169> sword<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.560> offering<00:04:22.919> more<00:04:23.130> support

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
for the sword is offering more support

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.279 
for the sword is offering more support
though<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.210> expected<00:04:24.780> although<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.050> can

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
though that I expected although you can

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.379 
though that I expected although you can
see<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.740> detaches<00:04:26.099> itself<00:04:26.340> there

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
see that it detaches itself there

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.300 
see that it detaches itself there
but<00:04:28.139> because<00:04:28.409> those<00:04:28.560> two<00:04:28.770> things<00:04:28.800> are<00:04:29.129> in<00:04:29.219> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
but because those two things are in the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.800 
but because those two things are in the
same<00:04:29.490> position<00:04:29.669> it's<00:04:30.060> not<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.509> master

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
same position it's not like the master

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.179 
same position it's not like the master
grade<00:04:30.960> red<00:04:31.169> frame<00:04:31.439> where<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.650> sort<00:04:31.919> of<00:04:31.979> have

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189 
grade red frame where you sort of have

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.520 
grade red frame where you sort of have
two<00:04:32.490> different<00:04:32.909> points<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.539> holding

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
two different points of holding

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.050 
two different points of holding
everything<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:35.009> you<00:04:35.129> just<00:04:35.340> seem<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.610> have<00:04:35.729> one

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
everything in you just seem to have one

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.360 
everything in you just seem to have one
point<00:04:36.419> in<00:04:36.719> the<00:04:37.379> same<00:04:37.590> position<00:04:38.069> but<00:04:38.279> then

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
point in the same position but then

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.159 
point in the same position but then
again<00:04:38.639> with<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> little<00:04:39.509> bit<00:04:39.599> of<00:04:39.689> patience<00:04:40.050> you

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
again with a little bit of patience you

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.820 
again with a little bit of patience you
can<00:04:40.409> get<00:04:40.710> him<00:04:41.270> here<00:04:42.270> with<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.050> massive<00:04:43.590> sword

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
can get him here with that massive sword

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.580 
can get him here with that massive sword
out<00:04:44.270> but<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.360> backpack<00:04:45.749> attached<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.469> the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
out but the backpack attached and the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.219 
out but the backpack attached and the
light<00:04:46.919> glowing<00:04:47.789> in<00:04:47.909> the<00:04:47.939> engine<00:04:48.360> there<00:04:48.539> you'll

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
light glowing in the engine there you'll

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.480 
light glowing in the engine there you'll
see<00:04:49.439> that<00:04:49.469> it<00:04:49.650> comes<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.949> across<00:04:50.249> pretty

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
see that it comes to across pretty

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.830 
see that it comes to across pretty
brightly<00:04:50.999> through<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> lens<00:04:51.569> of<00:04:51.749> the<00:04:51.810> camera

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
brightly through the lens of the camera

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.769 
brightly through the lens of the camera
but<00:04:52.710> in<00:04:52.800> reality<00:04:53.009> I<00:04:53.639> don't<00:04:54.060> find<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.689> be

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:54.779 
but in reality I don't find it to be

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.119 
but in reality I don't find it to be
very<00:04:54.990> bright<00:04:55.259> and<00:04:55.469> I<00:04:55.529> don't<00:04:55.710> think<00:04:55.889> that<00:04:56.009> it's

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
very bright and I don't think that it's

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.659 
very bright and I don't think that it's
going<00:04:56.219> to<00:04:56.310> shine<00:04:56.550> through<00:04:56.909> on<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.779> shield

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
going to shine through on the shield

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.219 
going to shine through on the shield

on the inside and those black that

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.589 
on the inside and those black that

spread out pixels as you look right
through<00:05:22.080> there<00:05:22.289> so<00:05:22.889> again<00:05:23.099> I'm<00:05:23.250> going<00:05:23.370> to

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
through there so again I'm going to

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.010 
through there so again I'm going to
probably<00:05:23.639> take<00:05:24.060> off<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.449> seal<00:05:24.779> on<00:05:24.930> the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
probably take off that seal on the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.600 
probably take off that seal on the
inside<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.469> see<00:05:25.620> how<00:05:25.770> bright<00:05:26.039> that<00:05:26.310> can<00:05:26.460> be

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
inside and see how bright that can be

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.969 
inside and see how bright that can be
otherwise<00:05:26.939> later<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.539> though<00:05:28.499> I<00:05:28.529> complain

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
otherwise later and though I complain

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.100 
otherwise later and though I complain
about<00:05:29.009> the<00:05:29.339> lack<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.550> brightness<00:05:30.300> when<00:05:31.020> you

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
about the lack of brightness when you

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.719 
about the lack of brightness when you
actually<00:05:31.229> see<00:05:31.500> this<00:05:31.620> in<00:05:31.800> person<00:05:32.039> by<00:05:32.279> yourself

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
actually see this in person by yourself

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.939 
actually see this in person by yourself
you'll<00:05:33.300> actually<00:05:33.479> be<00:05:33.659> impressed<00:05:34.139> at<00:05:34.319> how<00:05:34.469> deep

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
you'll actually be impressed at how deep

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.119 
you'll actually be impressed at how deep
it<00:05:35.219> seems<00:05:35.759> that<00:05:35.939> you<00:05:36.060> can<00:05:36.240> see<00:05:36.479> inside<00:05:37.229> the

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
it seems that you can see inside the

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.309 
it seems that you can see inside the
gundam<00:05:38.460> with<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.599> twin<00:05:39.810> drives<00:05:40.080> that<00:05:40.259> are

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
gundam with the twin drives that are

gundam with the twin drives that are
working<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.830> back<00:05:40.979> and<00:05:41.159> remember<00:05:41.370> you<00:05:41.580> can

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
working in the back and remember you can

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.820 
working in the back and remember you can
swing<00:05:41.939> that<00:05:41.969> blue<00:05:42.360> part<00:05:42.629> more<00:05:42.870> open<00:05:43.289> you're

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
swing that blue part more open you're

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.260 
swing that blue part more open you're
going<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.009> have<00:05:44.099> to<00:05:44.219> bring<00:05:44.310> them<00:05:44.490> forward<00:05:44.729> to

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
going to have to bring them forward to

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.570 
going to have to bring them forward to
address<00:05:45.569> some<00:05:45.689> of<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.870> balance<00:05:46.199> issues<00:05:46.580> but

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
address some of the balance issues but

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.100 
address some of the balance issues but
it<00:05:47.759> looks<00:05:48.000> like<00:05:48.149> citizeness<00:05:48.539> about<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:48.930> take<00:05:49.080> a

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
it looks like citizeness about to take a

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.540 
it looks like citizeness about to take a
brave<00:05:49.409> step<00:05:49.770> into<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.729> future<00:05:51.089> there<00:05:52.550> with

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
brave step into the future there with

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.740 
brave step into the future there with
the<00:05:53.669> bits<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:54.000> course<00:05:54.180> you<00:05:54.300> can<00:05:54.449> turn<00:05:54.599> them

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
the bits of course you can turn them

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.689 
the bits of course you can turn them
into<00:05:54.870> blades<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:55.649> you<00:05:55.740> could<00:05:55.919> detach<00:05:56.370> these

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
into blades and you could detach these

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.700 
into blades and you could detach these
two<00:05:57.060> or<00:05:57.270> just<00:05:57.300> use<00:05:57.719> them<00:05:57.960> attached<00:05:58.439> together

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
two or just use them attached together

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.950 
two or just use them attached together
but<00:05:59.580> again<00:05:59.849> I<00:05:59.879> don't<00:06:00.060> really<00:06:00.599> want<00:06:00.779> to<00:06:00.810> go

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
but again I don't really want to go

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.719 
but again I don't really want to go
through<00:06:01.319> the<00:06:01.529> hassle<00:06:01.800> of<00:06:02.159> trying<00:06:02.339> to<00:06:02.460> pop

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
through the hassle of trying to pop

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.700 
through the hassle of trying to pop
these<00:06:02.939> off<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.539> hoping<00:06:04.259> that<00:06:04.349> everything

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
these off and hoping that everything

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.670 
these off and hoping that everything
stays<00:06:05.009> together<00:06:05.250> when<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.639> do<00:06:05.759> so<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.680> bits

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
stays together when I do so the bits

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.959 
stays together when I do so the bits
themselves<00:06:08.219> if<00:06:08.310> you<00:06:08.399> want<00:06:08.550> to<00:06:08.610> use<00:06:08.699> them<00:06:08.849> as

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
themselves if you want to use them as

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.639 
themselves if you want to use them as
blades<00:06:09.330> fit<00:06:09.539> into<00:06:09.689> the<00:06:09.839> hands<00:06:10.050> very<00:06:10.289> well<00:06:10.500> the

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:10.649 
blades fit into the hands very well the

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.320 
blades fit into the hands very well the
manipulator<00:06:11.099> is<00:06:11.189> a<00:06:11.279> bit<00:06:11.430> solid<00:06:11.699> putting<00:06:12.149> it<00:06:12.240> on

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
manipulator is a bit solid putting it on

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.850 
manipulator is a bit solid putting it on
but<00:06:12.870> again<00:06:13.080> that's<00:06:13.259> going<00:06:13.379> to<00:06:13.439> help<00:06:13.529> it<00:06:13.710> stay

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
but again that's going to help it stay

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.860 
but again that's going to help it stay
in<00:06:13.889> place<00:06:14.159> and<00:06:14.399> you<00:06:14.819> can<00:06:14.969> pop<00:06:15.149> the<00:06:15.300> hands<00:06:15.779> and

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
in place and you can pop the hands and

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.079 
in place and you can pop the hands and
the<00:06:15.960> manipulators<00:06:16.500> off<00:06:16.649> very<00:06:16.919> easily<00:06:17.089> rather

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
the manipulators off very easily rather

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:19.550 
the manipulators off very easily rather
than<00:06:18.330> dealing<00:06:18.539> with<00:06:18.689> putting<00:06:18.960> them<00:06:19.139> on<00:06:19.289> and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
than dealing with putting them on and
