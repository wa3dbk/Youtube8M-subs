00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.070 
that's probably my favorite brushes so
that's<00:02:44.580> why<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> wanted<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.300> little<00:02:45.600> set<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that's why I wanted this little set and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.140 
that's why I wanted this little set and
then<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> third<00:02:47.130> brush<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.640> comes<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.970> here

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
then the third brush that comes in here

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.600 
then the third brush that comes in here
is<00:02:48.330> an<00:02:48.510> angled<00:02:48.870> eyeliner<00:02:49.050> brush<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.010> an

angled<00:02:51.090> sponge<00:02:51.570> tip<00:02:52.019> brush<00:02:52.380> which<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.769> thought

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
angled sponge tip brush which I thought

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.259 
angled sponge tip brush which I thought
was<00:02:53.010> kind<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.280> weird<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.760> different<00:02:53.940> like

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
was kind of weird and different like

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.810 
was kind of weird and different like

think maybe I'd wear them with like a

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.270 
think maybe I'd wear them with like a
baggy<00:06:24.380> t-shirt<00:06:25.380> over<00:06:25.590> it<00:06:25.920> or<00:06:26.040> maybe<00:06:26.160> a

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
baggy t-shirt over it or maybe a

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.340 
baggy t-shirt over it or maybe a
tucked-in<00:06:26.760> tank<00:06:27.090> top<00:06:27.270> and<00:06:27.390> a<00:06:27.450> sweater<00:06:27.600> so
