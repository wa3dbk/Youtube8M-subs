00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.810
 minecraft video to the channel and we're 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.220
 playing again pixel 20 be seen in this 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.220
 mini game that you both like and 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.260
 that I love so much and we're going to 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.869
 see what we have to draw today 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.349
 we have to draw a picnic to see 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:25.249
 grab the pencil the pencil 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:29.690
 game has helped him see picnic I was 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:31.790
 it happens I do not know how to draw a bit of grass 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.620
 perhaps this green cited does a 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.740
 little bit darker to give it like that 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.840
 the flange 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.980
 and although we were going to close this other 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.980
 small side 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 to see what we were going to but good as 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.120
 we are here with the tree we are going to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.059
 draw a tree I do not know to give it background 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.170
 to the picnic to the scene and a little bit of 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.269
 this coffee color for the trick ok 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.140
 now we begin to fill perhaps with 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.930
 this green let's see how it looks 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.460
 too dark to see this other one here 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.530
 too bright to see is another one here 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.080
 or good and this one that stays this is the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 let me see what we are going to put this 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.770
 from here and ready now 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.829
 let's grab this color and with the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.969
 pencil let's start drawing a 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.450
 small picnic basket where it would be 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.770
 well here maybe 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.289
 okay 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.329
 these parts above to see this is the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.640
 part of above and if they do not find it 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.350
 still do not worry because 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.360
 then it is maybe they do it to see 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.710
 here we go up and close the basket 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.180
 perfect now we have it now let's 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.080
 Fill it with this little color 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 and we are going to shape it but that perfect 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.360
 and it seems like a thing that is not looking 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.060
 the mutant picnic we are going to put the bottom 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.290
 so that you see a little bit of each other 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.390
 have something inside that has 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.690
 depth that looks open 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.520
 the basket ok oops pass me there a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.400
 milestone pixel nothing happens to see now 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.610
 let's start with the mount crime of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.310
 typical tablecloth that always goes down in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 pic nic the white tablecloth with squares 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.810
 red the usual colors 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.640
 we have two minutes left and we're going to 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.010
 fill with white let's do 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.090
 little red sexy squares 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.090
 then this red 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.520
 too dark too dark go 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.140
 to put this red or perfect perfect and 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.790
 now let's start drawing pictures 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.860
 and then I'm going to fill them in and I'm going to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.760
 draw one by one I say instead of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.920
 draw them 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.760
 one around here another one here and another one 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.319
 here are not pictures but they are me you already know 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.189
 drawings made in the style of paint 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.360
 although squares here and square by 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.920
 here 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.070
 and over here now let's fill them 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.030
 here and this is not if this one if this one 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.530
 If this latter if it if it if you 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.120
 we already have our tablecloth and 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.650
 let's draw a few ants 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 because I think I 'm running out 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.010
 I only have a minute left if 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.990
 it is a minute we'll see goodbye 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.390
 to put some ants there like that 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.190
 they are already putting the basket 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.440
 ants that always bother us in the 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.390
 picnics in our family ok 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.970
 now let's draw a person like that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.380
 fast because it is no longer 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.989
 and also there can not be a picnic if there is not 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.480
 obviously we are going to continue with 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.220
 the pencil cited a bit of how bad we 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.500
 was the head and we are going to put a 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.180
 little hair thought in a cap 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.440
 but it does not give us time for so many 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.340
 details so we improve with the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.190
 hair and more or less now the body 20 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.630
 seconds not ok ok yes yes yes we finish the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.570
 body the body that is thus all dry 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.860
 it does not matter to see the knees legs what 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.140
 to be 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.450
 if it is clear what we are going to 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.830
 fill with this color if it is a 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.830
 little bit lighter one or ten seconds 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.620
 do not worry do not worry, do not worry 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.960
 worry 321 and that's where my 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.150
 drawing yes I ended up I came in the 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.980
 last moment and it was time for the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.110
 vote click on your favorite drawing 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.420
 and let's see what other people have drawn 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.000
 users and vote those that have been 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.540
 best so far we have here 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.560
 a picnic and we have here I go by 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.380
 this one because drawing there are the little people the 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.710
 fruit the basket you know very pretty 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.420
 to see now we have a similar drawing 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.420
 to mine at the bottom but I think 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.270
 I'm going for this rose sunshine sin 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.150
 because it's a picnic no fruits left 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.210
 picnic no desserts no fruits or no tie 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:09.160
 or that no longer rose online yes ok by 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.780
 decision of the game now comes my drawing 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.300
