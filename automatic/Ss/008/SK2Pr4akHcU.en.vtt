Challenge but in between we we run a
speech<00:00:24.779> Ambu<00:00:25.170> ship<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.130> combination

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
speech Ambu ship which is a combination

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
speech Ambu ship which is a combination
of<00:00:26.910> hill<00:00:27.119> climbs<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.960> sprints<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of hill climbs and sprints and it is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.120 
of hill climbs and sprints and it is
very<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:29.699> competitive<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.890> car

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
very very competitive but it's one car

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
very very competitive but it's one car
at<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> time<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.180> from<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
at a time and from there we have the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 
at a time and from there we have the
Porsche<00:00:35.040> Club<00:00:35.219> Championship<00:00:35.850> which<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.600> for

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
Porsche Club Championship which is for

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.139 
Porsche Club Championship which is for
production-based<00:00:37.559> cars<00:00:37.760> we<00:00:38.760> run<00:00:38.940> different

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
production-based cars we run different

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
production-based cars we run different
weights<00:00:39.600> depending<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> model<00:00:41.070> year<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
weights depending on the model year of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
weights depending on the model year of
the<00:00:41.550> car<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.420> specification<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> car

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the car and the specification of the car

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.650 
the car and the specification of the car
so<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.100> helps<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> balance<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.000> performance

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
so that helps to balance the performance

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.389 
so that helps to balance the performance
and<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> idea<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> provide<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> level

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and the idea is to provide a level

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.700 
and the idea is to provide a level
playing<00:00:47.520> field<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> variety<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.500> different

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
playing field for a variety of different

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.700 
playing field for a variety of different
model<00:00:50.039> years<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> car<00:00:50.690> where<00:00:51.690> competitors<00:00:52.500> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
model years of car where competitors can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
model years of car where competitors can
come<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> race<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.120> high-performance

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
come out and race in high-performance

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.220 
come out and race in high-performance
high<00:00:55.350> speed<00:00:55.649> Porsche<00:00:56.579> race<00:00:56.820> cars<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
high speed Porsche race cars but with a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.920 
high speed Porsche race cars but with a
level<00:00:58.530> plane

the gt3 Cup challenges is a series

the gt3 Cup challenges is a series
that's<00:01:08.170> run<00:01:08.410> by<00:01:08.440> Porsche<00:01:09.370> Club

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
that's run by Porsche Club

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.710 
that's run by Porsche Club
but<00:01:10.810> it's<00:01:10.960> underpinned<00:01:11.440> by<00:01:11.500> Porsche<00:01:12.040> cars<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
but it's underpinned by Porsche cars so

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.690 
but it's underpinned by Porsche cars so
it's<00:01:14.170> got<00:01:14.380> all<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.800> support<00:01:15.190> of<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.550> of

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
it's got all of the support of the of

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.300 
it's got all of the support of the of
the<00:01:15.820> manufacturer<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:17.290> was<00:01:17.470> where<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.740> started

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
the manufacturer it was where I started

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.730 
the manufacturer it was where I started
racing<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.480> I've<00:01:19.660> started<00:01:19.870> racing<00:01:20.260> in<00:01:20.470> very

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
racing so I've started racing in very

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.340 
racing so I've started racing in very
late<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.100> life<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.150> really<00:01:23.140> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
late in life but it's it's really the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.390 
late in life but it's it's really the
higher<00:01:23.560> end<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.660> club<00:01:25.660> motorsport<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:26.980> not<00:01:27.220> a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
higher end of club motorsport it's not a

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400 
higher end of club motorsport it's not a
area<00:01:28.030> where<00:01:28.300> typically<00:01:28.780> they<00:01:29.050> too<00:01:29.230> much

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
area where typically they too much

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.500 
area where typically they too much
sponsorship<00:01:30.010> certainly<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.400> my<00:01:30.550> case<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:31.090> fund

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
sponsorship certainly in my case I fund

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.470 
sponsorship certainly in my case I fund
the<00:01:31.660> racing<00:01:32.260> myself<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:33.760> accessible

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
the racing myself so it is accessible

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.710 
the racing myself so it is accessible
and<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:36.280> covers<00:01:36.610> all<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.210> range<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
and it covers all of the range of the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.530 
and it covers all of the range of the
earlier<00:01:38.050> 997<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.040> 906<00:01:39.490> Cup<00:01:39.790> cars

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.870 

the<00:01:44.540> idea<00:01:44.930> is<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:45.140> we<00:01:45.259> contain<00:01:45.710> costs<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.850> a

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the idea is that we contain costs for a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.120 
the idea is that we contain costs for a
lot<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.060> our<00:01:47.270> competitors<00:01:47.619> time<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> big

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
lot of our competitors time is a big

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.280 
lot of our competitors time is a big
issue<00:01:49.159> for<00:01:49.520> them<00:01:49.640> not<00:01:49.970> necessarily<00:01:50.090> money<00:01:50.690> but

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
issue for them not necessarily money but

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.469 
issue for them not necessarily money but
but<00:01:51.500> time<00:01:51.770> by<00:01:52.130> running<00:01:52.369> shorter<00:01:53.299> race

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but time by running shorter race

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.840 
but time by running shorter race
meetings<00:01:54.020> maybe<00:01:54.440> even<00:01:55.100> one<00:01:55.250> day<00:01:55.280> meetings

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
meetings maybe even one day meetings

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.990 
meetings maybe even one day meetings
then<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.259> drivers<00:01:57.740> required<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.549> invest<00:01:58.850> less

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
then the drivers required to invest less

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.180 
then the drivers required to invest less
time<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.600> it's<00:02:00.259> easier<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.710> fit<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.040> with

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
time and it's easier to fit in with

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.219 
time and it's easier to fit in with
their<00:02:01.310> business<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.909> family<00:02:02.149> life<00:02:02.479> as<00:02:03.140> a
