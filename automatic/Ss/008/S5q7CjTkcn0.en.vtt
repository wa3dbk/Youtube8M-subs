geography<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.210> Washington<00:01:14.960> State<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:15.380> much

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
geography of Washington State so much

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.070

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.179 
see it this is a great experience I
think<00:01:31.700> that<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.690> like<00:01:34.179> remember

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
think that I like remember

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.510 
think that I like remember
with<00:01:36.820> probably<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.469> hiking<00:01:38.710> now<00:01:39.159> for<00:01:39.399> you

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
with probably all the hiking now for you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.880 
with probably all the hiking now for you
as<00:01:40.359> they<00:01:40.569> grow<00:01:40.810> up<00:01:40.840> hopefully<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.619> will<00:01:41.679> build

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
as they grow up hopefully it will build

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.389 
as they grow up hopefully it will build
on<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.249> knowledge<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.929> be<00:01:43.929> able<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
on that knowledge and be able to to

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.539 
on that knowledge and be able to to
really<00:01:45.700> contribute<00:01:46.179> to<00:01:47.250> decisions<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.429> are

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
really contribute to decisions that are

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.520 
really contribute to decisions that are
made<00:01:48.579> about<00:01:48.729> public<00:01:49.270> lands<00:01:49.659> or<00:01:49.899> how<00:01:50.319> they

made about public lands or how they

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.199 
made about public lands or how they
decide<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.920> live<00:01:51.280> their<00:01:51.459> life<00:01:51.579> in<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.880> future

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.660 
decide to live their life in the future
in<00:01:52.600> terms<00:01:52.689> of<00:01:52.959> how<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.289> might<00:01:53.469> affect<00:01:53.770> places

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
in terms of how that might affect places

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.999 
in terms of how that might affect places
like<00:01:54.819> in<00:01:55.000> North<00:01:55.179> Cascades<00:01:55.630> or<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.709> wild

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
like in North Cascades or the wild

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.330 
like in North Cascades or the wild
places<00:01:57.189> in<00:01:57.459> their<00:01:57.609> own<00:01:57.729> backyard<00:01:58.509> just<00:01:59.340> after

microscopes and hand lenses at leaves

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.600 
microscopes and hand lenses at leaves
and<00:02:06.969> it's<00:02:07.209> blown<00:02:07.689> away<00:02:07.929> by<00:02:08.229> what<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.340> find

ecosystems that this place has to offer

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890 
ecosystems that this place has to offer

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.729 
using their claws to get some of the
insects<00:02:31.629> out<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.930> middle<00:02:32.200> they're<00:02:32.650> gonna

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
insects out of the middle they're gonna

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.400 
insects out of the middle they're gonna
come<00:02:33.489> back<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.359> lot<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.780> knowledge<00:02:35.109> from

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
come back with a lot of knowledge from

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.069 
come back with a lot of knowledge from
just<00:02:35.739> being<00:02:35.980> hands-on<00:02:36.489> here<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.810> this

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
just being hands-on here in this

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.599 
just being hands-on here in this
experience<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.220> thing<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.519> I've

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
experience it's the one thing that I've

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.979 
experience it's the one thing that I've
seen<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.819> most<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.209> they've<00:02:40.450> taken<00:02:40.480> so

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
seen the most is that they've taken so

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.319 
seen the most is that they've taken so
much<00:02:41.139> knowledge<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:42.280> we've<00:02:42.459> been<00:02:43.090> learning

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
much knowledge that we've been learning

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.780 
much knowledge that we've been learning
in<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> classroom<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.530> applying<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.519> gear

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
in the classroom and applying that gear

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.520 
in the classroom and applying that gear
I'm<00:02:45.880> amazed<00:02:46.180> how<00:02:46.630> much<00:02:46.780> they're<00:02:47.049> taking<00:02:47.440> in

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
I'm amazed how much they're taking in

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.110 
I'm amazed how much they're taking in
connecting<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.670> mountain<00:02:48.940> school

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
connecting the mountain school

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.270 
connecting the mountain school
experience<00:02:49.540> was<00:02:49.810> definitely<00:02:50.650> more<00:02:51.069> than<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
experience was definitely more than I

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.849 
experience was definitely more than I
expected<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.120> think<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:53.230> students<00:02:53.650> didn't

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
expected I think the students didn't

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.319 
expected I think the students didn't
just<00:02:54.040> learn<00:02:54.220> about<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.639> environment<00:02:55.150> but

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
just learn about the environment but

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.000 
just learn about the environment but
they<00:02:55.900> learned<00:02:56.109> also<00:02:56.290> about<00:02:56.470> working<00:02:56.739> together

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
they learned also about working together

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.430 
they learned also about working together
as<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.370> group<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:57.910> they<00:02:58.660> came<00:02:58.840> back<00:02:59.049> with<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.260> lot

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
as a group and they came back with a lot

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.659 
as a group and they came back with a lot
more<00:02:59.590> than<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.859> really<00:03:00.130> thought<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.430> they

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
more than I really thought that they

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.490 
more than I really thought that they
would<00:03:00.910> learn<00:03:01.690> about

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
would learn about

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.020 
would learn about
in

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
in

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.020 
in
about<00:03:06.030> tracks<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.260> how<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.760> and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
about tracks and how to see what and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.259 
about tracks and how to see what and
when<00:03:09.450> we<00:03:09.599> were<00:03:09.900> there<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.790> don't<00:03:11.790> think<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.209> was

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
when we were there I don't think it was

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:12.979 
when we were there I don't think it was
worth<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.599> effort

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
worth the effort

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.839 
worth the effort
my<00:03:13.260> first<00:03:13.739> motivation<00:03:13.980> really<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.819> I

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
my first motivation really is that I

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.759 
my first motivation really is that I
love<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.629> in<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> outdoors<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
love to be in the outdoors and I like to

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.170 
love to be in the outdoors and I like to
share<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.069> with<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.310> students<00:03:17.760> but<00:03:17.879> also<00:03:18.030> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
share that with my students but also I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.729 
share that with my students but also I
think<00:03:18.300> it's<00:03:18.540> important<00:03:19.050> for<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.290> kids<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.709> be

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
think it's important for the kids to be

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.400 
think it's important for the kids to be
aware<00:03:20.099> of<00:03:20.250> their<00:03:20.459> environment<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:22.140> lot<00:03:22.380> of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
aware of their environment and a lot of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.990 
aware of their environment and a lot of
my<00:03:22.860> students<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.310> never<00:03:23.430> been<00:03:23.670> up<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
my students have never been up to the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300 
my students have never been up to the
North<00:03:24.180> Cascades<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.860> much<00:03:26.010> fun<00:03:26.250> to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
North Cascades it's just so much fun to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.050 
North Cascades it's just so much fun to
the<00:03:26.489> outside<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.530> get<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.800> experience<00:03:29.640> touch

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
the outside and get to experience touch

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.809 
the outside and get to experience touch
I<00:03:30.660> know<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.380> lot<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.680> them<00:03:31.769> are<00:03:31.920> more<00:03:32.160> aware<00:03:32.790> of

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
I know a lot of them are more aware of

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.089 
I know a lot of them are more aware of
throwing<00:03:33.360> away<00:03:33.540> trash<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.349> being<00:03:34.860> aware<00:03:35.040> of

picking up trash outside and where it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.809 
picking up trash outside and where it
goes<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.849> hope<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.420> they<00:03:39.810> will<00:03:40.580> gain<00:03:41.580> an

North Cascades of Washington State gain
an<00:03:51.660> understanding<00:03:52.349> of<00:03:53.040> how<00:03:53.459> interconnected
