00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.600
 us wednesday evening we have warming again 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.110
 this time plus 8 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.740
 spring spring spring and today we are talking about 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.630
 such a topic as her work 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.590
 foreigners channel that is those people 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.680
 which are actually 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.480
 are not indigenous people those 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.480
 who are not born channel seems 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.989
 more precisely to be a question which are rented 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.989
 so that how difficult is not difficult 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.870
 get to work at the end 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.590
 university teacher how much 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.940
 what kind of lead is required 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.220
 learning retraining to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 get to work well i actually 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.750
 I want to answer it more widely 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.449
 because about work 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.500
 teachers I already did a video here 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:05.590
 about hiring she worked those who didn't 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.140
 born obviously casual in my but 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.630
 nothing concrete then the door is small 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.790
 did not make the video 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.850
 and so I want to actually do it now 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 The question is essentially about 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.940
 hiring 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 hiring foreigners as 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.600
 turning university in quebec 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.660
 specifically I can say it is big 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.270
 problem in the tank is very difficult to get on 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.910
 jobs for people who are not defined here 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.729
 and especially those who have not finished the place 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.130
 do not wait as the author of the issue of justice 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.860
 of our noticed in order to get on 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.560
 a high school job a person should 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.180
 retrained in essence because the thing from 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.740
 talk about the situation in the form because 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.540
 situation could background canada she 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.930
 different for the better 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.060
 and if we are talking about quebec then in 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:07.040
 penny you must be a member of the order 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.640
 as through divine canada however in 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.640
 Unlike 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.000
 Angles he and Canada here 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.250
 there is such 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.960
 body yes agency which 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.680
 are under the Ministry of Migration 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.050
 which follow the topic as far as 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 number of physiological courses you have 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.390
 correspond to a periodic course in 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.550
 universities of canada respectively 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.500
 compares after that say wait a minute 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.380
 don't suit yourself 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.600
 Pumpkin as a rule of people who have 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.550
 who did not finish pedagogical 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.590
 institutes and graduated from this university 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.560
 on a specialty teacher in something 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.800
 there to buy them and wrap it that 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.550
 concerns secondary schools as far as 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.560
 university in that situation here 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.290
 much better you don't need to relearn 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.510
 you do not need to receive any banks 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.370
 crusts of education in order to 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.239
 work as being taught in 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.850
 university or college however like me 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.510
 already said dogs exist brightly 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.510
 pronounced 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.110
 pronounced protectionism of their own 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.300
 born here and if you are not 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.830
 so that is very unique specialists 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.390
 most likely you will have problems with 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.519
 job search as a sell and 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.370
 because there are separate 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.560
 there are three teachers contests 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.019
 works on a temporary contract and order 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.769
 almost no way to get on 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 positions that are permanent there 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.720
 there is a queue for seniority 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.000
 work experience separately there people 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.130
 consider and so on although there is 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.079
 the president and so I recently met 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.959
 the girl who graduated from the east 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.390
 faculty and which after a few 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.000
 months and rates she came to canada 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.720
 was built of course teacher in 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.180
 kikom university 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.340
 and got no follower of autocity 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.520
 a full -time professor but this and 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.810
 lucky and happy because the enemy 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.790
 turned out to be places where you would know 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.350
 chinese wait and chinese she 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.390
 will agree finished Chinese store 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.329
 chinese language and put by china 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.799
 so not everything went well 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.430
 now more widely what did he say 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.090
 question about what reception is back in 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.460
 to work waivers not waiver on this 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.790
 about the cockpit yes there is such a problem 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.590
 what if you were not born here and not 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.380
 turned out education if you do not 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.170
 speak backward in native yes for 300 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.790
 with each if if your chances for 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.570
 getting to work inflicting less less 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.820
 provided that there is a clear 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.770
 a candidate who to a great extent can 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.720
 do all the same work 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.120
 that is to say roughly twist when 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.330
 other things equal if there are local there are you 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.450
 then choose a place like this let's say 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.790
 the situation is typical for whom beta 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.900
 but it is completely unacceptable 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.650
 for english speaking canada and actually 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.900
 if you lie down 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.120
 have the necessary skills for 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.000
 road do some work in this 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.230
 work will get you will not refuse and problems 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.720
 about it 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.580
 so actually when you come to 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.890
 escape if you come to a dead end if you 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.240
 aim work in a rough whale way to 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:28.850
 this is ready that everything is well paid 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.620
 works they will first be endorsed 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.590
 be reserved for 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.380
 for local and all of us are all foreigners 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.840
 more precisely on the strange born Canadians they 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.760
 all will be considered as 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.720
 separate second category they like 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.080
 first category 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.060
 and accordingly there may be all sorts of 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.220
 different offense problems then whether 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.800
 that here it would seem you are beautiful 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.970
 candidates in all respects fit but 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.940
 no chose there for some kind of depression 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.419
 there or even you will not correct 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.389
 and yes this problem is a problem to not necessary 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.120
 be ready so here's such 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.289
 story 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.419
 I hope I answered the question 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:18.570
 and clarified the priority situation when 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.550
 looking for a job once again stressed that 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.220
 anglo backgrounds k started another there more 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.150
 evaluated here because as 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:29.370
 specialist not because born somewhere 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.620
 examples of that mass of me all my friends 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.300
 on this end video I wish you all 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.919
 very good and let you all 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.919
 work out how you want a meeting
