00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.059 

roni<00:00:03.220> satisfy<00:00:03.850> that<00:00:04.150> one<00:00:04.560> yes<00:00:05.560> I'm<00:00:05.860> satisfied

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
roni satisfy that one yes I'm satisfied

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:08.250 
roni satisfy that one yes I'm satisfied
very<00:00:06.399> much<00:00:06.729> I<00:00:06.880> think<00:00:07.090> we<00:00:07.210> and<00:00:07.689> the<00:00:07.750> first<00:00:07.990> half

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
very much I think we and the first half

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.470 
very much I think we and the first half
was<00:00:09.010> very<00:00:09.250> good<00:00:09.430> in<00:00:09.550> the<00:00:09.610> defense<00:00:10.000> nothing

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
was very good in the defense nothing

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.230 
was very good in the defense nothing
happened<00:00:10.810> but<00:00:11.770> in<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.490> offense<00:00:12.790> I<00:00:12.940> think<00:00:13.180> you

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
happened but in the offense I think you

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.940 
happened but in the offense I think you
go<00:00:13.390> too<00:00:13.450> slow<00:00:13.600> when<00:00:13.960> we<00:00:14.080> play<00:00:14.230> it<00:00:14.350> too<00:00:14.620> much

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
go too slow when we play it too much

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.340 
go too slow when we play it too much
sideways<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.570> in<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:16.750> second<00:00:17.080> half<00:00:17.170> will<00:00:17.320> be

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
sideways so in the second half will be

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.239 
sideways so in the second half will be
more<00:00:17.680> going<00:00:18.369> forward<00:00:18.609> penetrated<00:00:19.419> more<00:00:19.539> runs

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:20.249 
more going forward penetrated more runs

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.150 
more going forward penetrated more runs
and<00:00:21.249> passes<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:22.300> then<00:00:22.480> we<00:00:23.259> opened<00:00:23.589> them<00:00:23.679> and<00:00:23.829> I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
and passes and then we opened them and I

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.519 
and passes and then we opened them and I
get<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.339> lot<00:00:24.550> of<00:00:24.609> chances<00:00:25.060> so<00:00:26.019> the<00:00:26.230> performance

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
get a lot of chances so the performance

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.099 
get a lot of chances so the performance
I<00:00:27.039> don't<00:00:27.789> think<00:00:27.970> they<00:00:28.089> had<00:00:28.210> even<00:00:28.570> one<00:00:28.929> chance

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
I don't think they had even one chance

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.000 
I don't think they had even one chance
so<00:00:29.529> that's<00:00:29.710> that's<00:00:30.189> also<00:00:30.550> very<00:00:30.579> good<00:00:30.999> but<00:00:32.010> we

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
so that's that's also very good but we

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.410 
so that's that's also very good but we
should<00:00:33.040> have<00:00:33.280> more<00:00:33.430> goals<00:00:33.670> but<00:00:34.060> the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
should have more goals but the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.970 
should have more goals but the
performance<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:34.930> good<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.829> seemed

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
performance is good it seemed

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.920 
performance is good it seemed
frustrating<00:00:36.609> at<00:00:36.730> times<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.239> way<00:00:37.329> chaos<00:00:37.660> at

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
frustrating at times the way chaos at

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.930 
frustrating at times the way chaos at
back<00:00:38.230> but<00:00:38.590> I'd<00:00:38.890> imagine<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:39.309> expected<00:00:39.789> that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
back but I'd imagine you expected that

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.680 
back but I'd imagine you expected that
from<00:00:39.969> the<00:00:40.210> opposition

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
from the opposition

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.779 
from the opposition
yeah<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.410> was<00:00:41.590> better<00:00:41.769> than<00:00:42.039> sit<00:00:42.280> back<00:00:42.489> down<00:00:42.670> at

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
yeah it was better than sit back down at

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.479 
yeah it was better than sit back down at
the<00:00:42.820> attackers<00:00:43.269> all<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.480> time<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:45.219> have<00:00:45.340> to

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
the attackers all the time so we have to

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.790 
the attackers all the time so we have to
learn<00:00:45.789> this<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.989> players<00:00:47.230> have<00:00:47.469> been<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
learn this and the players have been to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.560 
learn this and the players have been to
these<00:00:47.949> seminars<00:00:48.219> in<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> Scottish<00:00:49.269> league<00:00:49.420> as

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
these seminars in the Scottish league as

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.169 
these seminars in the Scottish league as
well<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.960> think<00:00:50.530> we<00:00:50.800> were<00:00:50.890> patient<00:00:51.160> I<00:00:51.609> think<00:00:52.090> it

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
well I think we were patient I think it

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.810 
well I think we were patient I think it
didn't<00:00:52.690> give<00:00:52.840> them<00:00:53.079> anything<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.739> we<00:00:54.609> had<00:00:54.730> the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
didn't give them anything and we had the

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.729 
didn't give them anything and we had the
ball<00:00:55.030> controlled<00:00:55.539> it<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.870> in<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.410> second<00:00:56.649> of

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
ball controlled it and in the second of

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.290 
ball controlled it and in the second of
it<00:00:56.890> created<00:00:57.219> things<00:00:57.399> as<00:00:57.550> well<00:00:57.699> and<00:00:57.879> that's<00:00:57.969> how

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
it created things as well and that's how

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.119 
it created things as well and that's how
I<00:00:58.690> want<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:58.960> be<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.589> since<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.890> great

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
I want to be it since a great

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.560 
I want to be it since a great

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.460 
clap together
yeah<00:01:06.010> that's<00:01:06.369> important<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.960> need<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.200> find

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
yeah that's important we need to find

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.859 
yeah that's important we need to find
the<00:01:08.590> spaces<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.250> from<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:09.880> we<00:01:10.600> need<00:01:10.750> to

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
the spaces and from there we need to

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.870 
the spaces and from there we need to
link<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.829> wingers<00:01:12.159> with<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.490> full-backs

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
link up the wingers with the full-backs

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.219 
link up the wingers with the full-backs
we<00:01:13.090> need<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.329> link<00:01:13.479> up<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:13.810> two<00:01:13.930> strikers

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
we need to link up the two strikers

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.800 
we need to link up the two strikers
together<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:15.130> then<00:01:15.670> things<00:01:16.540> will<00:01:16.720> get

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
together and then things will get

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.030 
together and then things will get
quicker<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.290> last<00:01:17.500> third<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.829> pitch

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
quicker in the last third of the pitch

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.100 
quicker in the last third of the pitch
and<00:01:18.280> things<00:01:18.820> will<00:01:18.939> happen<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.780> really<00:01:19.990> what

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
and things will happen so really what

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.480 
and things will happen so really what
did<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.290> see<00:01:20.439> at<00:01:20.530> halftime<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.979> your<00:01:21.250> players

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
did you see at halftime to your players

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.100 
did you see at halftime to your players
because<00:01:21.939> there<00:01:22.210> was<00:01:22.299> a<00:01:22.329> lot<00:01:22.570> more<00:01:22.600> chances

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
because there was a lot more chances

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.160 
because there was a lot more chances
created<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.590> 10<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:23.860> second<00:01:24.250> 45<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.930> talked

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
created a 10 to the second 45 we talked

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.069 
created a 10 to the second 45 we talked
about<00:01:27.149> defense<00:01:28.149> was<00:01:28.360> good<00:01:28.509> not<00:01:28.659> if<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:28.869> keep

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
about defense was good not if you keep

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.740 
about defense was good not if you keep
up<00:01:29.259> keep<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.100> concentration<00:01:30.700> but<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:31.509> need<00:01:31.630> to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
up keep the concentration but we need to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.420 
up keep the concentration but we need to
play<00:01:31.899> much<00:01:32.079> more<00:01:32.110> forward<00:01:32.680> we<00:01:32.920> play<00:01:33.100> too<00:01:33.159> much

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
play much more forward we play too much

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.580 
play much more forward we play too much
sideways<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.119> then<00:01:34.360> it's<00:01:34.540> easy<00:01:34.719> to<00:01:34.930> defend<00:01:35.200> we

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
sideways and then it's easy to defend we

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.109 
sideways and then it's easy to defend we
need<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.860> play<00:01:36.009> good<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.610> get<00:01:36.759> through<00:01:36.969> them

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
need to play good to get through them

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.300 
need to play good to get through them
and<00:01:37.659> then<00:01:37.780> we<00:01:37.930> need<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.259> penetration<00:01:38.799> runs<00:01:39.130> as

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
and then we need the penetration runs as

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.510 
and then we need the penetration runs as
well<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.290> runs<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.560> open<00:01:41.890> space<00:01:41.950> for<00:01:42.100> others

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
well and runs to open space for others

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.010 
well and runs to open space for others
and<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:42.909> think<00:01:43.450> that's<00:01:43.600> was<00:01:43.689> better<00:01:43.899> in<00:01:43.990> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and I think that's was better in the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.639 
and I think that's was better in the
second<00:01:44.320> half

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
second half

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.319 
second half
do<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.009> think<00:01:45.219> it<00:01:45.340> times<00:01:45.549> perhaps<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.090> walk

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
do you think it times perhaps the walk

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.209 
do you think it times perhaps the walk
wasn't<00:01:46.539> when<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:46.840> say<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.229> we<00:01:47.380> had<00:01:47.920> across

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
wasn't when you say this we had across

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.529 
wasn't when you say this we had across
part<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.549> number<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:48.939> occasions

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
part of number of occasions

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
yeah but as much in the previous matches

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.550 
yeah but as much in the previous matches
we<00:01:54.490> have<00:01:54.670> scored<00:01:55.149> in<00:01:55.210> every<00:01:55.360> chance<00:01:55.659> we<00:01:55.810> had<00:01:55.960> so
