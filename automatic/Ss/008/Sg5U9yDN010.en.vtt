00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
backstory and all around it was pretty

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
backstory and all around it was pretty
cool<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.079> wish<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.500> didn't<00:01:43.740> escape<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
cool I wish they didn't escape like that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
cool I wish they didn't escape like that
but<00:01:44.700> judging<00:01:45.180> from<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.540> title<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> next

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
but judging from the title the next

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.090 
but judging from the title the next
episode

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
episode

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
episode
Lupe's<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.820> fight<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.659> guessing

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
Lupe's gonna fight you so I'm guessing

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
Lupe's gonna fight you so I'm guessing
because<00:01:49.530> next<00:01:50.100> episode<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.610> believe<00:01:50.820> in

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
because next episode is I believe in

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.060 
because next episode is I believe in
title<00:01:51.509> Snoopy<00:01:51.810> versus<00:01:52.110> shoes<00:01:52.290> though<00:01:52.530> but

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
title Snoopy versus shoes though but

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
title Snoopy versus shoes though but
either<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.460> still<00:01:53.700> sounds<00:01:54.270> pretty<00:01:54.479> cool<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
either way it still sounds pretty cool I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
either way it still sounds pretty cool I
like<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.110> battles<00:01:55.640> animation<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
like the battles animation was a little

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.940 
like the battles animation was a little
wonky<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.390> they're<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:57.899> um<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.350> forget

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
wonky here they're like um I forget

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.350 
wonky here they're like um I forget
exactly<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.759> think<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.180> like

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
exactly what it was I think it was like

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.899 
exactly what it was I think it was like
a<00:02:00.600> shoe<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.040> throwing<00:02:02.280> punches<00:02:02.549> or

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
a shoe so was like throwing punches or

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
a shoe so was like throwing punches or
something<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.570> animation<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.380> real

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
something and like animation was real

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.109 
something and like animation was real
weird<00:02:04.799> when<00:02:05.009> he<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.219> moving<00:02:05.430> his<00:02:05.549> head<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
weird when he was moving his head and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.869 
weird when he was moving his head and
when<00:02:06.420> luffy<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.049> blocking<00:02:07.890> or<00:02:08.280> dodging

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
when luffy was like blocking or dodging

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.609 
when luffy was like blocking or dodging
it<00:02:09.030> was<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.569> weird<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.379> wasn't

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it was like a little weird so it wasn't

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.199 
it was like a little weird so it wasn't
the<00:02:10.679> best<00:02:10.800> animation<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.550> still<00:02:12.000> nonetheless

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
the best animation but still nonetheless

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.460 
the best animation but still nonetheless
cool<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.080> once

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
cool to see it once

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.340 
cool to see it once
and<00:02:13.560> brings<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> question<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.450> ro<00:02:15.930> at

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and brings up the question is ro at

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.680 
and brings up the question is ro at
vice-admiral<00:02:17.160> level<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.360> don't<00:02:18.420> want<00:02:18.630> to

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
vice-admiral level like I don't want to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.970 
vice-admiral level like I don't want to
spoil<00:02:18.960> things<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.500> happens<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
spoil things with what happens in the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.670 
spoil things with what happens in the
manga<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.660> judging<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:22.050> how<00:02:22.200> some<00:02:22.560> other

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
manga but judging from how some other

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.770 
manga but judging from how some other
characters<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.610> were<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.970> par<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.330> Zora

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
characters that were on par with Zora

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.950 
characters that were on par with Zora
one<00:02:25.050> given<00:02:25.350> point<00:02:25.790> seemingly<00:02:26.790> might<00:02:27.390> beyond

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
one given point seemingly might beyond

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.380 
one given point seemingly might beyond
there<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> possibility<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.940> Cyril

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
there so it's a possibility that Cyril

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
there so it's a possibility that Cyril
might<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.900> vice-admiral<00:02:31.410> level<00:02:31.860> same

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
might be on vice-admiral level same

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.980 
might be on vice-admiral level same
thing<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.370> loopy<00:02:32.670> as<00:02:32.760> well<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.870> this

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
thing with loopy as well but this

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.330 
thing with loopy as well but this
episode<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.440> definitely<00:02:34.740> interesting<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.190> see

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
episode is definitely interesting to see

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.800 
that will it be considered Canon I mean
it<00:02:38.550> looks<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.940> though<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.210> had<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.450> be<00:02:39.540> approved

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it looks as though it had to be approved

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.500 
it looks as though it had to be approved
by<00:02:39.990> Oda<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:40.680> again<00:02:41.010> film<00:02:41.850> Z<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.210> supposed

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
probably it was more interesting to me

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.199 
probably it was more interesting to me
that<00:03:34.890> Luffy<00:03:35.340> versus<00:03:35.640> shoes<00:03:35.820> though<00:03:36.090> because

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
as cool as Shuzo is manga is actually

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.300 
as cool as Shuzo is manga is actually
part<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.110> know<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> entire<00:03:40.920> story

part of the you know the entire story

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.759 
part of the you know the entire story
he's<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.550> freakin<00:03:42.150> price<00:03:42.390> admiral<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.350> really

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
would have loved to see a conclusion to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.750 
would have loved to see a conclusion to
that<00:03:45.780> battle<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.709> sure<00:03:46.920> they<00:03:47.070> can't

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760

touch<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.000> too<00:03:48.269> much<00:03:48.420> because<00:03:48.600> Oda<00:03:49.380> probably

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
touch it too much because Oda probably

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.289 
touch it too much because Oda probably
has<00:03:49.799> some<00:03:49.980> plans<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.549> nonetheless<00:03:50.880> yeah
