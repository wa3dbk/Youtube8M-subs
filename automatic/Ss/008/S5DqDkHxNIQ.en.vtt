clips here one two three four clips and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.780 
clips here one two three four clips and
we're<00:00:31.260> using<00:00:31.619> our<00:00:31.949> favorite<00:00:32.430> trim<00:00:32.669> your

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we're using our favorite trim your

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
we're using our favorite trim your
moving<00:00:33.090> tool<00:00:33.329> again<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> basically<00:00:34.500> we've

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
moving tool again and basically we've

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.950 
moving tool again and basically we've
got<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> pool<00:00:35.570> just<00:00:36.570> pour<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.890> top<00:00:38.190> edge<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
got a pool just pour the the top edge of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.240 
got a pool just pour the the top edge of
this<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.350> there'll<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.620> these<00:00:40.800> plastic

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this I think there'll be these plastic

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
this I think there'll be these plastic
rivet<00:00:41.579> things<00:00:41.910> again<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
rivet things again so if we can get this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.430 
rivet things again so if we can get this
under<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> hair

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.689 

what

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.549 

okay<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:56.359> basically<00:00:56.870> pulled<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:57.230> middle<00:00:57.469> out

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
okay so basically pulled the middle out

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.740 
okay so basically pulled the middle out
of<00:00:57.679> the<00:00:57.739> plastic<00:00:58.129> rivet<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.089> then<00:00:59.269> we<00:00:59.420> should

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
of the plastic rivet and then we should

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.860 
of the plastic rivet and then we should
be<00:01:00.260> able<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.409> pull<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.679> plastic<00:01:00.890> rivet<00:01:01.399> out

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
be able to pull the plastic rivet out

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.859 
be able to pull the plastic rivet out

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.230 
it's one of these expanding plastic
rivet<00:01:06.140> types<00:01:06.549> let's<00:01:07.549> see<00:01:07.790> if<00:01:07.850> we<00:01:07.970> can<00:01:08.090> get

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
rivet types let's see if we can get

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.639 
rivet types let's see if we can get
those<00:01:08.420> out<00:01:09.280> similar<00:01:10.280> manner<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.289> question

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
those out similar manner it's a question

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.740 
those out similar manner it's a question
of<00:01:12.710> getting<00:01:12.979> under<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.399> it's<00:01:14.149> quite<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.479> flush

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
of getting under the it's quite a flush

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:42.970 
of getting under the it's quite a flush
fit<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.899> games

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.860 

I<00:01:43.100> won't<00:01:43.610> think<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.850> could<00:01:44.090> do<00:01:44.330> here<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.780> you

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
I won't think you could do here is you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.230 
I won't think you could do here is you
can<00:01:44.900> put<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.200> little<00:01:45.380> bit<00:01:45.500> of<00:01:45.680> card<00:01:46.090> under<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
can put a little bit of card under the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.970 
can put a little bit of card under the
surface<00:01:47.780> there<00:01:48.170> where<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.500> leave<00:01:48.680> from<00:01:48.860> it

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
surface there where you leave from it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.480 
surface there where you leave from it

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
on this side it's a question of pulling

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.340 
on this side it's a question of pulling
it<00:02:40.740> directly<00:02:41.310> back<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.330> if<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.870> and
