00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 a very easy smokey eyes perfect for 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.060
 when we have little time 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.060
 let's see how to make it in this video 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.349
 with a soft eye shadow brush 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.109
 we apply a bright white eyeshadow 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.600
 both on the eyebrow arch and on the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.560
 mobile eyelid in order to create a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 light base we take a black eye shadow 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.250
 and with an angled brush we go to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 darken the area the hairline 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.539
 upper lashes lengthening up 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 outside in order to create the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.579
 direction we need to follow for 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.110
 creating our smokey eyes is 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.300
 important that the line extends towards 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.739
 upwards so as not to make the eye appear 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.899
 falling we take a black pencil 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.320
 maybe that ends with a smudge that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 it will then help us to fade the color 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 excuse the external area of ​​the eye 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.949
 fade the color up to the middle of the eyelid 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.660
 from outside to inside arriving 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.489
 up to the natural crease of the eye 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.559
 without getting too close to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 eyebrows to keep clean 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.090
 best nuance 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.220
 then take a pencil and a soft e 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.510
 creamy metallic gray e 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.240
 we apply it in the internal area 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.280
 of the eye we can help ourselves with the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.580
 finger to spread it better and fade it to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 black 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.640
