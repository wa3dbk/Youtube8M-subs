00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.500
Words that kill

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Pride, feeds their blackened hearts

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.500
And the thirst, must be quenched, to fuel hypocrisy

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.000
Cleansing flames, is the only way to repent

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.800
Renounce, what made you

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
Renounce, what made you
Words that kill

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Words that kill

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Would you speak them to me

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.800
With your breath so still

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.000
It makes me believe

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.500
The Sins never die

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.000
Can't wash this blood off our hands

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let the world fear us all

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's just means to an end

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.500
Our salvation lies

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500
Our salvation lies
In the Father's sins

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.000
In the Father's sins

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.500
Beyond the truth

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500
Beyond the truth
Let me suffer now

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500
Let me suffer now

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.000
In my heart I just know that there's no way to light up the dark

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.500
In his eyes
