00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.830
 but again 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.339
 but that was not necessary 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.119
 Kristen Stewart lets explain put 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.739

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.509
 Have the law of relegation in your pocket 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.570
 I pray for it 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 so percent 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.110
 the revised one 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.110
 April likes best covering this week may 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 Rheine 8 such are not entirely unexpected 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.260
 H 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 8th 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.570
 and he had declared that over the water 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430
 and now we have 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.590
 a heavyweight 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.120
 if you keep it 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.760
 talent 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.630
 the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.909
 Witch Bellatrix happen 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.910
 but not out 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.510
 tow 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.230
 Eppstein and 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.930
 Experts want 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.970
 Jost is 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.240
 or even a euro he has to be centralized in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.220
 the first 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.540
 Pacult energy consumption better 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.200
 a secret choice 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.760
 But that is now gone well sda Erika Schmidt now even in 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.690
 go second step as Andreas Glockner made the cash even the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.370
 Munich almost alone the winner Jakob who declined to do so 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.250
 often gives runs 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 that does not fit 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.390
 I 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.009
 how is it all clear we had all worries Noske Met 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.670
 it gets better 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.680
 Bergen went hiking I do not like this 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.940
 Found room 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.870
 Boney m 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.010
 keep it up 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.990
 Protect Bangkok 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.020
 and then 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.480
 at the 4 the 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.920
 Wilders became 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.460
 SN APA but after all it does not make one more dependent has one 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.019
 integrated country in the world took chords Astoria 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.559
 also places were made difficult because Brunner both were photo MÃ¼ller 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.419
 so definitely one again 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.989
 Berlin as with the costs 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.509
 1 the interesting ones 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.709
 on the other hand says Jost 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.959
 that costs 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.439
 the current employee had been further secured wildlife and Dr
