00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.590 
technical the reason why I went to music
was<00:03:02.020> because<00:03:02.410> my<00:03:02.830> camera<00:03:03.250> was<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:03.610> chitty<00:03:03.940> that

was because my camera was so chitty that

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.690 
was because my camera was so chitty that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the sound on it was horrible so I'd

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.940 
the sound on it was horrible so I'd
shoot<00:03:06.940> these<00:03:07.150> sketches<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.650> like<00:03:08.770> well

that you can just import audio and then

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.910 
that you can just import audio and then
bring<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> volume<00:03:13.390> down<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:14.140> then<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.769> have
