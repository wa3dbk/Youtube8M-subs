00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 thank 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.799
 in 2008 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.799
 I intend to speak expeditions 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.779
 also read in the issue 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.949
 all this will spawn equipment 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 I keep searching for a source in the area 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 Yuri Seagull Cabinet Source 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.930
 yet nothing 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.620
 rewards will be the source 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 really water 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.770
 27 h 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.770
 I want to say we lost 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 unfortunately not always the case 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 we have a fire hazard 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 four times 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.539
 provided 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.539
 I do not like that source 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.350
 as taught 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.410
 this time itâ€™s already clear your question 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 rolled steel 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.890
 know why 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 every business 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.660
 Voronezh 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.759
 saw it
