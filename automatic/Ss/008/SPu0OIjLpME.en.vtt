00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.570
 when it comes to dean potter i 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 extreme sports enthusiasts yes 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.330
 divide into two on one side those who 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.500
 idolize on the other those who 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 they condemn his reckless exploits 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 we met her October a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.220
 bressanone during the International 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 mountain summit where we have 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.210
 took advantage of a wonderful excursion 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.369
 in his company to the shelter 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.369
 gatterer to get to know him better 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.030
 generally remains when they ask me how 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.650
 you are my background career that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.780
 I started climbing because i 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.510
 my parents told me not to go 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.700
 on the rock it was dangerous when then 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 I realized that the mountains were 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.019
 definitely something dangerous but 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.910
 also a way for me to escape the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.700
 right that if in my life I 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.290
 oppressed it bored me then I was 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.900
 as enraptured by the beauty of this 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.330
 it helped me more than any other 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.269
 another thing for which in the end it is for me 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.819
 It was easy to decide to go 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.709
 towards these situations full of 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.709
 beauty spread in the family you goal col 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.250
 given to knowledge and what a pathway looks for 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.250
 do you remember 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.920
 actually I forgot what I was going for 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.769
 looking for those times but i know they are 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.790
 been captured by the lens 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.819
 of climbing and subsequently 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.910
 learned autodidact assis none 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.430
 oestrus and bees carmi only that is 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.130
 without protection I learned so not 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.220
 having very clear in my mind that to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.920
 least mistake being dead so I was 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.500
 totally focused on what I was doing 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.049
 and I think it was this feeling 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.880
 catch me completely before 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.519
 in fact my mind wanders but 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.739
 simultaneously towards a 1000 age 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.530
 directions when I started 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.970
 I concentrated on climbing 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.740
 one direction 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.680
 one goal and I felt 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.760
 really good 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.980
 but you never fear the movies I try 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.560
 fear like any other person but the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.350
 fear in my case brings with it this 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.750
 great concentration adds to mine 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.660
 be much more than what it takes away 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.000
 more power more fura science mimmo since 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.250
 double ex 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.990
 and therefore my will is stronger 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.970
 of fear and what I said 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.760
 putting myself to these situations of 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.380
 danger in the end is much greater than 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.010
 what normally fear can 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.010
 subtract
