00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
say that there were a lot of references

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810 
say that there were a lot of references

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to the book a wrinkle in time which I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.630 
to the book a wrinkle in time which I
happen<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.180> own<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> haven't<00:01:55.079> read

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
happen to own but I haven't read

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.610

and there were references to it in the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.930 
and there were references to it in the
book<00:01:57.800> because<00:01:58.130> it's<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> main<00:01:58.550> characters

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
book because it's the main characters

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
references in the plot that I probably

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.469 
references in the plot that I probably
didn't<00:02:07.190> pick<00:02:07.310> up<00:02:07.460> on<00:02:07.610> because<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:07.970> haven't<00:02:08.330> read
