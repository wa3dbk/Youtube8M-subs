00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.910
 quick and so the best is very 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.500
 quick personal search was very good 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.830
 the only defect I found in this 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 device was that some channels in HD 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.950
 he is only opening audio in four 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020
 channels in hd that are watching audio only 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.840
 but if you stick with the channel grid 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.340
 in front of him is passing said tian 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.910
