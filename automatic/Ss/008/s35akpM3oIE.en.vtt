don't know the tooltip for conceal it

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.020 
don't know the tooltip for conceal it
says<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.840> reduces<00:03:21.260> rain<00:03:21.530> damage<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:22.910> is

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
actually incorrect it reduces all

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.759 
actually incorrect it reduces all
damaged<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.390> basically<00:03:26.600> fortune<00:03:27.380> but

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
damaged so it's basically fortune but

was worried about with the Eldar fleet
of<00:04:18.019> foot<00:04:18.140> ability<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> ability<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:19.280> really

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
of foot ability the ability to really

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.039 
of foot ability the ability to really
cover<00:04:19.789> the<00:04:19.970> map<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.180> lot<00:04:20.419> quicker<00:04:20.660> than<00:04:20.870> the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
cover the map a lot quicker than the

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.590 
cover the map a lot quicker than the
pastry<00:04:21.680> employer<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.850> devastators<00:04:23.510> a

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
pastry employer so the devastators a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.940 
pastry employer so the devastators a
tough<00:04:23.810> choice<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.229> this<00:04:24.320> matter<00:04:24.380> yeah<00:04:24.680> but

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
tough choice in this matter yeah but

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.650 
tough choice in this matter yeah but
we're<00:04:25.460> already<00:04:25.610> seeing<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.090> SM
