00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.029
 foto ap bershka dynamic tips there was growth 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.510
 wp 40 if you always have news 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.429
 psd is an exercise that does not 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.379
 they use the pitch back only forward 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.890
 it depends a lot on the water to capture the energy so that we can do the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.970
 Reasonable pitch is not the rudders with the same distance but is a pitch 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.089
 useful in various positions 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.359
 and we fish that situation in all that is to have two basically first 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.369
 it is when you have a structure behind you that you do not mind doing black 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.280
 I still have the wall, there's something that did not leave me 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.640
 becker monday 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.950
 I'm fishing with more kaká funda 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.800
 a line that points 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.280
 just one end of the line that sank a leader who points out that if I am to take 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 from water 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.690
 of the banésfácil was raised twice loses so great 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.370
 that break 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.130
 you would make a home of your grandfather if he betrayed that he was a rita rita grimace and would give 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.800
 tahrir 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.770
 would throw 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.040
 the water line when it comes out of the water separate the black earth 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.150
 and then you would put it back 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.060
 now I'll do it step by step 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.550
 so you can 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.520
 observe 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.640
 and understand the mechanism 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.740
 first thing I do not shoot when I go draw water line stick line 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.170
 To start a pitch, whatever it is I should avoid. 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.009
 keep pulling 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.370
 and throwing water 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.770
 taking the gold the air make decide to cut my god throw the whole line that I 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.650
 I want on the floor and make a move with the tip of the rod stuck attached celina 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 of the end releasing here to take the whole line that is here 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.670
 why is it that makes our super of the assomasul for all the rest bring the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.310
 line slowly 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.480
 slowly and I can not lose contact with the water bring alignment 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.579
 and that's bing the reel 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.049
 so she had more or less the cheese plan 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.040
 to bring the line very slowly to climb the reel more or less at the height of the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.260
 chin and is already deserving 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.659
 the ear plane and stop the wave 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.309
 on Sunday 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:15.900
 I will bring reel breath the plane of the cheese down the plane of the ear 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.620
 to disperse the passat line you say cart behind in stop 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.180
 It's as if I have here a single hammer on a board in my 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.180
 waist 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.689
 Look at my arm. 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.789
 how are the scorer 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:43.289
 do not do this to me as if I leave a simulation screen is the motto of the 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.289
 hammer on waist 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:51.059
 worse at the waist and aggravate the peak parallel to water 8 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.699
 I've been working just to show you the thrill of fishing the fruit with 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.409
 sites in america and canada edges very much almost looks 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.660
 batella had already scored the high so far 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.660
 to mark the awesome run 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.999
 already took those that acted it was for you that this song is a 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.969
 party 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.649
 many because final value to acr it should approve the motion 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.949
 It's the color of the ball. 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.169
 I have hope that trout fishing there 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.649
 oh right there her 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.589
 dow jones 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.019
 the state of the river is what age is the strategy formula 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.359
 we are going to lose our first commercial block 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.539
 and bet 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:35.849
 with another fishery 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.359
 photo the girl told me it was good that she already spared serious looks at the coral snake 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.719
 consultations by her father 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.399
 only showed tone whether the party already has only one 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.569
 the fiscal launched
