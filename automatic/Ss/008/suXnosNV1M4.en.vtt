hair is a softer rubber so that this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.480 
braid and this part of the hair doesn't
doesn't<00:02:01.570> get<00:02:01.810> in<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:01.990> way<00:02:02.050> of<00:02:02.229> him<00:02:02.650> lifting

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
doesn't get in the way of him lifting

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.830 
doesn't get in the way of him lifting
his<00:02:03.520> head<00:02:03.610> up<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.060> down<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.210> stuff<00:02:04.630> because

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
his head up and down and stuff because

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.010 
his head up and down and stuff because
it<00:02:05.200> gives<00:02:05.860> away<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.190> bit<00:02:06.429> same<00:02:06.820> with<00:02:06.940> this<00:02:07.119> sash

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it gives away a bit same with this sash

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.640 
it gives away a bit same with this sash
it's<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:09.570> little<00:02:10.570> little<00:02:11.020> softer<00:02:13.020> if<00:02:14.020> Klaus<00:02:14.350> can

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
it's a little little softer if Klaus can

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.010 
it's a little little softer if Klaus can
come<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.069> but<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.120> best<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.690> leave<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
come out but it's best just to leave the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.500 
come out but it's best just to leave the
law<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.380> think<00:02:17.790> since<00:02:18.790> he<00:02:18.910> rarely<00:02:19.150> take

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
law and I think since he rarely take

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.390 
law and I think since he rarely take
them<00:02:19.690> off<00:02:22.140> know<00:02:23.140> what<00:02:23.319> else<00:02:23.470> his<00:02:23.710> nipples<00:02:24.160> are

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
them off know what else his nipples are

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.760 
them off know what else his nipples are
a<00:02:24.490> different<00:02:24.940> color<00:02:25.270> than<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.170> rest<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.650> his

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
a different color than the rest of his

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.790 
a different color than the rest of his
skin<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.280> his<00:02:28.170> fingernails<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.350> can<00:02:29.590> tell

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
skin and his fingernails you can tell

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.530 
skin and his fingernails you can tell
here<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.190> they're<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> slightly<00:02:31.030> different

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
here but they're a slightly different

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.410 
here but they're a slightly different
shade<00:02:32.140> than<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.980> rest<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> them<00:02:33.430> as<00:02:33.550> well<00:02:33.760> now

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
shade than the rest of them as well now

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.940 
shade than the rest of them as well now
I<00:02:34.450> think<00:02:34.569> that's<00:02:34.870> really<00:02:35.080> good<00:02:35.350> attention<00:02:35.650> to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
I think that's really good attention to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.230 
I think that's really good attention to
detail<00:02:37.740> because<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:39.370> know<00:02:39.460> nobody<00:02:39.910> really

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
detail because you know nobody really

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.340 
detail because you know nobody really
would<00:02:40.390> have<00:02:40.450> complained<00:02:40.870> if<00:02:40.870> they<00:02:41.110> had<00:02:41.260> to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
would have complained if they had to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.170 
would have complained if they had to
just<00:02:41.560> painted<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.400> nails<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> nipples

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
just painted the nails and the nipples

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
just painted the nails and the nipples
the<00:02:43.240> same<00:02:43.450> color<00:02:43.720> as<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.930> skin<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.459> went

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the same color as the skin but they went

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.930 
the same color as the skin but they went
that<00:02:45.819> extra<00:02:46.000> mile<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.480> go<00:02:46.810> ahead<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.940> really

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that extra mile to go ahead and really

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.730
