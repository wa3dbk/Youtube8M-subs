00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.699
 has to do 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.449
 For example, eavesdropping is the conversation between 1 and a surgeon 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.759
 we have a patient 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.240
 he has to go to psychiatry 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.369
 he is sure table 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.890
 that happened 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.050
 he is sure table 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.269
 says the chief physician 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 he has to go to psychiatry 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.269
 he has my way 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.849
 I do not know 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.500

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.920
 Must go to psychiatry says the chief physician 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.640
 so 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 so formulated 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.130
 he is with you in surgery 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.360
 he was operated on 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 which and how went well 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.130
 now is the Zurich table 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.700
 I understand already 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.200
 but he was still parried 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.800
 it was a plastic and lies 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.330
 Rhinoplasty the patient wanted a nicer nose 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.910
 it is a private patient 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 the Open went well 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.220
 So there were no complications in the operation 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.970
 the patient lost a lot of blood 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 so four to five liters but we have refilled him everything went well 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.160
 but now is the Zurich defense 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 What does the patient show in% for Zumtobel? 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.190
 I am not a psychiatrist 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.350
 the head doctor says he is safe table 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.040
 he should go to psychiatry 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.719
 even if they are quite secure because they try to offer anyway 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.330
 to describe the symptoms of the patient 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.050
 he lies there with his eyes open and does not move 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.290
 he is sure table 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.580
 says the chief physician 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.090
 the patient could touch the patient before the operation 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.780
 for a 98-year-old patient Bayer before the Unbill the mobile 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.660
 You have a 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.979
 98 years 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.280
 one cooperates 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.670
 the one 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.550
 after a correction wanted 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.070
 he is a private patient 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 the chief physician says 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.080
 he was very mobile for his age 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.520
 now is the psychiatric 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.220
 he has to be transferred to them 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.600
 the obi went well 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.359
 we can not do anything for him anymore 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.330
 they have considered 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.860
 that the old age in combination with the dog and blood loss 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.829
 the brain of the patient could have harmed 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.259
 the Open went well 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.489
 we filled up the blood loss 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.369

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.369
 they have to take it over, says the chief physician 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.150
 but they can not easily with a patient of 98 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.489
 Years old 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.649

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.799
 now it is safe table 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.590
 Do they ever have one? 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.120
 severe brain damage 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.420
 Phnom Penh considered by the operation as cause why itself 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.599
 the patient no longer stirs 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.239
 I can not judge that 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.379
 I am not a psychiatrist the patient must be transferred to them with us he is 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.509

 the chief physician says 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.920
 until the psychiatrists realize that 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.820
 that the patient is brain dead will pass a few days and then they will have to 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.770
 to deal with the insurance and the relatives
