extra<00:00:53.820> BCAAs<00:00:54.719> glue<00:00:55.110> demeans<00:00:55.410> proteins<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
extra BCAAs glue demeans proteins so I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.430 
extra BCAAs glue demeans proteins so I
like<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:58.190> hammer<00:00:59.190> recover<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:01.320> can

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
like to use hammer recover right you can

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.670 
like to use hammer recover right you can

this<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.100> makes<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.670> smoother

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
this and that just makes for a smoother

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
this and that just makes for a smoother
smoothie<00:01:26.390> now<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> trick<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> want

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850

to always put your heavy non sticky
items<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.630> first<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
items in first so I like to do this in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.730 
items in first so I like to do this in
this<00:01:36.689> order<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:38.930> I'm<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.049> use<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> kale

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
this order here I'm gonna use the kale

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.340 
this order here I'm gonna use the kale
push<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:43.159> go<00:01:46.430> okay<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> then

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
push all of that down go okay and then

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
push all of that down go okay and then
before<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> seeds<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:51.740> like<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
before I have the seeds I like to or the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.340 
before I have the seeds I like to or the
liquids<00:01:54.649> this<00:01:55.649> prevents<00:01:56.219> everything<00:01:56.640> from

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
liquids this prevents everything from

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
liquids this prevents everything from
bunching<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> bottom

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.190 

so<00:02:03.370> I<00:02:03.400> usually<00:02:03.670> get<00:02:04.000> pretty<00:02:04.600> close<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.960> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
so I usually get pretty close to the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.740 
so I usually get pretty close to the
fill<00:02:05.410> line<00:02:06.060> maybe<00:02:07.060> add<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.540> bit<00:02:07.660> of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
fill line maybe add a little bit of

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.170 
fill line maybe add a little bit of
coconut<00:02:07.960> milk<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.560> there<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.910> for

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
coconut milk in there just for

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.990 
coconut milk in there just for
creaminess<00:02:11.130> one<00:02:12.130> thing<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.490> forgot<00:02:12.670> to

market using a local organic honey will

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.340 
market using a local organic honey will
help<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.090> mitigate<00:02:28.800> pollen<00:02:29.800> allergies<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:32.080> now

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
help to mitigate pollen allergies so now

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.460 
help to mitigate pollen allergies so now
let's<00:02:32.560> drop<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.980> seeds<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.200> probably

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
let's drop the seeds in this is probably

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.390 
let's drop the seeds in this is probably
about<00:02:36.750> three<00:02:37.750> tablespoons<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.920> seeds<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
little bit of the hammer recover right

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.380 
little bit of the hammer recover right
simply<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.650> athletic<00:02:51.520> muscle<00:02:51.970> recovery

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390
