00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
I've got a lot of questions I'm letting

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.310 
I've got a lot of questions I'm letting
everything<00:00:25.890> soak<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.490> I'm<00:00:26.640> letting<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.910> ways

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
everything soak in I'm letting the ways

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.589 
everything soak in I'm letting the ways
three<00:00:28.320> years<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> he<00:00:30.390> had<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
three years so can you know I he had a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
three years so can you know I he had a
good<00:00:30.990> year<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.439> defense<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.340> consistent

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
good year the defense was one consistent

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.360 
good year the defense was one consistent
thing<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:34.079> Dallas<00:00:34.410> Cowboys<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> guess

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
thing of these Dallas Cowboys so I guess

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
thing of these Dallas Cowboys so I guess
he<00:00:35.520> did<00:00:35.730> deserve<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.380> guy

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
he did deserve it but is he the guy

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
championship game the New York Jets I've

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
championship game the New York Jets I've
been<00:01:01.079> predicting<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> beat<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.489> colts

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
been predicting them to beat the colts

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
been predicting them to beat the colts
for<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> last<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.719> weeks<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.439> some

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
for the last two weeks now for some

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.590 
for the last two weeks now for some
reason<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.339> fixated<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.090> them<00:01:06.299> playing<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
reason I was fixated on them playing the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.330 
reason I was fixated on them playing the
colts<00:01:06.840> last<00:01:07.200> week<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:07.979> played<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
colts last week when they played the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460 
colts last week when they played the
charger<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.570> gonna<00:01:09.810> give<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.080> same

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
charger so I'm gonna give you the same

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.250 
charger so I'm gonna give you the same
predictions<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.189> gave<00:01:11.400> last<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.869> UM

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
predictions I gave last time with the UM

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.800 
predictions I gave last time with the UM
with<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.490> Colts<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> Jets

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
with with the Colts I think the Jets

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.890 
with with the Colts I think the Jets
corners<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:17.130> make<00:01:17.820> Peyton<00:01:18.119> Manning<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
corners can make Peyton Manning have to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.310 
corners can make Peyton Manning have to
think<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:19.920> longer<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.729> make<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
think just a little bit longer to make a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.649 
think just a little bit longer to make a
more<00:01:22.320> safer<00:01:22.710> decisions<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.729> football<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
more safer decisions with football that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
more safer decisions with football that
will<00:01:24.840> severely<00:01:25.380> slow<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.100> offense<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
will severely slow that offense down and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
will severely slow that offense down and
if<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.320> they've<00:01:28.500> been<00:01:28.710> doing

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
if they do that like they've been doing

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
if they do that like they've been doing
then<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> Jets<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> good<00:01:31.020> chance

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
then I think the Jets have a good chance

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.830 
then I think the Jets have a good chance
of<00:01:31.500> beating<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.100> colts<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of beating the colts and going to the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
of beating the colts and going to the
Super<00:01:34.079> Bowl<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.799> many<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> thought<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
Super Bowl how many I thought that the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.340 
Super Bowl how many I thought that the
beginning<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> year<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:37.110> really

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
beginning a year really really really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
beginning a year really really really
really<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.860> far<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.159> did<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.490> team<00:01:38.670> last

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
really what far up did in a team last

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
really what far up did in a team last
year<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.360> how<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.570> fell<00:01:39.780> apart<00:01:40.049> how<00:01:40.530> many<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
year and how they fell apart how many of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.039 
year and how they fell apart how many of
