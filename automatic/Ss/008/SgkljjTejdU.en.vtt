00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
zoom out now you can see that we want to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
zoom out now you can see that we want to
remove<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> LCD<00:01:17.220> covers<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> crucial

little<00:01:25.140> tab<00:01:25.320> once<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.860> with<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
little tab once we do that then with the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
little tab once we do that then with the
flathead<00:01:29.340> driver<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> course<00:01:30.090> once<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.420> do

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
flathead driver of course once we do

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.789 
flathead driver of course once we do
that<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.530> comes<00:01:31.890> off<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.710> only<00:01:34.710> an

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
that it comes off like so and only an

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.170 
that it comes off like so and only an
idiot<00:01:34.890> could<00:01:35.189> screw<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.790> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
idiot could screw this up really it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
idiot could screw this up really it's
pretty<00:01:36.390> simple<00:01:37.460> then<00:01:39.439> there<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.829> how

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
pretty simple then there you go see how

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
pretty simple then there you go see how

just experiment find what fits in the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.420 
just experiment find what fits in the
hole<00:02:34.400> pull<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> off<00:02:35.720> then<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.840> got<00:02:36.990> this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
hole pull that off then you got this
