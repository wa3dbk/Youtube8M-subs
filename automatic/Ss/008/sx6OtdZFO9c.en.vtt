00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.480
 well first you have to lower the 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.180
 wefaq master 14 can search it or if not 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.510
 use the web I know they leave comments 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.359
 videos 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.050
 and to install is everything to follow 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.050
 by title 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 if they have windows 7 or windows 8 what 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.240
 they have to run as administrator 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.400
 if I do not think that 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.650
 well a florist seems all in gray 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.380
 just as blocked is normal because it does not 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.050
 you have the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.920
 Open file to open open 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.920
 fifa 14 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.370
 do not 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.920
 good to load 1.007 this has a 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.399
 lots of options but what we want 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 do is change the visit is going to take 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.170
 visits 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.250
 shine 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.250
 Hold it open 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.980
 good here sees you in this position more here 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.210
 this is the list of all the equipment 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.560
 of game here you can change the shirts 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.299
 what to all living sectors 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.299
 in this case you can change the mouth 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:37.200
 on the web it was stand-in 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.200
 so the titular goalkeeper 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.530
 here has five images the first one is 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.659
 The shield 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.610
 according to eye that is the shield of the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.450
 shirt not the club's shield that's 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.450
 change elsewhere 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.130
 the shirt I have no idea what lines 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.620
 they are not touched by doubt and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.860
 pants and the average also the part 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.050
 up are the measure 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:10.690
 and another thing that I want to change 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.690
 first I discover myself to change him 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.959
 on the shield or whatever to change 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.319
 the image that is here in the game 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.020
 original go here this little button with the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.720
 red ribbon that says it matters to the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.740
 I doubt I recommend you always save 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.770
 the image of the game and final 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.190
 clemente is a can exports with fire to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.190
 Where you want 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 you put here no matter when they 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.950
 they put the new search where only enough 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.599
 good case 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.819
 I change the shield for the shirt that 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.540
 I want to put on it's going to be very dark 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.760
 the ass 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 always put to save for the doubts 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.519
 now I want to change the shirt 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.519
 normally it matters 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.750
 best 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.350
 see what change now you want to see how 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.970
 fuck stick 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.640
 necessary entered I knew fifa as you say 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.980
 at the beginning a boludo here you have this 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.230
 calling window 3d model can see the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.060
 3d model of the current shirt 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.060
 with that face click on the eye 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.000
 a great goal 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.350
 can see how it is going to be that if I 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.640
 First let's change it 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.640
 pants and stockings 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.450
 here it disappeared is normal because 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.760
 you just put a new image and what 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.100
 do the two green appointments are here 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.670
 refresh refresh the image 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.670
 and ready 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.069
 as you can see 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.760
 another thing 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.480
 in fifa 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.239
 T - shirt comes with mouth 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.239
 numbers like the numbers on the skirt 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.790
 and it already takes that says they are anvers we carry 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.790
 the numbers of the short T-shirt 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.120
 look like you 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.910
 first what I wanted to do is lower the 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.110
 number and name 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.890
 for that use if this is over bach 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.890
 that is the shield 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:00.860
 wagner is the name gold 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:04.239
 christian bach min and this you're just going to 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.239
 touch the one on top this 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.460
 up down then you lower it a little 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.509
 and down 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.080
 because he has to give an answer 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.080
 to update 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.480
 okay 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.480
 to take 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.370
 we go down 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.280
 Professor Layton Justito 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.100
 here they change at the source, these are not 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.750
 the numbers 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.750
 with which we want to put 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.979
 download can update 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.340
 once 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.180
 and they will play with whatever they want 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.180
 in a 6 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.580
 I always put here just in case fire 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:14.830
 save I do not know why the custom 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.830
 but I do not think it's necessary
