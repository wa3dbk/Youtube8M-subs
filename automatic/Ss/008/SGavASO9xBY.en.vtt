a tree tricky question because way back

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.260 
a tree tricky question because way back
when<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.560> didn't<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.520> many<00:00:32.820> video

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
good ones so Danny ones that were good I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
good ones so Danny ones that were good I

marketing<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.379> once<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.710> really

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
marketing and then once that really

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940 
marketing and then once that really
where<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.719> put<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> everyone<00:00:49.590> were

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
where you know put out to everyone were

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.040 
where you know put out to everyone were
the<00:00:50.129> good<00:00:50.340> games<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:52.170> now<00:00:53.420> like<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the good games so right now like the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
the good games so right now like the
marketing<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.710> everything<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> bit

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
marketing and everything is a bit

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
marketing and everything is a bit
cheaper<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.360> guess<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> there's<00:00:58.500> multiple

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
cheaper I guess and there's multiple

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.889 
cheaper I guess and there's multiple
ways<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.550> new<00:00:59.699> ways<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.270> games<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.840> there

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
ways and new ways to get games out there

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.299 
ways and new ways to get games out there
and<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.409> many<00:01:04.439> more<00:01:05.040> games

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and right now we get so many more games

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.580 
and right now we get so many more games
that<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.330> seems<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> quality<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that it seems like the quality of the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.899

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
magazine behind them and people buy them

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.969 
magazine behind them and people buy them
because<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> commercials<00:01:22.920> are

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
because they think the commercials are

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.510 
because they think the commercials are
cool<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> same<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.920> game<00:01:26.130> sucks

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
cool and at the same time the game sucks

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.870 
cool and at the same time the game sucks
so<00:01:26.850> nowadays<00:01:27.600> bad<00:01:28.229> games<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.799> more<00:01:29.040> attention

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so nowadays bad games get more attention

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.280 
so nowadays bad games get more attention
than<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> time<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.810> maybe

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
than they all the time so that's maybe

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.480 
than they all the time so that's maybe
the<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.650> thing<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> people<00:01:35.310> might<00:01:35.430> think

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the one thing that people might think

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.819 
the one thing that people might think
that<00:01:35.790> why<00:01:36.090> games<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.540> worse<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.350> now<00:01:37.560> but

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that why games are worse right now but

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.980 
that why games are worse right now but
in<00:01:38.070> reality<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.360> happening<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
in reality see what is happening is that

of cord basically they put out a new

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.690 
of cord basically they put out a new
code<00:04:16.310> every<00:04:16.609> year<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.770> they<00:04:18.770> just<00:04:18.980> don't<00:04:19.520> put

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
code every year and they just don't put

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.520 
code every year and they just don't put
that<00:04:19.730> much<00:04:20.000> effort<00:04:20.390> into<00:04:20.750> making<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.320> game

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that much effort into making the game

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.670 
that much effort into making the game
overall<00:04:22.370> better<00:04:22.820> but<00:04:23.600> they<00:04:23.870> knew<00:04:24.080> they<00:04:24.500> know

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
overall better but they knew they know

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.820
