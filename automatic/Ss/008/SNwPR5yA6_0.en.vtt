00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
email technology is clearly changing us

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
email technology is clearly changing us
and<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.390> connect<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.809> our<00:00:45.870> friends

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and the way we connect with our friends

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.680 
and the way we connect with our friends
our<00:00:46.620> families<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> world<00:00:47.730> around<00:00:48.030> us<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:53.690> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
our families in the world around us so I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
our families in the world around us so I
set<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> make<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.410> film<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
set out to make a film about what it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
set out to make a film about what it
means<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.940> connected<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> 21st

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
means to be connected in the 21st

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.990 
means to be connected in the 21st
century

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.479 

things<00:01:02.000> are<00:01:02.210> changing<00:01:02.720> there's<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.040> much<00:01:04.070> more

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
things are changing there's so much more

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.880 
things are changing there's so much more
to<00:01:04.640> think<00:01:04.850> about<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:06.320> pace<00:01:06.620> of<00:01:06.860> change

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
to think about and that pace of change

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.969 
to think about and that pace of change
is<00:01:07.370> only<00:01:07.610> accelerating<00:01:08.480> how<00:01:09.350> much<00:01:09.530> faster<00:01:09.770> can

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
is only accelerating how much faster can

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.740 
is only accelerating how much faster can
it<00:01:10.160> go<00:01:10.400> before<00:01:10.760> we<00:01:10.850> can't<00:01:11.120> keep<00:01:11.300> up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.600 

this<00:01:14.260> was<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.500> kind<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.860> question<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.460> was

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
this was the kind of question I was

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.300 
this was the kind of question I was
exploring<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.330> smell<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:17.080> then<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.070> had

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
exploring in the smell and then I had

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.830 
exploring in the smell and then I had
this<00:01:18.400> year<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.820> turned<00:01:19.090> my<00:01:19.210> world<00:01:19.360> upside

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
this year that turned my world upside

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.920 
this year that turned my world upside
down<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.220> forced<00:01:24.970> me<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.090> rethink<00:01:25.600> everything

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
down and forced me to rethink everything

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.510 
down and forced me to rethink everything
I<00:01:26.200> thought<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.440> understood<00:01:26.950> about<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.370> ways

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
I thought I understood about the ways

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.540 
I thought I understood about the ways
were<00:01:27.729> connected<00:01:34.800> we<00:01:35.800> as<00:01:35.920> humans<00:01:36.369> have

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
were connected we as humans have

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.160 
were connected we as humans have
accumulated<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.479> much<00:01:37.510> knowledge<00:01:39.930> why<00:01:40.930> do<00:01:40.990> we

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
accumulated so much knowledge why do we

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.810 
accumulated so much knowledge why do we
have<00:01:41.290> such<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.500> hard<00:01:41.800> time<00:01:41.890> seeing<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.580> bigger

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
have such a hard time seeing a bigger

00:01:42.820 --> 00:02:06.510 
have such a hard time seeing a bigger
picture

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.460 

for<00:02:07.090> centuries<00:02:07.420> we've<00:02:07.930> been<00:02:08.050> declaring

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
for centuries we've been declaring

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.009 
for centuries we've been declaring
independence<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:09.459> perhaps<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.450> time<00:02:10.750> to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
independence and perhaps it's time to

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.800 
independence and perhaps it's time to
finally<00:02:11.319> declare<00:02:11.920> our<00:02:12.160> interdependence

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.870 

you
