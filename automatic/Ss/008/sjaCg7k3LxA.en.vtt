00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 the karlsruher sc presents wildpark 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.809
 tv powered by bath tv because is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.519
 Eventually, every series will end for 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.019
 the ksc it was today after 20 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 unbeaten play with 1 2 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.699
 defeat at unterhaching what has it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 in your opinion was located 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.670
 In my view, we are quite unnecessary 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.390
 in the first half not at all 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 come game 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.570
 I do not know if it's a concentration 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.539
 was whether sap has nothing to do with the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.180
 to do attitude thus was from the beginning 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.370
 a little bit bewitched and if you are if 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.649
 one saw for the first time since 2002 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.149
 Light and shadow of the trainer in the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.649
 halfway yes that was there 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.180
 we have to be more aggressive that we better 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.350
 still have to come in the battles 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 Do not give up the ball that fast 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.730
 was the sticking point in the first one today 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 it is clear that you can not do everything at half-time 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.199
 times to force the luck then one runs 1 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.030
 0 afterwards and there it will be 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.590
 difficult it is on Wednesday evening in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.210
 learn further what can you do if 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 at all if you can take something 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.830
 You can do that today out of defeat 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.360
 yes you could take with you can 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.890
 them that we always play at the limit 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.909
 need and nothing yet 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.770
 is decided and that must be in the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.530
 Head in and have to go from week to week 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 and think of play and play 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 must now in the heads pure and is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.909
 nothing decided yet 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.650
 struggle for promotion probably clear 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.210
 we know what we can do we know how 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.420
 we played but we have to go now 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.909
 Just show it again and then 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.560
 on success full success followed 100 percent 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.659
 the first half is the decisive one 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.869
 every case i guess advertise totally 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.100
 missed lying back early 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.740
 they did not take place in the game 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 found and there chased 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.500
 second half it was okay then 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 have opened in the end that was just like 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.369
 then get that again was a pretty 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.439
 I can do that with the second time 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.060
 it was ok but still saw live 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.740
 that it is not enough just halfway 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 to play three or not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.490
 to really go into the game that that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.020
 do not land and I hope that now 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.909
 to the right newspaper 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.189
 you changed early after 20 minutes 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.390
 already that rather unusual yes me 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.100
 wait satisfied 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.940
 also had many ball losses from 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 just move from the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.060
 Room layout does not have that at all 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.979
 voted 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.020
 Some were not there and that's why 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.060
 but then it changed early 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.310
 because good that Wednesday already goes further 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.420
 yes I am glad that you are out of the game 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.040
 learns faster that it can 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.350
 It does not take that long with you 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.550
 has to lug around but that was 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.800
 that he can expand that again and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.220
 the catch-up game sibe founded the
