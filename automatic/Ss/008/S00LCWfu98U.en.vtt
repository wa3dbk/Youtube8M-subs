00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
description or whatever but probably was

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.660 
description or whatever but probably was
having<00:00:20.869> was<00:00:21.869> powering<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:23.250> progressively

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
having was powering up it progressively

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
having was powering up it progressively
got<00:00:23.699> had<00:00:23.970> gotten<00:00:24.150> worse<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.689> basically<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
got had gotten worse but basically it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.730 
got had gotten worse but basically it
started<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.510> turning<00:00:27.510> needed<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
started out as turning needed on and the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.330 
started out as turning needed on and the
green<00:00:29.310> light<00:00:29.519> would<00:00:29.670> flash<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:32.040> wouldn't

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
green light would flash and you wouldn't

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
green light would flash and you wouldn't
have<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> picture<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:32.940> away<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> sometimes

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
have a picture right away and sometimes

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
have a picture right away and sometimes
would<00:00:34.020> shut<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> off<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.250> turn<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
would shut it off and turn it on it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.560 
would shut it off and turn it on it
would<00:00:35.700> come<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.210> away<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.719> eventually

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
would come on right away and eventually

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
would come on right away and eventually
it<00:00:39.570> would<00:00:39.629> act<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.050> was<00:00:40.140> powering<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it would act like it was powering up but

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.549 
it would act like it was powering up but
you<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.780> green<00:00:42.780> power<00:00:42.960> light<00:00:43.079> blink

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you just see the green power light blink

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.430 
you just see the green power light blink
and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.239> wouldn't<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:46.079> turn

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and you know just wouldn't actually turn

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
and you know just wouldn't actually turn
on<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.710> far<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> picture<00:00:47.370> goes<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.180> think

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
on as far as the picture goes I think

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.130 
on as far as the picture goes I think
there<00:00:49.050> was<00:00:49.170> still<00:00:49.260> audio<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:51.140> mainly

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
there was still audio with it but mainly

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
there was still audio with it but mainly
the<00:00:52.440> concern<00:00:52.949> was<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> wasn't

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the concern was up that it wasn't

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.840 
the concern was up that it wasn't
letting<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> picture<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.850> did

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
letting up with a picture on it so did

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
letting up with a picture on it so did
old<00:00:56.940> research<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.660> particular<00:00:57.930> model

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
old research on this particular model

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.369 
old research on this particular model
and<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> seems<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.370> common<00:00:59.609> failure

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
and it seems to be a very common failure

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.700 
and it seems to be a very common failure
his<00:01:01.379> capacitors<00:01:02.100> fail<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.650> it's<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
his capacitors fail on it and it's a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.410 
his capacitors fail on it and it's a
very<00:01:04.769> common<00:01:05.220> thing<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:06.000> many<00:01:06.210> different

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
very common thing with many different

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.950 
very common thing with many different
electronics<00:01:07.070> for<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.729> fail<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.210> capacitors

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
electronics for that fail is capacitors

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.370 
electronics for that fail is capacitors
fail<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> port's<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.369> example<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:12.380> your

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
fail on the port's for example your your

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
fail on the port's for example your your
computer<00:01:13.560> motherboard<00:01:14.180> it's<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
computer motherboard it's one of the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
computer motherboard it's one of the
real<00:01:15.990> common<00:01:16.140> failures<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.040> them<00:01:17.159> you'll

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
real common failures with them you'll

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.469 
real common failures with them you'll
find<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.610> capacitors<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
find these capacitors are kind of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
find these capacitors are kind of
swollen<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:19.140> swelled<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> hard

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
swollen or swelled up it's kind of hard

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
swollen or swelled up it's kind of hard
to<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> video<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.110> these

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to see in the video here because these

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.080 
to see in the video here because these
are<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> big<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.520> hard<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> focus

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
are not that big and it's hard to focus

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
are not that big and it's hard to focus
in<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.360> my<00:01:24.509> camera<00:01:25.380> phone<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:28.340> anyhow

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
in with my camera phone here but anyhow

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060 
in with my camera phone here but anyhow
we<00:01:29.780> got<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> couple<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.439> could<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.860> are

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we got a couple and that I could see are

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.390 
we got a couple and that I could see are
visually<00:01:32.400> swollen<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
visually swollen this one this one this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.450 
visually swollen this one this one this
one<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.590> these

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
one and this one right down here these

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
one and this one right down here these
two<00:01:41.640> larger<00:01:42.000> ones<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.360> guess<00:01:42.509> they're<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.689> real

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
two larger ones I guess they're not real

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
two larger ones I guess they're not real
common<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.439> fail<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
common to fail I don't know if it's just

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.550 
common to fail I don't know if it's just
because<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> size<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.899> or<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.409> they

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
because the size one or what but they

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.039 
because the size one or what but they
seem<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.759> big<00:01:48.299> issue<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
seem to not be a big issue on the this

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.370 
seem to not be a big issue on the this
theater<00:01:49.350> model<00:01:49.649> anyway<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> ended<00:01:52.320> up

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
theater model anyway so I ended up

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.990 
theater model anyway so I ended up
buying<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> kit<00:01:52.829> off<00:01:52.979> eBay<00:01:53.310> cuz<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.700> was

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
buying a kit off eBay cuz it just was

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
buying a kit off eBay cuz it just was
easy<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> buy<00:01:54.659> all<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> capacitors<00:01:55.350> I

here<00:02:41.690> or<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.840> one<00:02:42.900> pick<00:02:43.500> up<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.710> little<00:02:43.830> bit<00:02:43.980> on

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
here or this one pick up a little bit on

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.200 
here or this one pick up a little bit on
the<00:02:44.160> camera<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.640> little<00:02:45.150> negative<00:02:45.600> sign<00:02:45.950> well

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
the camera a little negative sign well

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.250 
the camera a little negative sign well
that's<00:02:48.210> got<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> go<00:02:48.570> over<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> negative<00:02:49.080> side

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that's got to go over the negative side

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.410 
that's got to go over the negative side
you<00:02:49.950> know<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.220> flirty<00:02:50.460> specific<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.150> put<00:02:51.330> on

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
you know it's flirty specific you put on

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.810 
you know it's flirty specific you put on
backwards<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.920> passer<00:02:53.280> will<00:02:53.520> end<00:02:53.700> up

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
backwards the passer will end up

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.020 
backwards the passer will end up
basically<00:02:54.690> popping<00:02:55.260> it'll<00:02:55.860> it'll<00:02:56.640> burn<00:02:56.880> up

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
basically popping it'll it'll burn up

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.270 
basically popping it'll it'll burn up
and<00:02:57.210> pop<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.690> split<00:02:58.080> kind<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.130> you

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
and pop and split kind of like how you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.330 
and pop and split kind of like how you
swell<00:02:59.580> swell<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.740> gonna<00:03:01.800> basically

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
swell swell up but it's gonna basically

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
swell swell up but it's gonna basically
burn<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.850> up<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:03.960> gonna<00:03:04.110> smell<00:03:04.350> very

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
burn it up and it's not gonna smell very

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.640 
burn it up and it's not gonna smell very
nice<00:03:04.740> either<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:06.170> yeah<00:03:07.170> anyway<00:03:07.440> we're<00:03:07.590> gonna

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
nice either so yeah anyway we're gonna

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.400 
nice either so yeah anyway we're gonna
go<00:03:07.830> ahead<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.010> unsolder<00:03:08.520> these<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.410> replace

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
go ahead and unsolder these and replace

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.860 
go ahead and unsolder these and replace
them<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.970> know<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.240> back<00:03:12.420> side<00:03:12.660> here<00:03:12.780> you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
them you know on the back side here you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.360 
them you know on the back side here you
can<00:03:12.930> see<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.320> solder<00:03:13.650> contacts<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
can see a little solder contacts and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.710 
can see a little solder contacts and
everything<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.760> use<00:03:14.880> solder<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.510> heat<00:03:15.600> him

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
everything so we use solder and heat him

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.260 
everything so we use solder and heat him
up<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.220> pull<00:03:17.220> these<00:03:17.340> off<00:03:17.490> one<00:03:17.700> by<00:03:17.850> one<00:03:18.090> and

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
up and pull these off one by one and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.880 
up and pull these off one by one and
replace<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.260> see<00:03:19.440> how<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> goes

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
replace it and see how it goes

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.570 
replace it and see how it goes
see<00:03:20.340> if<00:03:20.430> any<00:03:20.580> fixes<00:03:20.970> TV<00:03:21.620> figured<00:03:22.620> worst-case

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
see if any fixes TV figured worst-case

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.610 
see if any fixes TV figured worst-case
scenario<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.180> still<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.690> broken<00:03:25.050> TV<00:03:25.230> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
scenario I still have a broken TV and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
scenario I still have a broken TV and
that's<00:03:26.310> exactly<00:03:26.670> what<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.000> started<00:03:27.300> with<00:03:27.450> so

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that's exactly what I started with so

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.310 
that's exactly what I started with so
it's<00:03:28.500> worth<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.770> shot<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:30.480> parts<00:03:30.840> only<00:03:30.960> cost

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
it's worth a shot the parts only cost

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.860 
it's worth a shot the parts only cost
like<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.010> think<00:03:32.760> was<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.060> twelve<00:03:33.450> thirteen

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
like I think was like twelve thirteen

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.320 
like I think was like twelve thirteen
bucks<00:03:34.110> or<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.740> all<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.190> capacitors<00:03:35.730> -<00:03:36.150> these

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
bucks or for all the capacitors - these

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.990 
bucks or for all the capacitors - these
two<00:03:36.600> right<00:03:36.810> here<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.830> anyhow<00:03:38.520> I'm<00:03:38.730> gonna<00:03:38.880> go

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
two right here so anyhow I'm gonna go

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.940 
two right here so anyhow I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.270> do<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:39.870> happens

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:04:14.910 

you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.099 

all<00:04:15.430> right<00:04:15.550> so<00:04:15.790> let's<00:04:15.910> plugged<00:04:16.209> in<00:04:16.359> red<00:04:16.900> lights

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
all right so let's plugged in red lights

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.100 
all right so let's plugged in red lights
on<00:04:17.760> turn<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:20.940> blinks

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
on turn it on blinks

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.149 
on turn it on blinks
let's<00:04:23.919> see<00:04:24.099> if<00:04:24.189> it<00:04:24.310> lights<00:04:24.490> up<00:04:25.740> its<00:04:26.740> lighten<00:04:26.979> up

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
let's see if it lights up its lighten up
