together<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:45.149> very<00:00:45.420> comfortable<00:00:45.780> works

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
together it's very comfortable works

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.560 
together it's very comfortable works
really<00:00:46.410> well<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.730> only<00:00:47.910> problem<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.480> only

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
really well the only problem it's only

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
really well the only problem it's only
two<00:00:48.750> problems<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> color

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
two problems with it one is the color

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.959 
two problems with it one is the color
it's<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.570> purplish<00:00:52.079> color<00:00:52.309> not<00:00:53.309> really

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it's the that purplish color not really

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
it's the that purplish color not really
the<00:00:54.120> red<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> look<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.260> interiors

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the red and if you look at my interiors

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.390 
the red and if you look at my interiors
a<00:00:55.860> lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:58.800> shows<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.180> I'm<00:01:01.670> red<00:01:03.019> red

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
a lot of that shows up but I'm red red

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.170 
a lot of that shows up but I'm red red
dark<00:01:05.400> red<00:01:05.489> blood<00:01:05.970> red

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
kind of color to it so the problem was

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
kind of color to it so the problem was
that<00:01:10.560> color<00:01:10.770> didn't<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.130> along<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.610> well<00:01:11.700> and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
that Levi's yeah I could take know if I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.460

could see bit of my hand anyway those

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.380 
could see bit of my hand anyway those
spins<00:02:16.710> real<00:02:16.920> nice<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.250> free<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.610> not<00:02:17.790> very

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
spins real nice and free is not very

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
spins real nice and free is not very
very<00:02:18.510> tiny<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.110> play<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.060> dripped

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
very tiny bit of play in it and dripped

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.510 
very tiny bit of play in it and dripped
a<00:02:21.120> couple<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.450> drops<00:02:21.660> oil<00:02:21.780> down<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.950> think

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
a couple of drops oil down and I think

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.270 
a couple of drops oil down and I think
that'll<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:23.880> fine<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.560> that's<00:02:25.800> gonna<00:02:26.010> go

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that'll be just fine so that's gonna go

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.240 
that'll be just fine so that's gonna go
right<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.720> take<00:02:27.930> its<00:02:28.080> place<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.710> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
right on the on take its place and I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.240 
right on the on take its place and I
think<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.880> one<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.150> gonna<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> single

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
think this one is gonna go in the single

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.950 
think this one is gonna go in the single
cab<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.000> don't<00:02:33.450> know<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.600> someone's<00:02:33.840> gonna

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
cab so I don't know if someone's gonna

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.800 
cab so I don't know if someone's gonna
ask<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.670> yeah<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.210> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> go<00:02:36.660> put

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
that on the single cab I think because

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.300 
that on the single cab I think because
it<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.270> comfortable<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:41.100> will

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
it is very comfortable and this will

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.400 
it is very comfortable and this will
match<00:02:41.460> my<00:02:41.490> interior<00:02:41.940> much<00:02:42.330> better<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.170> again

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
match my interior much better so again
