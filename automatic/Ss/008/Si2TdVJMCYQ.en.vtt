00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
 coincidence it is really pure coincidence 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
 it very many philosophy products as 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 first a mega bottle of cinnamon buns 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 and this is really my favorite shower gel 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.289
 I think I got it a year ago 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.640
 discovered and now I have the bad luck that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.990
 so my friend really likes it too 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 they both use it in the shower 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.779
 I already have a new bottle happy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.130
 because I really can 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 I ca n't go a day without it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 cinnamon buns 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 the smell is just like cinnamon 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 sandwiches really smell like cinnamon rolls 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 very nice warm smell and the shower you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.559
 himself is also very pleasant, he is very 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.850
 yes very creamy and very embarrassed 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 just high my skin also did not matter 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.539
 They are also very nice and you can follow me 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.070
 after each shampoo use yes but that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 I never actually do that but I can 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.680
 if you want so yes this is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.710
 I think half a liter 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.100
 then a big bottle of redeem through 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 I washed it with water so there 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 is still a bit in it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.619
 purity made simple this large bottle 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 the netherlands house not available i have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.360
 this one year ago really 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.760
 well almost exactly a year ago 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 I bought Chicago and I have to say that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 sometimes have it in between 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.659
 refilled with other bottles so he was 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 actually already on and you this is really mine 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.310
 favorite facial cleanser purity made 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.439
 simple one step facial cleanser 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.329
 because it cleans very gently and it does 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 little foam too and I like that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.130
 just super clean my skin 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 without leaving behind 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 leave 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.329
 and yes i have a purity made simple 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.200
 bottles 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.119
 I always have those travel bottles and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.510
 photo bank us big I have another 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.170
 smaller ones 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:54.960
 look for a yes here but I have to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.030
 just to smell for certainty 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.430
 yes two I was on vacation I had 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.430
 this filled with cinnamon buns it is one 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.990
 mini cinnamon buns and this whole 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.300
 small bottle there is really a drop 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.310
 in a delicious, very small bottle of 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.630
 purity made simple this super handy too 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.190
 because you can squeeze it 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.690
 so I will just refill this with 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.880
 the purity made simple that I get up now 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.590
 I always have backups of this so this one 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.480
 I keep bottles because these are such 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.940
 handy bottles for the road 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.710
 so yes much philosophy and there is still 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.440
 even more redeem bicycles 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.850
 namely a bottle of raspberry sorbet 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.550
 shower gel 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.500
 I did not find this myself so it is one 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.330
 nice shower gel but the smell is not so 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.800
 my thing 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.150
 well it just very sweet i like it one 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.160
 bit of double essence have a crack 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.450
 so not really a special smell and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.280
 my friend thought it was very tasty 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.000
 actually my friend made this up 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.220
 I just have five philosophy 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.530
 packaging 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.360
 then a bottle of powder keg nail polish 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.340
 remover without acetone 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.600
 I must always say that I am not whole 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.970
 very much difference between brand 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.910
 different brands of nail polish remover 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.410
 also got very expensive van vanium from them 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.330
 Rome but I would always like to hope 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.430
 simply the cheapest of powder kegs too 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.860
 because I have a lot of black nail polishes 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.989
 And yes then I have to be new all the time 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.550
 nail polish remover to my nail polish 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.019
 pick it up and I find that without met 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.390
 to do a whole deal and frankly 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.130
 so don't really notice the difference 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.019
 this is really something of two euros 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.570
 maybe not even in my opinion 150 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.700
 or a euro being the self is against it 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.250
 super good and large bottles of dernier 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.650
 micellar cleansing water and I had this 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.910
 been in use for a while and I have it 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.769
 now finally put up 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.600
 which I also have a review of my 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.280
 site and this is really a very nice one 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.040
 micellar water it just in the Netherlands 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.400
 in the drugstore can then buy a table 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.590
 are again the prodent fresh gel 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.660
 fine toothpaste but as always I have 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.420
 not really a toothpaste and then 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 now minute and 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:59.520
 of course vacation period and i am 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.510
 been on vacation in June June 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.250
 July 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.640
 and I'm a few times myself 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.910
 been somewhere else overnight 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.790
 nokia expert touch nail laquer remover 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.140
 so just nail polish remover mini bottle 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.680
 I keep this because it is handy to use 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.260
 refill and in mini-bottle 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.639
 markelo extra volume conditioner I sit 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.400
 I wonder if I will follow this in the following 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.229
 made up for not showing 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.970
 this one 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.889
 I think so yes what you like to me 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.419
 I have already said that 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.560
 didn't know how to get out 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.810
 to speak 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.500
 yes I have already shown this and one and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.180

 I think nourishing oil care shampoo 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.740
 I'm stuck a player but that is 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.740
 these little bottles have been absorbed 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.300
 I have a fragonard last month 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.530
 Slept in the Okura night and there 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.410
 so without this I didn't have them then 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.450
 but I used them when I last 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.590
 I had recordings for tlc in one 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.270

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.870

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.600
 Products

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.620

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.270
 nmi showergel are only packaging 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.350
 very awkward because you ca n't get there 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.970
 squeeze out and certainly the conditioner 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.580
 if you look at me this way you can't do it 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.530

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.539
