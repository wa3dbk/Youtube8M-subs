00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
were still open and I thought was a bit

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.609 
were still open and I thought was a bit
slow<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.729> took<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.630> go

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
slow so I took my time to actually go

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
slow so I took my time to actually go
into<00:01:10.970> multitasking<00:01:11.970> mode<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.479> Denise<00:01:12.810> um<00:01:13.050> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
into multitasking mode and Denise um the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
into multitasking mode and Denise um the
apps<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> were<00:01:14.100> running<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.549> try<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> stay

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
apps that were running to try and stay

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
apps that were running to try and stay
feeling<00:01:15.270> run<00:01:15.420> any<00:01:15.570> faster<00:01:16.190> so<00:01:17.190> that's<00:01:17.369> what

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
feeling run any faster so that's what

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
feeling run any faster so that's what
I'm<00:01:17.610> doing<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.259> as<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> lot<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I'm doing it as you can see a lot of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.680 
I'm doing it as you can see a lot of
people<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.490> been<00:01:20.520> playing<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690
