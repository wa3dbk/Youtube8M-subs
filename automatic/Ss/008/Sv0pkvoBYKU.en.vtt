00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 the woman suffers right beyond we have to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.250
 look the whole year for the body to stay 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.319
 in day after him china has to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 carry beach sunscreen creams 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.639
 for hair to water hair 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.070
 thermal because there's no way to drink 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 sun actually then gives three tips 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.789
 three different models of bag that will 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:30.300
 update your look leaves you super league 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:31.949
 Summer, good girl, we already spoke. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.690
 of the different bag formats are 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 super high season 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.870
 Now we're going to talk about fair and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.660
 that we can invest for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.579
 beach and pool, it's okay let's go there 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
 the threat management number one is that it has to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.030
 be a great bag that we will combine 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 no use wanting to do edited now 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.870
 carries the beach handbag will not fall 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.700
 the things you will want creams will have 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.770
 What to ask for a friend and while your 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.949
 favorite will have in the bathroom of home not 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.260
 robust is important 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.640
 keeping this in mind, I'm going to talk about three 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.399
 styles that I think we can one 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.369
 little number one style is one thing 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.950
 I tossed a little thing done by hand by 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.439
 example crochet has this face blurred 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 a more relaxed look is more hit 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.189
 super cool is very stylish shows that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.810
 Are you well with the vacation life? 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.810
 even this is the bag climate 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.100
 my number two suggestion is the purse 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.840
 transparent 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 she is super high up there toya womanly 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.679
 is even using to walk the street 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.929
 to hit the leg in the city on days 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.030
 normal even in winter but here in the 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.619
 brazil she is pumping on the beaches 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.149
 internally we called it a bag and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.549
 Rob, because you can see absolutely 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.009
 everything in it so it does not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.899
 forget to combine the bag of dengue 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.670
 Is Radiant With Canada A Little Bit 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.640
 bored here is personal play with the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.219
 Wow, that's fine, but not then. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 transparent bag but remember take care 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:02.670
 all that's inside he is on 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:05.490
 shows a pretty big brother girl number 3 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.649
 it 's nelson freire's purse a couple of 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.079
 some brands made clothes 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.060
 and snow dress that super rolled tap 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.590
 only started to use a bit but here in the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.819
 Brazil did not take so much of what is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.849
 Getting here in Brazil are the accessories. 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.560
 How is this good union and is it graces? 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.230
 so it 's great for the summer that we 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.910
 leaves in the morning in amenda in lunch and rep 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.860
 you can put in the sand after the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.400
 hit the hand she's ready for this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.400
 it's one of my favorites 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.610
 remembering that just like the bags 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.810
 it is also super important to think about the bic 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.360
 it suits you 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.340
 both their style and their biotype by 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.110
 This the geek word has already made a video 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.450

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.530
 get the bikini to port the body of the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.450
 Lala's wife that you will not be 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.370
