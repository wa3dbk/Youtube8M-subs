00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.930
 three reporters three experiments three 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.269
 Claims only one lies as printed 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.430
 jumbo with the waterbed story like 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.390
 You see, this waterbed is real 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.210
 tough 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 it keeps me out and even an 18 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.380
 tons of heavy armor 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.240
 61 percent believe that jumbo is the lie 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.480
 Is that correct ? 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.629
 you have fun now 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.109
 Let's start with the waterbed 18 tons 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.520
 weight 300 ps steel chains located in 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.760
 eat every floor 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
 a russian armored howitzer this 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.930
 monstrum should drive over a waterbed 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.899
 without what happens to the waterbed 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.550
 jumbo in addition to the weight, there is still something 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.829
 that will hurt the bed a lot 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.430
 the sharp chains that bite 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.430
 really 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.740
 sounds like a mission 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 impossible 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.800
 a tank over a waterbed that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.500
 works never works but I stand for it 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.980
 jumbo needs my word for that 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.660
 first of course a waterbed that 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.510
 standard model for two people together 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.030
 visit when a waterbed is 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.830
 a commercial waterbed 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.390
 anyone can get that home and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.619
 depending on body weight then with approx 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.470
 fill six to 700 liters of water ok 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.619
 700 liters are in it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.619
 cozy thing 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 the only thing that kind of thing 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.950
 can handle sharp objects 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.560
 curb chains, for example, as in ours 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.950
 try before small yes what happens 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.540
 if so big edged monster over 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.100
 drive water-filled objects 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.570
 look at rubbish 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 admitted that is not a waterbed but 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.330
 the principle is basically the same 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.790
 The ball is just as bulging as 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.160
 the bed so with a good margin 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.820
 the weight can not hurt the ball at first 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.860
 wear 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.390
 but someday one of the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.440
 sharp chain links the ball 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.970
 he bursts so it looks like if that 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.170
 material yields 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.459
 but i do not know a waterbed will 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.020
 give in that keeps the armor distracting 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.670
 Owner Mario Dancer will do that 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.810
 water bed this tank really 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.190
 withstand 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.190
 barely imaginable or 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.079
 Mario ready 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.260
 Mario will not drive extra carefully 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.299
 but equal to full throttle 18 tons 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.400
 on sharp chains against 700 liters in 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.920
 a plastic case can hold that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.670
 this waterbed really holds everything 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.379
 out of even this tank the 18 tons 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.419
 heavy armored howitzer with her 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.480
 massive and sheep to the chains 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:13.010
 Bed can not do anything 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.430
 waterbed really this burden 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.430
 withstand 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.010
 admitted the bed is not wide enough 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.379
 that the whole tank can roll over it 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.930
 but at least a chain gets caught 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.199
 bed full and thus at least nine 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.709
 tons of weight and completely safe 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.709
 remained 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.790
 Let's see the baby and then rock 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.240
 or the zipper is the envelope 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.130
 down 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.140
 but important is the core and looks 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 like new, it lets itself go 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.040
 to use this action again 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.680
 There you can see a tank again 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.740
 can not stop that easily but that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.400
 waterbed is still heal so me 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.400
 I said the truth
