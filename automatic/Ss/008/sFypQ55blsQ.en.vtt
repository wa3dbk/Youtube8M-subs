00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.830
 Hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.680
 today this video definitely 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.270
 we say singular if not unique since the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.000
 gameplay is the video game you are 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.590
 seeing at this moment I read the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 Lord of the Rings 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 in short, you can understand that on mine 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 channel was practically obligatory to do 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 exit a video presenting this 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 videogame as in short gameplay of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.230
 reference because in short 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.670
 let's stop for a moment and talk a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.710
 moment of my nickname I already have it 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.600
 explained what the meaning is but maybe 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.590
 it could be the case to reiterate it a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.680
 moment my nickname 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.899
 I read step 90 which often comes 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 abbreviated for convenience is nice I understand 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 because in short, I read the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.239
 same a few times maybe as a woody 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.010
 challenge to multiple times 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.360
 I repeat maybe one consecutively 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.199
 dozens of times like that I read the star 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.329
 more auction things 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.520
 at some point it is likely that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 tongue in the mouth vis incastri and moriate 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 suffocated so don't try it e 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.600
 however, it is often abbreviated 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.760
 as I read for convenience and therefore seen 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.439
 which I often get called I read was from 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 a lot of time that I told myself before or 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.780
 then on the channel I had to offer you a video 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.030
 which is based on video games by 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.799
 lego short, or I have left many 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 so many pirates of the Caribbean and all 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.720
 very nice because in any case Milan 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.030
 on a certain Milanese humor a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.560
 maybe dramatize what the un is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.780
 film or a certain situation 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 in short, for example, as the gentleman 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 of the rings there are situations and piquet 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.329
 but often with a peak colony but we are 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.590
 more than anything else naive comedy comes 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.990
 brought even enough fun 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 nice for those people who have 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.970
 in short, decided to approach this 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.700
 videogame here and then in short approve 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.189
 a video of the lego games was right 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 a must and I wanted to do it right for 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.790
 the fact that I often abbreviated mine 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.469
 nickname as I read but above all the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.570
 lord of the rings I read lord of the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.340
 rings and the perfect video game this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.130
 because why in my nickname 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.120
 for complete and legolas 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.940
 90 aside from the 90 that comes from 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.670
 fact that I was born in 1990 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.670
 I read the step was born at the time when 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.340
 I put 12 years you have to do a 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.920
 purchase on ebay for magic cards 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.690
 is meant and therefore I had to create me a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.500
 account on ebay I needed a 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.410
 nickname 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.180
 to which I thought then nickname nickname 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.930
 I will call you stefano stefani toe 45 and not 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.459
 it sucks 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.569
 yes actually I didn't think 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.220
 only gene however those that 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.110
 I was thinking they were doing very shit 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.790
 then I thought disk would place one from a 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.430
 my friend for saying okay i can't 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.790
 plagiarized now is what it would have been for a while 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.680
 of fantasy then at that time when 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.840
 wants melis I was not just come out 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.120
 the lord of the rings and less of europe 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.709
 senato a lot and therefore I said which is the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 it is not a name of a character from 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.579
 lord of the rings that can be fine 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.530
 with my name then jim lee stef no does 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.530
 shit degan from the step 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.980
 well 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.000
 no shit and then pd expects a 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:25.959
 moment legolas si legolas ends with s 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.430
 my name is stefano i could say legolas 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.200
 there was no evil laughter 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.769
 I come now to emphasize the whole 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.519
 point anyway there was born my nickname 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.799
 mag the step and therefore how in short i am 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.319
 I felt obliged to offer you a video that 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.380
 were I read the lord of the rings 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.010
 where in the water it is practically the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.930
 my nickname 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.690
 even between and so on it summarizes 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.500
 well what actually mine 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.329
 nick 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.709
 that's all here at the end 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.599
 this video simply this then 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.730
 I could tell you about the video game that 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.180
 in short, a video game that reads 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.129
 I had never played there before and I will be sincere 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.209
 is a very simple game 8 short, we 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.250
 the characters are each 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.170
 generally it goes on in teams 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.640
 everyone has a character from 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.680
 use this rather high 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.629
 each with its own characteristics e 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.910
 there is the one that can jump higher 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.220
 what the sword that can destroy 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.510
 in short, slightly construction and then 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.889
 it takes some teamwork to 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.539
 go ahead in the levels but not me 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.130
 I would dwell much more on these things 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.780
 in short, also because I sincerely think 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.710
 that as far as I read lord of the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.080
 rings is a video game 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.099
 now it is an obligatory purchase in short 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.240
 surely colors of profits will be great 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.700
 two hands 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.960
 I would like to say I would not like to a 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.060
 emphasize too much as this 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.550
 videogame or have been successful in 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.960
 our video ludica but that they are anyway 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.430
 crazy these video games I don't know about you 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.560
 boys better than little and the goliath 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.090
 I had to know something I confess to you 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.590
 when I went to my cousins ​​who 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.780
 they didn't know the fire station 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.020
 the police station at the airport 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.330
 they were all legos to give me cousins 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.190
 not so much to find them as everything goes 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.960
 no I couldn't wait to go to them 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.229
 can play lego don't tell him it is 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.090
 anyway okay anyway weight that 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.230
 I hope you all have some 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.900
 played the lake ea 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.550
 we are a game a game very much 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.890
 beautiful that plays in company is everything 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.540
 because what a lot then tell me and you 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.930
 maybe it's a mistake but you know what 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.540
 that is, even now that I am 22 years in the mid 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.790
 that is, I don't think the lego we say is a 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.320
 ageless game that is now if I had 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.000
 funds to go there to spend on that 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.790
 what with a lot to buy what I know 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.320
 something which I feared to mount 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.540
 would assume the things I step you a little 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.430
 nice time then maybe I'll be a 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.840
 still childish but many times me 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.690
 like to think of not being too much 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.610
 too overgrown for these things 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.530
 don't find yourself overwhelmed it's good to be a 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.910
 attached to those childish things 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.370
 they have grown a little and have us 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.900
 a little marked here from this video 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.400
 absolutely useless in quotation marks 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.720
 useless not a video is always me a lot 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.730
 this video is very useful and concrete 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.040
 simple since almost a thought 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.870
 interesting I'm like I like it 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.950
 this video on I like mode and so 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.260
 if you like it why not you too 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.450

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.620

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.460

 I love them with batons or with a purpose 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.010
 rumors in hand would have done him any 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.500
 and then with these final scenes in 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.500
 where sawan kicks ass in al 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.760
