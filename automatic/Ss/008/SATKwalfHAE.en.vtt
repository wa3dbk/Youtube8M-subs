worked<00:00:35.180> up<00:00:35.390> about<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.870> way<00:00:35.989> people<00:00:36.760> operated

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
worked up about the way people operated

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.490 
worked up about the way people operated
with<00:00:37.880> each<00:00:38.000> other<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.510> during<00:00:39.200> that<00:00:39.230> five

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
with each other and during that five

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.710 
with each other and during that five
years<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:40.070> just<00:00:40.340> started<00:00:40.550> writing<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.600> was

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
years I just started writing and I was

working<00:00:42.110> full-time<00:00:42.850> probably<00:00:43.850> more<00:00:43.970> than

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
working full-time probably more than

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.029 
working full-time probably more than
that<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:44.840> I'd<00:00:44.960> write<00:00:45.200> whenever<00:00:45.380> I<00:00:45.559> could<00:00:45.769> which

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
worked and because of that I started

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.930 
worked and because of that I started
changing<00:01:02.210> every<00:01:02.780> part<00:01:03.019> of<00:01:03.079> my<00:01:03.199> life<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:03.940> really

I faced certain obstacles and I had a

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.289 
I faced certain obstacles and I had a

lot of realizations you know one being
you<00:01:23.840> know<00:01:23.930> when<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.140> go<00:01:24.470> through

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
you know when you go through

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.450 
you know when you go through
catastrophic<00:01:26.119> illness<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:26.570> cancer

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
catastrophic illness like cancer

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.830 
catastrophic illness like cancer
sometimes<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.579> make<00:01:28.729> peace<00:01:28.969> with<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.659> I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
sometimes you make peace with that and I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.030 
sometimes you make peace with that and I
have<00:01:29.990> made<00:01:30.140> peace<00:01:30.350> with<00:01:30.409> death<00:01:30.680> when<00:01:30.979> I

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
have made peace with death when I

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.069 
have made peace with death when I
survived<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.670> second<00:01:31.969> time<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.360> made<00:01:32.869> peace

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
survived the second time I made peace

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.330 
survived the second time I made peace
with<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.680> realized<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.159> there<00:01:34.280> was

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
with it and I realized that there was

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.050 
with it and I realized that there was
nothing<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.729> fear<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.390> really<00:01:35.570> focuses<00:01:35.780> on

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
nothing to fear it really focuses on

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.370 
nothing to fear it really focuses on
just<00:01:38.060> discovering<00:01:38.479> lasting<00:01:38.840> happiness<00:01:38.960> and

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
just discovering lasting happiness and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.749 
just discovering lasting happiness and
fulfillment<00:01:39.799> which<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:40.009> think<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.460> most

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
fulfillment which I think that most

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.480 
fulfillment which I think that most
people<00:01:41.119> inherently<00:01:41.450> desire<00:01:41.899> in<00:01:42.020> life<00:01:42.049> I

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
people inherently desire in life I

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.010 
people inherently desire in life I
realize<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:43.520> throughout<00:01:44.450> my<00:01:44.539> life<00:01:44.810> that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
realize that throughout my life that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.420 
realize that throughout my life that
it's<00:01:45.140> not<00:01:45.289> one<00:01:45.649> big<00:01:45.680> thing<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.070> fixes

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
it's not one big thing that fixes

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.590 
it's not one big thing that fixes
everything<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.149> lot<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.360> little<00:01:47.509> things

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
everything it's a lot of little things

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.020 
everything it's a lot of little things
that<00:01:47.840> takes<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.740> lot<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.920> little<00:01:49.159> things<00:01:49.219> so

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
that takes a lot of little things so

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.219 
that takes a lot of little things so
it's<00:01:50.210> not<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.390> perfect<00:01:50.750> spouse<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.200> the

relationship you get out of it you get
right<00:04:48.400> back<00:04:48.520> into<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.880> same<00:04:49.000> kind<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.330> bad

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
right back into the same kind of bad

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.909 
right back into the same kind of bad
relationship<00:04:49.960> when<00:04:50.199> you<00:04:50.259> do<00:04:50.350> it<00:04:50.410> again<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
relationship when you do it again and

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.279 
relationship when you do it again and
again<00:04:50.979> until<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.430> figure<00:04:51.759> out<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.389> need

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
again until you figure out that you need

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.020 
again until you figure out that you need
to<00:04:53.380> learn<00:04:53.620> your<00:04:53.770> lesson<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.130> not<00:04:54.340> keep

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
to learn your lesson and not keep

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.460 
to learn your lesson and not keep
getting<00:04:55.330> better<00:04:55.479> relationships<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.259> think

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
getting better relationships and I think

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.110 
getting better relationships and I think
that<00:04:56.979> in<00:04:57.250> life<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:57.789> kind<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> same

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
that in life it's kind of the same

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.610 
that in life it's kind of the same
things<00:04:58.449> there<00:04:58.900> are<00:04:58.960> certain<00:04:59.259> things<00:04:59.289> that<00:04:59.470> we

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
things there are certain things that we

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.260 
things there are certain things that we
have<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.889> learn<00:05:00.009> and<00:05:00.310> now<00:05:00.849> either<00:05:01.030> be

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
have to learn and now either be

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.580 
have to learn and now either be
presented<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.750> us<00:05:01.780> through<00:05:02.050> illness<00:05:02.229> through

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
presented to us through illness through

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.589 
presented to us through illness through
people<00:05:03.490> in<00:05:03.580> our<00:05:03.610> life<00:05:03.820> through<00:05:04.180> betrayal

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
people in our life through betrayal

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.140 
people in our life through betrayal
through<00:05:05.110> work<00:05:05.740> but<00:05:06.250> we<00:05:06.520> will<00:05:06.699> face<00:05:06.880> those

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
through work but we will face those

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.730 
through work but we will face those
things<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:08.020> think<00:05:08.050> they<00:05:08.259> get<00:05:08.380> harder<00:05:08.680> and

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
things and I think they get harder and

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.170 
things and I think they get harder and
harder<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:09.070> face<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.610> longer<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.090> longer

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
harder to face the longer and longer

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.330 
harder to face the longer and longer
