it's the legit seal just by that little
flap<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.320> NES<00:02:31.650> games<00:02:32.010> you're<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
flap but for NES games you're going to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.960 
flap but for NES games you're going to
look<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:34.070> usually<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.280> almost<00:02:35.459> always<00:02:35.760> this

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
look for usually it's almost always this

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.610 
look for usually it's almost always this
h<00:02:36.209> seal<00:02:36.480> at<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> back<00:02:36.780> horizontal<00:02:37.440> seal

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
h seal at the back horizontal seal

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.560 
h seal at the back horizontal seal
that's<00:02:37.770> pretty<00:02:38.100> damn<00:02:38.280> straight<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.420> this

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
that's pretty damn straight but this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.970 
that's pretty damn straight but this
side<00:02:39.810> seal<00:02:40.140> there<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.830> how<00:02:40.920> that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
side seal there you can see how that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.050 
side seal there you can see how that
kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> curls

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
kind of curls

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.820 
kind of curls
where<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.810> comes<00:02:42.959> together<00:02:43.200> it's<00:02:43.620> not<00:02:43.800> a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
where it comes together it's not a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.260 
where it comes together it's not a
perfect<00:02:44.220> 90<00:02:44.370> degree<00:02:44.700> angle<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.209> a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
perfect 90 degree angle if it's a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.640 
perfect 90 degree angle if it's a
perfect<00:02:45.570> 90<00:02:45.750> degree<00:02:45.810> angle<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.350> probably

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
perfect 90 degree angle it's probably

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.470 
perfect 90 degree angle it's probably
done<00:02:46.739> by<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> more<00:02:47.130> recent<00:02:47.340> machine<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> it's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
done by a more recent machine and it's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.140 
done by a more recent machine and it's
probably<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.050> fake<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.820> one<00:02:51.000> way<00:02:51.120> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
probably a fake so that's one way to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.270 
probably a fake so that's one way to
tell<00:02:51.420> with<00:02:51.600> NES<00:02:52.050> games<00:02:52.350> also<00:02:52.830> you're<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
tell with NES games also you're going to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.270 
tell with NES games also you're going to
want<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.459> look<00:02:53.610> at<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> top<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.360> box

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
want to look at the top of the box

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.650 
want to look at the top of the box
normally<00:02:56.280> every<00:02:56.550> single<00:02:56.790> time<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:56.970> open<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
normally every single time you open the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.110 
normally every single time you open the
game<00:02:57.870> some<00:02:58.739> paint<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.220> fly<00:02:59.459> off<00:02:59.670> basically

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
game some paint will fly off basically

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.110 
game some paint will fly off basically
it's<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.720> minor<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:02.400> you're<00:03:02.700> opening<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it's so minor but if you're opening the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.479 
it's so minor but if you're opening the
flap<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.750> flap<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.130> first<00:03:05.340> time

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
flap the flap is going to the first time

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.190 
flap the flap is going to the first time
especially<00:03:05.700> cause<00:03:06.330> some<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.900> paint<00:03:07.110> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
especially cause some of the paint to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.320 
especially cause some of the paint to
chip<00:03:07.380> off<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.280> look<00:03:08.459> at<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> looks

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
chip off so look at that and if it looks

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.630 
chip off so look at that and if it looks
really<00:03:09.570> nice<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.050> flush<00:03:10.320> then<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.950> probably

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
really nice and flush then it's probably

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.280 
really nice and flush then it's probably
more<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.150> sealed<00:03:12.390> game<00:03:12.660> or<00:03:12.900> at<00:03:13.020> least<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
can be more sure but then I get into n64

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
n64 games that I don't even keep track

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.020 
of them this one has like the vertical
seal<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.650> since<00:03:26.190> there's<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.519> many<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:26.940> so

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
seal but since there's so many it's so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.460 
seal but since there's so many it's so
hard<00:03:27.209> for<00:03:27.330> me<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.510> tell<00:03:27.720> because<00:03:27.959> they<00:03:28.200> did

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
hard for me to tell because they did

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.199 
hard for me to tell because they did
vary<00:03:28.739> sometimes<00:03:29.430> when<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.790> games<00:03:29.970> are

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
vary sometimes when the games are

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.930 
vary sometimes when the games are
actually<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:31.370> Mexico<00:03:32.370> when<00:03:32.610> they're<00:03:32.730> made

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
actually in Mexico when they're made

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.370 
actually in Mexico when they're made
they<00:03:33.330> have<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> different<00:03:33.810> seal<00:03:33.989> than<00:03:34.260> when

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
they have a different seal than when

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.750 
they have a different seal than when
they're<00:03:34.470> made<00:03:34.590> other<00:03:34.769> places<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.580> hard

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
they're made other places so it's hard

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.420 
they're made other places so it's hard
to<00:03:35.820> tell<00:03:36.320> but<00:03:37.320> for<00:03:37.530> GameCube<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:37.980> Wii<00:03:38.070> games

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
