00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.589
 if there is international football then it is 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.490
 still nice to practice games 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.670
 can play 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950
 psv a1 did that against the promise of kv 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 Mechelen and international football means 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.190
 also that players are gone 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.109
 because it does not apply to mohammed radji 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 with the first action and the first 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 goal attempt of the match on the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.320
 fell off the bar last week 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 who is still on because of his red card now 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 with the first chance and this is alexander 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.219
 Jacobsen and he puts PSV ahead 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 the part of origin midfielder plays 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.370
 with back number 11 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 pull mark from left to inside and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.520
 with right swipe and goalkeeper buttocks 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.379
 does not look good anyway on psv 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 lead and the rest earned because the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.980
 team plays aggressively under leadership 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 from mohammed rafi here again with the good ones 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 watch action think maria but the bar 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 is still in the way and there it is again 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.969
 aldo gone through antonio 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 that PSV soon after the opening goal 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.570
 206 good attack via radji construction 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 intercepted 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.430
 maria has bad luck but alberto antonio 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.430
 to score double 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.509
 what can kv mechelen also the group that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.009
 in the Belgian competition for 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.009
 teams still managed to compete 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.990
 but also with a lot here 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.450
 youth players take on as in rieke 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.729
 good action and he has bad luck because 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.729
 certain brings salvation for psv 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.090
 [Music] 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.439
 one of the few moments that kv 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.009
 playing mechelen 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.229
 if first half this is jacob them again 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.869
 keeps the overview foot to maria 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.670
 which aims to determine the angle but 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.770
 shot to be blocked and therefore one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 corner kick 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.799
 clint leemans in turning from the right 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.330
 and antonio with the head is already good 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.050
 placed after the far corner 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.970
 saves a few centimeters in the second 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.920
 half a lot of bills and a wrong one 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.960
 width easter and therefore kv mechelen 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.259
 take over but kardash 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.020
 helps a hand in and passes 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.390
 Another substitute goalkeeper Jesse Bertrams 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.240
 with a backward header 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.980
 that indicates poor communication 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.620
 misunderstanding between the back 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.840
 kv mechelen suddenly joins in again 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.400
 thanks to carders 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 who passes bertrams 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.840
 but the Belgians really do n't get there anymore 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 to pass as PSV go hunting and here 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.740
 had to bait anonymous to get the chance 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.760
 but the precision just misses the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.760
 wrong side of the pole 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.420
 who videos zinga 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.490
 attentive viewer on the right 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.860
 and kv mechelen think that it can be done quietly 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.950
 build up but sam 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.270
 hunts foot and intercepts and then gets 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.590
 another chance and now along the 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.590
 wrong side of the pole 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.320
 but such an oh knows he won't last too long 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.180
 must grieve and that hunting helps and also 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.950
 this 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.110
 van ransbeeck raid goalkeeper delivers 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.580
 just get into radji and you don't have to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.470
 to do 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.860
 the man with number 10 remains intact 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.860
 controlled 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:28.480
 az psv on three one the margins so again 2 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:33.160
 and that's well deserved hunting 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.430
 effect and radji 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.430
 scores 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370
 the Belgians have learned from them 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 way of building 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.740
 no, because van vlerken here conquers the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.319
 ball then comes a collision marathi mag 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.709
 by the cross is custom moon matters 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.080
 actually does everything well but retains it 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.040
 then does not control the rest on the ball 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.340
 tapping inside 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.910
 big chance to go four that is it 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.140
 not 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.739
 [Music] 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.739
 psv a1 wins with three one from kv mechelen
