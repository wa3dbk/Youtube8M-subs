am<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.470> hunter<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.860> i<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.280> particularly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
choice when only gonna have the two

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
choice when only gonna have the two
candidates<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.220> i<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> choice<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
