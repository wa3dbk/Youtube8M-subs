to help support those my first reactions
to<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.660> shots<00:00:44.559> up<00:00:45.100> they<00:00:45.850> were<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:46.239> bit

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
to the shots up they were a bit

to the shots up they were a bit
interesting<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:47.350> figured<00:00:48.039> an<00:00:48.219> excavator<00:00:48.699> in<00:00:48.940> a

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
interesting I figured an excavator in a

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.819 
interesting I figured an excavator in a
china<00:00:49.480> shop<00:00:49.570> was<00:00:49.960> going<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> be<00:00:50.379> quite<00:00:50.620> awkward

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
china shop was going to be quite awkward

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:51.599 
china shop was going to be quite awkward
and<00:00:51.190> weird

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
and weird

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.340 
and weird
I<00:00:51.640> thought<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.629> approach<00:00:52.929> was<00:00:53.109> pretty

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
I thought the approach was pretty

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.040 
I thought the approach was pretty
aggressive<00:00:53.589> I<00:00:54.010> was<00:00:54.760> intrigued<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.960> excited

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
aggressive I was intrigued and excited

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
aggressive I was intrigued and excited
about<00:00:56.500> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
about it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.000 
about it
it's<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.539> crazy<00:00:58.929> concept<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.559> think<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.890> a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
it's a crazy concept to think of a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's a crazy concept to think of a
excavator<00:01:00.820> in<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.089> china<00:01:01.329> shop<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:01.929> we<00:01:02.589> proved

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
excavator in a china shop but we proved

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.819 
excavator in a china shop but we proved
that<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.730> capable<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.320> can<00:01:05.470> pick<00:01:05.619> up

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
that it's capable and it can pick up

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.460 
that it's capable and it can pick up
fine<00:01:06.070> china<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.810> perform<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.900> task<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.380> not

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
fine china and perform the task and not

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.740 
fine china and perform the task and not
be<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.680> bull<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.340> china<00:01:09.369> shop<00:01:09.640> there<00:01:10.509> was<00:01:10.600> some

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
be a bull in a china shop there was some

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.929 
be a bull in a china shop there was some
pretty<00:01:10.960> creative<00:01:11.320> minds<00:01:11.860> working<00:01:12.700> on<00:01:12.820> these

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
pretty creative minds working on these

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.340 
pretty creative minds working on these
projects<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.750> they<00:01:13.840> had<00:01:13.990> some<00:01:14.200> interesting

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
projects and they had some interesting

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.670 
projects and they had some interesting
ideas<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.390> had<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.659> kind<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.960> rein<00:01:17.439> them

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
ideas so we had to kind of rein them

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.380 
ideas so we had to kind of rein them
back<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.250> let<00:01:18.399> them<00:01:18.610> know<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:18.790> it's<00:01:19.180> not

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
back and let them know that it's not

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.020 
back and let them know that it's not
physically<00:01:19.930> possible<00:01:20.409> for<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:21.399> machine<00:01:21.820> to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
physically possible for this machine to

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.780 
physically possible for this machine to
do<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.360> task<00:01:22.689> so<00:01:23.079> they<00:01:24.009> did<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.220> good<00:01:24.369> job<00:01:24.430> of

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.670 
do this task so they did a good job of
referencing<00:01:25.360> us<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.780> asking<00:01:26.079> our<00:01:26.229> opinions

was<00:02:08.670> phenomenal<00:02:09.049> being<00:02:10.049> able<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> put<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> piece

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
was phenomenal being able to put a piece

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.320 
was phenomenal being able to put a piece
of<00:02:10.769> equipment<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.580> china<00:02:11.819> shop<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
of equipment in a china shop and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.390 
of equipment in a china shop and
maneuver<00:02:13.049> around<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.470> way<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.620> did<00:02:13.950> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
maneuver around the way it did the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.699 
maneuver around the way it did the
fine-tuning<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.720> capabilities<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
fine-tuning and the capabilities of the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.180 
fine-tuning and the capabilities of the
swing<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:18.150> travel<00:02:18.989> speed<00:02:19.140> being<00:02:19.920> able<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
swing and the travel speed being able to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.559 
swing and the travel speed being able to
maneuver<00:02:20.430> through<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.940> tight<00:02:21.120> spaces

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
maneuver through the tight spaces

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.660 
maneuver through the tight spaces
because<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.049> literally<00:02:22.349> only<00:02:22.500> had<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
because we literally only had like a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.130 
because we literally only had like a
half<00:02:23.940> an<00:02:24.060> inch<00:02:24.239> on<00:02:24.329> each<00:02:24.510> side<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> machine

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
half an inch on each side of the machine

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.800 
half an inch on each side of the machine
and<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.680> being<00:02:25.890> able<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.129> move<00:02:26.790> slowly<00:02:27.120> find

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and so being able to move slowly find

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.650 
and so being able to move slowly find
movements<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.010> wasn't<00:02:29.190> jerky<00:02:29.700> otherwise

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
movements and it wasn't jerky otherwise

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.860 
movements and it wasn't jerky otherwise
we<00:02:31.110> would<00:02:31.230> had<00:02:31.410> China<00:02:31.860> all<00:02:31.980> over<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> place<00:02:32.870> in

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
we would had China all over the place in

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.199 
we would had China all over the place in
the<00:02:34.379> china<00:02:34.620> shop<00:02:34.709> yeah<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:35.730> did<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:35.940> few

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
the china shop yeah I think we did a few

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.180 
the china shop yeah I think we did a few
things<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.660> made<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.290> hopefully<00:02:37.950> seem<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
things that made it hopefully seem a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.599 
things that made it hopefully seem a
little<00:02:38.459> more<00:02:38.640> dramatic<00:02:39.920> yes<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.129> machine<00:02:41.489> is

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
little more dramatic yes this machine is

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.520 
little more dramatic yes this machine is
completely<00:02:42.030> capable<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.290> fine

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
completely capable of the fine

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.559 
completely capable of the fine
maneuverability<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.489> tracking<00:02:45.120> through<00:02:45.540> a

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
maneuverability of tracking through a

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.170 
maneuverability of tracking through a
china<00:02:46.560> shop<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.579> is<00:02:47.609> absolutely<00:02:48.000> built

china shop and it is absolutely built
for<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.720> many<00:02:49.560> other<00:02:49.769> things
