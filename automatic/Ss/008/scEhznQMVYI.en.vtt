00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
it's hurt my fingers a lot like this was

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.699 
it's hurt my fingers a lot like this was
this<00:03:00.510> took<00:03:00.720> some<00:03:00.870> work<00:03:01.080> cutting<00:03:01.380> out<00:03:01.530> this

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
this took some work cutting out this

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.350 
this took some work cutting out this
cutting<00:03:02.190> out<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> heart<00:03:02.430> was<00:03:02.910> kind<00:03:03.300> of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
cutting out the heart was kind of

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.550 
cutting out the heart was kind of
difficult<00:03:03.720> because<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.050> cardboard<00:03:04.440> was

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
difficult because the cardboard was

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.470 
difficult because the cardboard was
really<00:03:04.770> thick<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.550> was<00:03:05.760> tricky<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.330> then

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
really thick so that was tricky and then

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
really thick so that was tricky and then
twisting<00:03:07.110> all<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> coffee<00:03:07.590> filters<00:03:08.010> kind<00:03:08.280> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
twisting all the coffee filters kind of

thing<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:41.680> did<00:04:41.920> I<00:04:41.950> don't<00:04:42.220> even<00:04:42.310> want<00:04:42.490> to

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
thing that I did I don't even want to

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.980 
thing that I did I don't even want to
say<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.940> made<00:04:43.120> this<00:04:43.270> because<00:04:43.630> it's<00:04:43.840> really

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
say that I made this because it's really

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.450 
say that I made this because it's really
not<00:04:44.830> much<00:04:45.070> at<00:04:45.280> all

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
not much at all

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.110 
not much at all
I<00:04:45.700> had<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.570> candle<00:04:47.020> sitting<00:04:47.260> on<00:04:47.410> our<00:04:47.820> our<00:04:48.820> TV

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
I had this candle sitting on our our TV

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.610 
I had this candle sitting on our our TV
stand<00:04:49.330> thing<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.870> candle<00:04:50.170> inside<00:04:50.290> is

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
stand thing but the candle inside is

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.500 
stand thing but the candle inside is
orange<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.310> just<00:04:51.490> thought<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.180> looked<00:04:52.300> like

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
orange and I just thought it looked like

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.020 
orange and I just thought it looked like
Follies<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.170> a<00:04:53.200> fall<00:04:53.410> handle<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.730> I<00:04:54.790> want<00:04:54.940> to

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
Follies like a fall handle so I want to

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.340 
Follies like a fall handle so I want to
cover<00:04:55.180> up<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.390> orange<00:04:55.660> color<00:04:55.870> because<00:04:56.230> it

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
cover up the orange color because it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.570 
cover up the orange color because it
really<00:04:56.530> doesn't<00:04:56.680> go<00:04:56.890> with<00:04:57.040> like<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.250> season

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
