00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and I know it's a little bit a little

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.519 
and I know it's a little bit a little
blurry<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> want<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.380> go<00:00:22.500> with

blurry just because I want to go with
the<00:00:22.859> macro<00:00:23.220> view<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.760> show<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.090> detail

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the macro view so I can show some detail

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.890 
the macro view so I can show some detail
with<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.810> case<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.939> say<00:00:27.180> well<00:00:27.660> first

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
with this case I have to say well first

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
with this case I have to say well first
off<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> fan<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> leather<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.550> leather

type<00:00:30.029> cases<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.099> being<00:00:32.340> said

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
type cases for one but that being said

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.299 
type cases for one but that being said
if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:33.930> leather<00:00:34.079> cases<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.800> leather

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
if you do like leather cases or leather

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.830 
if you do like leather cases or leather
type<00:00:35.670> cases<00:00:35.969> because<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.480> actually<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
type cases because this is actually a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.869 
type cases because this is actually a
green<00:00:37.200> case<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.700> real

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
green case so it's not actually real

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.049 
green case so it's not actually real
leather<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.780> probably<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> best<00:00:40.620> option

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
leather this is probably the best option

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.080 
leather this is probably the best option
it's<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.600> solid<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's very very solid as you can see the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
it's very very solid as you can see the
stitching<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.350> very<00:00:46.350> solid<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> goes<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
stitching is very solid it goes all the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.029 
stitching is very solid it goes all the
way<00:00:47.340> around<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.960> corners<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> very

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
way around on the corners this is a very

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.830 
way around on the corners this is a very
solid<00:00:50.489> case<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> main<00:00:51.360> things<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.600> like

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
solid case one of the main things I like

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
solid case one of the main things I like
about<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.140> case<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.340> drop<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
about this case is you drop it like this

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
about this case is you drop it like this
your<00:00:54.750> screen<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.320> fun<00:00:55.500> because

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
your screen is going to be fun because

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.910 
your screen is going to be fun because
it<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.930> essentially<00:00:57.930> padding<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:58.500> around

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it has essentially padding all around

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
it has essentially padding all around
the<00:00:58.980> screen<00:00:59.510> second<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the screen second of all I like this

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830 
the screen second of all I like this
little<00:01:02.399> mess<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
little mess you can see over the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
little mess you can see over the
speakers<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> microphone<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
speakers in the microphone here that you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
speakers in the microphone here that you
know<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> keeps<00:01:06.869> lint<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.500> stuff<00:01:08.100> like

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
know kind of keeps lint out stuff like

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.510 
know kind of keeps lint out stuff like
that<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> awesome<00:01:10.010> thirdly<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.310> main

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
that which is awesome thirdly the main

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
that which is awesome thirdly the main
thing<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.689> this

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
thing I really really like about this

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
thing I really really like about this
case<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.290> would<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> reason<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
case this would be a reason to get it is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.200 
case this would be a reason to get it is
a<00:01:14.790> normal<00:01:15.330> plastic<00:01:15.600> case<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> iphone

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
a normal plastic case for the iphone

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.609 
a normal plastic case for the iphone
when<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.299> take<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> case<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.049> you'll<00:01:19.290> notice

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
when you take the case off you'll notice

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
when you take the case off you'll notice
that<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.220> corners<00:01:20.880> it's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that on the on the corners it's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
that on the on the corners it's
scratched<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.229> dust<00:01:22.590> sand

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
scratched up because you know dust sand

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160 
scratched up because you know dust sand
any<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> grit<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.509> imagine<00:01:24.750> gets

any kind of grit you can imagine gets

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
any kind of grit you can imagine gets
caught<00:01:25.470> inside<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.280> corners<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> case

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
caught inside the corners of that case

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.170 
caught inside the corners of that case
well<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.490> soft

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
well because this one is actually soft

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
well because this one is actually soft
on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> inside<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> happen

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
on the inside it's not going to happen

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.560 
on the inside it's not going to happen
you're<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> scratching

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you're not going to have it scratching

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.640 
you're not going to have it scratching
or<00:01:33.659> rubbing<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:33.960> against<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.290> case<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.560> the
