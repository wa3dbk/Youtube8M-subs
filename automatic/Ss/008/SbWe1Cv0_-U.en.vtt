00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.290
 so 88 deputies decided the fate 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.650
 million today in Gazprom took in 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.220
 first reading law which is completely 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.419
 prohibits the use of 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.669
 alcohol driving surprisingly only 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:11.839
 what's in the room at the time of voting 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.240
 there were 88 people instead of four 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.260
 fifty 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.090
 equation with unknowns solved 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.099
 Valentin Kalashnik 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.460
 today all media 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 reported that the State Duma 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.470
 banned drinking and driving canceled earlier 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.769
 allowed 0 3 ppm is not 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 quite accurate however the decision 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.669
 really have but understood him 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.559
 non-state and what is left of it 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.120
 after lunch the thing is that at the moment 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.730
 voting in the hall was only 88 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 four hundred deputies 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.160
 fifty 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.370
 This is what a truly active person looks like. 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.580
 lawmaking work alone physically 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.930
 strong deputy has time to vote 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.240
 press 9 but until the deputies are older 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.480
 are responsible for a smaller sector if 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.980
 divide the number of votes and the number 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.960
 present 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.220
 it turns out that one on average vote for 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.930
 five is the main place of work 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.060
 On this deputy receives salary 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.810
 fee and complaints to travel many 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.260
 important meetings 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.210
 he may be helpful 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.030
 Of course, the reason for not attending 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 plenary sessions to get rid of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.650
 from dead souls and force deputies 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.590
 voting is enough to accept 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.930
 amendment to the parliamentary practice 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.480
 showed that such a decision can be made 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.820
 time was shown behind it 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.990
 make other laws such as 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.820
 requires daily adjustment 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.870
 we have because of the rush Aleksich for all 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.200
 respect for the leadership of a single 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.880
 Russia 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.509
 on the 7 percent agenda we will look at one and 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.930
 same question called about making 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.420
 changes 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.110
 you let's not rush 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.810
 adoption of laws to reduce us 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 agenda minus 30 single issue 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.049
 at least five seven but discuss them 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.600
 finally thoroughly 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.040
 fundamentally so that there is no sweat 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.600
 Amendments Title Amending 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.619
 that law which with nothing yesterday the law of 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440
 the permissible dose of alcohol is one of those 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.990
 rare quickly and without opinion 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.059
 the opposition 

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:55.909
 new law today introduced to colleagues 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.069
 United Russia Alexander Moskalets he told 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.829
 how many people died and it's liberal 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.939
 amendments to the question of who was the pastor 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.119
 of that dangerous law answered 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.389
 and even purchased just don't remember who 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.500
 was the author but I don't think it's a little 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.529
 barely had to kill 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.609
 It turned out that Moskalets honestly forgot 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.479
 that he himself defined the law two years ago 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.839
 chose him immediately reminded covered up 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.659
 who were in Russia 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.489
 Vladimir Abdualiyevich 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.310
 Moskalets Alexander Petrovich about Oleg 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.060

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 people for this 314 deputies 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.469
 I must tell you that the products 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.429
 Communist Party Fair Russia LDPR 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.159
 voted all against today all 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.969
 voted unanimously on the scoreboard 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.889
 the figure for 449 caught fire 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.009
 Oleg Frost allowed himself to joke 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.089
 about this, that is, he will be unanimous 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.729
 voting 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
 as a result 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.509
 but someone one region out of the room someone 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:56.979
 came out apt 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.439
 I know who came out because I will say who is higher 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.019
 last yearâ€™s level 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.409
