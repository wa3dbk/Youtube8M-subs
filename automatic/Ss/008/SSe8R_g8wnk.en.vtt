00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.919
 not for speed shift is back and how 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.800
 this time went for it offers its many neon lights but ignorance 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 and especially a lot of challenge 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.899
 here 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.179
 electronic arts the arcade like this thrown overboard 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.030
 and in its place a simulation results that were almost put in front of the choir 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.489
 one that can even compete with toppers as a pro is beautiful forza 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.410
 the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.730
 has been a stop signal there have been so many dimple elements that are equally 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.470
 to be close to the reality of life and death in front of the class 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.910
 but here and there slightly mad studios is a bit artistic 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.960
 freedom 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.100
 to make the game playable 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 for example, the design of itself is not very realistic 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 who gets celebrated first in the top ten and not for speed world tour event 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.159
 presented and all subdivided into different race types and tournaments 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.060
 the race types consist of sky files your borders 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 tom de mul rather the standard races and drift 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 fiercely 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.330
 next to the british 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.770
 However, players can quite quickly between many different is typical 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.200
 choose and there is not really a solid structure 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 So here is clearly what work kerviel approach is chosen 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.940
 but the racing itself is fortunately anything but this one 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.740
 it is found not far speed shift can perfectly compare with that of the top 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.500
 the genre 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.900
 Once you are on the job in a book that he has a lot and then you immediately know what 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900
 we mean 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.319
 the cars respond to these movements precisely and allow themselves to be steered 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.159
 just as they would in real life 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.430
 they have even made it precise that the part is drifting for the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.430
 less experienced racers is particularly difficult 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.629
 while driving, the racing feeling becomes even stronger thanks to the fantastic cockpit 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.239
 view 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.319
 this should be the textbook example for all other racing games 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.640
 The viewing angle is good for your mirrors are clearly visible and you never have 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.169
 the feeling that the game becomes well-organized 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.709
 while driving with the camera constant making it look like you 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.149
 however, suffer from the heavy g forces 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:59.269
 the cars are still very good to drive at high speeds, it is clear that the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.579
 makers have made the game slightly more accessible for games that are few 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.579
 have experience with simulation racing 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.149
 yet 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 9 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.439
 no one needs to worry that he will not be bothered 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.009
 or through a cleverly designed skills system 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.759
 This gives the points on two extremes in the racing behavior aggression and precision 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.969
 because you make certain actions during these earned skill points 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.079
 With this you play new races and free money even if you lose you come in 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.919
 so further in the game 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.449
 Shift has unfortunately enough but little choice is a playable car approximately 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.719
 sixty fast and less fast cars have changed and that is in comparison 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.139
 With competitors Guangzhou is nice and Forza a bit of a disappointment 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.179
 the cars that are there are among the best there are 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:11.609
 For example, you may drive a motion laco kve a Merkel and FM a suit 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.719
 arizona in a nissan 53 gt r 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.370
 every car is finished to perfection, the same also applies to the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.779
 present circuits 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.469
 real jobs are interspersed with fantasy circuits but these are not one 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:27.349
 animal unfinished looks shift is made with great attention to detail 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:31.039
 The game also has something to offer online 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.340
 you can choose between the standard quick race or the interesting duo mode 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.710
 in duo it is intended that you crawl up and always difficult problem 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.340
 roughly equivalent to the opponent 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.910
 then the one drove one by one and it is up to you to show that you 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.910
 are the best 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.039
 has expanded the online mode is not and in combination with a reasonable 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.039
 fast unlockable career mode 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 is he has no game that you will play next year 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.339
 that is not before speed shift the side of the simulation went up with it 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.849
 putting on slightly mad studios is no longer a surprise 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.849
 that the children would be good is that thanks to the cockpit view it is 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.530
 sense of speed in the eye for detail has to bind 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.980
 inter speed series was brought back to the top maybe it's a knee 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.060
 has become another top than we were used to but it is certainly a good racing game 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.260
 therefore am very surprising 8 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
 for not for speed shift 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:32.149
