upgraded from the NES honestly after

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.610 
upgraded from the NES honestly after

seeing games like Final Fantasy 3 and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860 
seeing games like Final Fantasy 3 and
Chrono<00:02:28.980> Trigger<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.670> think<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> SNES

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
Chrono Trigger you think that the SNES

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.040 
Chrono Trigger you think that the SNES
would<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.470> capable<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.190> better<00:02:32.430> than<00:02:32.520> this<00:02:33.050> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
would be capable of better than this the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.070 
would be capable of better than this the
sound<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.709> music<00:02:34.890> are<00:02:35.400> improved<00:02:35.880> much<00:02:36.660> more

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
sound and music are improved much more

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.150 
sound and music are improved much more
substantially<00:02:37.950> though<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.090> battle<00:02:39.540> fanfare

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.460 

hasn't<00:02:44.160> gotten<00:02:44.340> any<00:02:44.520> less<00:02:44.790> irritating<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
hasn't gotten any less irritating the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.510 
hasn't gotten any less irritating the
dungeons<00:02:46.950> are<00:02:47.130> bigger

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
dungeons are bigger

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.340 
dungeons are bigger
I<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:48.150> they<00:02:48.239> doubled<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> size<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.230> them

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
I think they doubled the size of them

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.740 
I think they doubled the size of them
and<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.130> torches<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.850> light<00:02:51.030> spells<00:02:51.390> seemed

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
and the torches and light spells seemed

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.740 
and the torches and light spells seemed
to<00:02:51.900> last<00:02:52.110> longer<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.120> finally<00:02:54.390> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
to last longer and you can finally just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.410 
to last longer and you can finally just
walk<00:02:55.200> onto<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.010> stairs<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.640> walk<00:02:56.850> down<00:02:57.150> them

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
walk onto the stairs to walk down them

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.320 
walk onto the stairs to walk down them
instead<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.380> having<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.860> pick<00:02:59.130> stairs<00:02:59.700> from<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
instead of having to pick stairs from a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.860 
instead of having to pick stairs from a
menu<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> concept<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:03.330> biggest

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
menu what a concept the biggest

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.320 
menu what a concept the biggest
improvement<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.709> think<00:03:04.790> comes<00:03:05.790> from<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
improvement I think comes from the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.720 
improvement I think comes from the
reduced<00:03:06.900> grinding<00:03:07.560> don't<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.519> me<00:03:08.700> wrong

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
reduced grinding don't get me wrong

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.940 
reduced grinding don't get me wrong
there's<00:03:09.480> still<00:03:09.810> plenty<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.380> grinding

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there's still plenty of grinding

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.940 
there's still plenty of grinding
