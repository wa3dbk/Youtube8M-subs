00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.290
 and dance 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.340
 my name is arnold swords and my trade 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.340
 he is a carpenter 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.300
 in which he is sitting because he looks is a 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.840
 chair of this model that is a jordan 8 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.840
 aqua 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.629
 What do I tell you? I dedicate myself to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.690
 carpentry and this came from my taste 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.519
 for tennis and the desire to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 combine what has always surrounded me 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.620
 and my taste for tennis I always 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.750
 I was with the wood and the glass I think 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.780
 that is the result I liked and the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.250
 combination is this piece is a jordan 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.680
 3 cedar is all cedar template 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.790
 since the year it comes with its box 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.370
 this is a jordan 8 water this is 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.290
 this chair detached that 30 of the 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.340
 reasons he brings and a basketball 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.710
 the pins of 23 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 that more than more to the sole is in everything 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.920
 the back side 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.920
 basically that's what I have right now 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.600
 everything is mahogany all the material itself is 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.670
 a block of wood that I'm cutting 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.250
 and giving it shape while while I'm going 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.770
 observing in a piece from scale 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.680
 real I'm taking the measurements and passing it 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 the wood with vinyl are lacquers 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.230
 rains that I use to give all the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.510
 form is as far as possible I try to 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.970
 reproduce as faithful as possible to the 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.970
 wood often does not allow you to do 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.310
 very fine details because the goal is 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.600
 found or the material is very hard or 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 you just do not have the ability to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.120
 give that detail but I try to do the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.530
 detail as bad as possible 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.460
 more aspect of the appearance rather 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 putting the seams 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.930
 just so it's like it's one for 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.180
 I'm doing the eye to the listener what 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.030
 that I give the whole turn and I reaffirm 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.360
 all sewing 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.000
 returning it was traveled in this average 20 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.800
 3 months in this 6 because they are more pieces 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.600
 independent because in fact this 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.850
 comes loose 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.550
 in this it takes me like a month or something more 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.000
 practical the most colorful wave behind 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.860
 of the tapestry is to get the jacket that 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.630
 it was because it was for a fat man it has been a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.010
 huge this take the tapestry the shape and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.060
 that will help me the time because many 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.000
 Sometimes they do not take things out with the cold 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.680
 and I took it as a whole very easy 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.680
 like a little less than a year 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.600
 the wave is that I can not dedicate myself 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.930
 full because there is no such sponsorship 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.090
 that I can see how and what I 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.830
 like I have devised there are models that do not 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.069
 I like that the hatreds of jordan 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.400
 example 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.069
 in a 22 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.230
 I do not like at all the ones that I like 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.239
 are the first 11 are those that I 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.090
 I intend that this will definitely go to 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.870
 do if someone comes out that you like a lot 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.410
 and tell me do this to me on the 20th of the 20th and such 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.320
 well, I think about it and I do 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.000
 by request it is not for taste this is taste 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.700
 and of my taste they are going to be the first 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.100
 eleven and the self is one that I like 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.320
 a lot and from there to better venture 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.090
 in doing other things what a 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.700
 zone is to approach the brand and try to 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.890
 look for you as sponsorship or something else 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.220
 serious to be able to devote myself in depth in 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.220
 this 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.640
 one of thanks
