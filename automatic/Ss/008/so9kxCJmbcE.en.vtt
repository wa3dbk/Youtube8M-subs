00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
shoulders is working on thoracic spine

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.500 
shoulders is working on thoracic spine
mobility<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.600> lot<00:00:35.379> of<00:00:35.500> us<00:00:35.649> bad<00:00:36.399> faulty<00:00:36.789> posture

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
mobility a lot of us bad faulty posture

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.419 
mobility a lot of us bad faulty posture
areas<00:00:37.780> laugh<00:00:38.019> a<00:00:38.230> movement<00:00:38.829> are<00:00:39.159> going<00:00:39.370> to

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
areas laugh a movement are going to

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.220 
areas laugh a movement are going to
start<00:00:39.640> getting<00:00:39.760> stuck<00:00:40.269> and<00:00:40.870> getting<00:00:41.109> this

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
start getting stuck and getting this

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.079 
start getting stuck and getting this
hunched-over<00:00:42.159> posture

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
hunched-over posture

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.479 
hunched-over posture
so<00:00:43.659> this<00:00:43.809> thoracic<00:00:44.409> spine<00:00:44.710> from<00:00:45.159> about<00:00:45.339> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
so this thoracic spine from about the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.259 
so this thoracic spine from about the
base<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.940> your<00:00:45.969> neck<00:00:46.329> down<00:00:46.960> here<00:00:47.379> is<00:00:47.499> about<00:00:47.679> t12

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
base of your neck down here is about t12

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.040 
base of your neck down here is about t12
that's<00:00:49.269> going<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.510> start<00:00:49.719> really<00:00:49.929> getting

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
that's going to start really getting

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.889 
that's going to start really getting
stuck<00:00:50.589> in<00:00:50.800> an<00:00:50.890> offset<00:00:51.280> posture<00:00:51.909> you're<00:00:52.690> going

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
stuck in an offset posture you're going

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.899 
stuck in an offset posture you're going
to<00:00:52.960> lose<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.679> ability<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:54.190> extend<00:00:54.579> your<00:00:54.760> spine

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
to lose the ability to extend your spine

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.309 
to lose the ability to extend your spine
and<00:00:55.479> you're<00:00:55.809> going<00:00:55.929> to<00:00:55.989> start<00:00:56.170> losing

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
and you're going to start losing

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.040 
and you're going to start losing
rotation<00:00:57.089> so<00:00:58.089> why<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.389> important<00:00:58.960> why

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
rotation so why is that important why

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.569 
rotation so why is that important why
does<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.199> help<00:00:59.409> your<00:00:59.499> shoulders<00:00:59.739> your

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
does that help your shoulders your

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.149 
does that help your shoulders your
scapula<00:01:01.030> sit<00:01:01.600> on<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.780> rib<00:01:01.960> cage<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.039> when

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
scapula sit on the rib cage and so when

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.130 
scapula sit on the rib cage and so when
your<00:01:03.280> thoracic<00:01:03.609> spine<00:01:03.850> starts<00:01:04.540> getting<00:01:04.750> stuck

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
your thoracic spine starts getting stuck

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.620 
your thoracic spine starts getting stuck
it<00:01:05.740> starts<00:01:06.159> changing<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:07.030> offsetting<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
it starts changing and offsetting the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.570 
it starts changing and offsetting the
motions<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> shape<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.920> your<00:01:09.070> rib<00:01:09.280> cage

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
motions and the shape of your rib cage

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.990 
motions and the shape of your rib cage
so<00:01:09.970> your<00:01:10.720> scapula<00:01:11.290> which<00:01:11.770> comprises<00:01:12.250> part<00:01:12.850> of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
so your scapula which comprises part of

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.310 
so your scapula which comprises part of
your<00:01:13.090> shoulder<00:01:13.450> joint<00:01:13.690> along<00:01:14.050> with<00:01:14.230> the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
your shoulder joint along with the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.740 
your shoulder joint along with the
humerus<00:01:14.740> isn't<00:01:15.730> going<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.910> move<00:01:16.060> properly<00:01:16.390> and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
humerus isn't going to move properly and

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.260 
humerus isn't going to move properly and
its<00:01:17.080> posture<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.710> going<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.920> be<00:01:18.040> offset<00:01:18.270> so

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
its posture is going to be offset so

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.580 
its posture is going to be offset so

way<00:03:57.340> up<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.549> spine<00:03:57.870> find<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.930> segment<00:03:59.379> is

00:03:59.459 --> 00:03:59.469 
way up the spine find a segment is

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.470 
way up the spine find a segment is
particularly<00:03:59.950> tight<00:04:00.430> do<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.090> few<00:04:01.329> extra

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
particularly tight do a few extra

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.740 
particularly tight do a few extra
breaths<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.819> after<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.120> work<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:04.389> that<00:04:04.510> for<00:04:04.689> a

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
breaths so after you work on that for a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.539 
breaths so after you work on that for a
bit<00:04:04.780> tennis<00:04:05.469> balls<00:04:05.739> this<00:04:06.040> will<00:04:06.219> really<00:04:06.459> get

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
bit tennis balls this will really get

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.709 
bit tennis balls this will really get
stuff<00:04:06.849> going<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.239> mind

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:07.719 
stuff going in this mind

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.800 
stuff going in this mind
you're<00:04:08.319> basically<00:04:08.650> put<00:04:08.889> your<00:04:09.010> spine<00:04:09.340> on<00:04:09.810> that

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you're basically put your spine on that

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.569 
you're basically put your spine on that
indentation<00:04:11.169> in<00:04:11.650> between<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.069> two<00:04:12.250> tennis

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
indentation in between the two tennis

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:24.749 
indentation in between the two tennis
balls<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.630> inhale<00:04:17.009> exhale<00:04:22.680> that's<00:04:23.680> seven<00:04:24.280> and

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
balls and inhale exhale that's seven and

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.460 
balls and inhale exhale that's seven and
then<00:04:24.880> again<00:04:25.060> we<00:04:25.180> go<00:04:25.270> all<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.479> way<00:04:25.599> up<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.349> you'd

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
then again we go all the way up so you'd

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.379 
then again we go all the way up so you'd
end<00:04:26.620> up<00:04:26.710> doing<00:04:27.039> probably<00:04:27.310> about<00:04:27.550> 20-25

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
end up doing probably about 20-25

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.689 
end up doing probably about 20-25
movements<00:04:29.139> all<00:04:29.259> the<00:04:29.349> way<00:04:29.470> up<00:04:29.680> let's<00:04:30.370> do<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.520> few

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
movements all the way up let's do a few

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.999 
movements all the way up let's do a few
more<00:04:30.870> I'm<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.990> little<00:04:32.199> tight<00:04:32.380> there<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:32.919> I

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
more I'm a little tight there so I

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.969 
more I'm a little tight there so I
probably<00:04:33.250> do<00:04:33.490> an<00:04:34.419> extra<00:04:34.750> movement<00:04:35.169> or<00:04:35.229> two<00:04:37.979> and

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
probably do an extra movement or two and

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.990 
probably do an extra movement or two and
that<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.320> accomplishing<00:04:41.550> some<00:04:42.550> spinal

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
that is accomplishing some spinal

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.170 
that is accomplishing some spinal
immobilization<00:04:43.240> for<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.259> thoracic<00:04:44.650> extension

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
immobilization for a thoracic extension

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.300 
immobilization for a thoracic extension
like<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.240> said<00:04:46.539> it's<00:04:47.259> an<00:04:47.349> important<00:04:47.860> piece<00:04:48.070> to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
like I said it's an important piece to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.240 
like I said it's an important piece to
get<00:04:48.460> those<00:04:48.669> shoulders<00:04:49.080> moving<00:04:50.080> optimally<00:04:50.919> on

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
get those shoulders moving optimally on

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.719 
get those shoulders moving optimally on
the<00:04:51.490> ribcage<00:04:51.789> that<00:04:52.419> often<00:04:52.930> gets<00:04:53.080> overlooked

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
the ribcage that often gets overlooked

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.460 
the ribcage that often gets overlooked
thoracic<00:04:54.729> spine<00:04:55.000> it's<00:04:55.270> important<00:04:55.810> aspect<00:04:56.349> to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
thoracic spine it's important aspect to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.560 
thoracic spine it's important aspect to
the<00:04:56.560> kinetic<00:04:56.889> chain<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:58.000> if<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.240> are<00:04:58.360> having

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
the kinetic chain so if you are having

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.510 
the kinetic chain so if you are having
trouble<00:04:59.169> with<00:04:59.199> your<00:04:59.320> shoulders<00:04:59.889> or<00:05:00.190> want<00:05:00.490> to
