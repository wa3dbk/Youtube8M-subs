time to actually having to wash my hair
it's<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.540> buildup<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
it's got a lot of buildup in it so I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770 
it's got a lot of buildup in it so I
think<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.010> clarifying<00:00:38.430> shampoo<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
think a clarifying shampoo is just so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.299 
think a clarifying shampoo is just so
important<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.410> me<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
important for me and then I go and I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.560 
important for me and then I go and I
wash<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> different<00:00:42.000> shampoo

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wash it with a different shampoo
