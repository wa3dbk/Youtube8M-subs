00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.290
 welcome to a new video of my 3 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.560
 solís blake a tutorial to win 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.880
 money in gta 5 next-gene is worth first 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.740
 what we are going to do is go to the pause menu 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.779
 and once in the pause menu what 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.759
 let's do is go to playlists 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.170
 challenges and once we're inside 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.960
 challenges what we're going to do is look 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 a game in which good now 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 there are a lot of lists above no 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.070
 same but more down there is a lot 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.160
 of lists in which they are giving us 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.870
 half a million I do not understand how it works 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.960
 how it's done I do not know I just know that what 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.550
 do the kids and good the requirement 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.829
 minimum is to have at least a quarter of 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.790
 million is to say 250 thousand to be able 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.559
 take part 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.250
 we find any career I'm going to 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.809
 choose this same mind in which good 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.760
 where we would simply have to 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.219
 meet the goal that is to do the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.219
 race in a time that they ask us 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.780
 all you need is that the only thing 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.690
 bad about this cliché is that you need 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.400
 250,000 to participate, you have to 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.870
 look a little bit in the races the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.490
 CHILD challenge does not have much more 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.340
 mystery but you have to look for life 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.229
 a little 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.750
 well once we have chosen everything 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.950
 we are ready to run and what else 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.069
 only that we would have to do as I have 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.859
 said before is to beat the record that we 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.539
 puts down challenge time is here in 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.240
 this case is two and a half minutes or more 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.369
 less 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.829
 and it's important to win because if not 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.119
 we would lose those 250 thousand is not difficult 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.119
 so you do not want it 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.920
 on the other hand the only other bad side 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 of this law is also that you can not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.840
 do next is to say is a 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.610
 daily challenge but good I think for 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.930
 what we take from gta in new 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.700
 generation I think it's good that there 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.700
 found this and share it 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.640
 good here the race finished as you see 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.490
 the finished first challenge 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.850
 part one of one here my time 2 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.490
 11 more than enough to swim here 2,940 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.990
 ignore this totally you do not have that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.670
 worry 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.190
 because right now here he puts 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.630
 winner you will have to go to the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.080
 continue screen you give to 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.460
 continue and after a few seconds we 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.690
 it will come out as if we had finished 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.340
 a list of challenges or missions and 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.440
 will tell us you have been first in the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.400
 Greek challenge and down to the right and 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.349
 you see it half a million 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.670
 and well nothing now I show you here in the 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.430
 Bank 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.290
 and that's all I think is very simple and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.530
 quite that is going to help quite 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.530
 finally we see in the next greeting
