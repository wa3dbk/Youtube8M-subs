00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
to take and bond to the paper okay once

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.399 
to take and bond to the paper okay once
you've<00:01:22.560> held<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
you've held it then you know that it's

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.240 
you've held it then you know that it's
wanting<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.560> stick<00:01:27.829> roll<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.009> around

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.590 

guiding<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.520> should<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:35.450> putting<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
guiding it up should go putting on a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.010 
guiding it up should go putting on a
little<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> glue<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> end<00:01:42.020> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
little bit of glue on the end and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.270 
little bit of glue on the end and
holding<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> second<00:01:45.920> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.100> can

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
holding it there for a second if you can

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.970 
holding it there for a second if you can
see<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.470 

maybe<00:01:53.980> if<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.220> take<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:54.670> away<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.000> can<00:01:55.240> see

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
maybe if I take that away you can see

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.210 
maybe if I take that away you can see
that<00:01:55.690> better<00:01:57.360> okay<00:02:01.410> now<00:02:02.410> that's<00:02:02.590> going<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.980> be

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
that better okay now that's going to be

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.540

used a good strong craft glue for this
because<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.230> stand<00:03:29.500> upright<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
because it's going to stand upright and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
the base in the middle and you can use

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.270 
the base in the middle and you can use
your<00:03:42.070> tool<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:44.160> push<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.400> down<00:03:47.040> all<00:03:48.040> that

to<00:04:28.580> finish<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.150> leaf<00:04:29.300> off<00:04:29.510> we're<00:04:29.750> just<00:04:29.900> going

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
to finish the leaf off we're just going

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.050 
to finish the leaf off we're just going
to<00:04:30.110> sponge<00:04:30.410> around<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.370> edge<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:33.940> when<00:04:34.940> you

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
to sponge around the edge and when you

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.450 
to sponge around the edge and when you
sponge<00:04:35.419> that's<00:04:35.810> going<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.260> really<00:04:37.100> highlight

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
sponge that's going to really highlight

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.090 
sponge that's going to really highlight
where<00:04:37.880> you've<00:04:38.090> just<00:04:38.120> embossed<00:04:38.890> as<00:04:39.890> well

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
where you've just embossed as well

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
where you've just embossed as well
sponge<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.190> down<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.490> center<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:46.160> that's<00:04:46.910> as

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
sponge it down the center and that's as

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.820 
sponge it down the center and that's as
easy<00:04:47.450> as<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.260> Leafs<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.669> leaves<00:04:49.880> get<00:04:50.830> okay

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
easy as the Leafs to the leaves get okay

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.080 
easy as the Leafs to the leaves get okay
so<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.040> used<00:04:52.400> three<00:04:52.760> leaves<00:04:53.050> in<00:04:54.050> my<00:04:54.290> one<00:04:54.590> and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
so I used three leaves in my one and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.900 
so I used three leaves in my one and
just<00:04:56.090> seemed<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.540> balance<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.050> out<00:04:57.140> nicely<00:04:57.910> now

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
just seemed to balance it out nicely now

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.320 
just seemed to balance it out nicely now
you<00:04:59.000> can<00:04:59.210> also<00:04:59.390> add<00:04:59.840> some<00:05:00.880> some<00:05:01.880> glitter<00:05:02.440> too

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
you can also add some some glitter too

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.960 
you can also add some some glitter too
it's<00:05:05.330> going<00:05:05.540> to<00:05:05.600> come<00:05:05.750> out<00:05:05.780> point<00:05:09.700> which<00:05:10.700> oh

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
it's going to come out point which oh

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.620 
it's going to come out point which oh
here<00:05:11.330> we<00:05:11.419> go

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
here we go

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:21.760 
here we go
some<00:05:12.470> glitter<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:13.010> these<00:05:15.190> very<00:05:16.190> stamens<00:05:20.770> some

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
some glitter to these very stamens some

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:30.830 
some glitter to these very stamens some
to<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.100> top

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.440 

and<00:05:31.840> you<00:05:32.050> could<00:05:32.200> also<00:05:32.350> use<00:05:32.740> some<00:05:33.010> crystal<00:05:33.520> data

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
and you could also use some crystal data

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.980 
and you could also use some crystal data
to<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.900> panels<00:05:35.370> whatever<00:05:36.370> your<00:05:36.550> life<00:05:36.780> nice<00:05:37.780> if

we put some down in here that can help
to<00:05:41.770> cover<00:05:42.010> up<00:05:43.440> some<00:05:44.440> of<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.710> glue<00:05:45.610> that<00:05:45.640> maybe

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
to cover up some of the glue that maybe

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.430 
to cover up some of the glue that maybe
come<00:05:48.120> I'm<00:05:49.120> gonna<00:05:49.300> get<00:05:49.570> squashed<00:05:49.840> out<00:05:50.080> when<00:05:50.350> you

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
little bit to to just offset properly

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.960 
little bit to to just offset properly
okay<00:06:11.620> so<00:06:11.680> when<00:06:12.040> you<00:06:12.160> attach<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.700> to<00:06:12.760> your

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
okay so when you attach this to your

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.310 
okay so when you attach this to your
card<00:06:13.740> you<00:06:14.740> want<00:06:14.950> to<00:06:15.160> use<00:06:16.030> a<00:06:16.360> good<00:06:16.660> strong<00:06:16.960> glue

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
card you want to use a good strong glue

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.350 
card you want to use a good strong glue
you<00:06:17.860> could<00:06:18.070> use<00:06:18.250> foam<00:06:18.610> tape<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:19.720> could<00:06:19.990> also

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
you could use foam tape you could also

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.390 
you could use foam tape you could also
so<00:06:22.360> that<00:06:22.510> your<00:06:22.690> petals<00:06:23.050> stay<00:06:23.320> up<00:06:23.590> like<00:06:23.860> this<00:06:24.130> I

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
so that your petals stay up like this I

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.870 
so that your petals stay up like this I
used<00:06:25.090> two<00:06:25.810> or<00:06:25.960> three<00:06:26.290> layers<00:06:26.560> of<00:06:26.950> foam<00:06:27.220> tape<00:06:27.580> on

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
used two or three layers of foam tape on

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.640 
used two or three layers of foam tape on
top<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.300> each<00:06:28.450> other<00:06:28.720> under<00:06:29.140> each<00:06:29.230> of<00:06:29.530> the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
top of each other under each of the

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.740 
top of each other under each of the
petals<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.250> that<00:06:30.670> allowed<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.240> petals<00:06:31.600> to

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
petals and that allowed the petals to

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.280 
petals and that allowed the petals to
actually<00:06:32.230> stay<00:06:32.560> sitting<00:06:33.070> up<00:06:34.110> because<00:06:35.110> there
