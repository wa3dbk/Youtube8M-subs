00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.430
 twice a week to brumath a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.779
 team a little special bustle for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.519
 one of the few crops in the world 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.760
 agricultural practice that is practiced throughout 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.769
 year 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome to the elite sheet metal is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 a bovine insemination cooperative 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.650
 present in alsace moselle 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.990
 in the meuse the vosges and in high 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 marne the group has a total of 140 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 people of whom about thirty are 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 employees in Alsace are called to Jean 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 cowherd utp connect people 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.310
 responsible for handling animals in the saddle 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.340
 of harvest so the bull is in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.280
 Harvest room mounted on a live wire in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 train which is often a tour to castrated 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 an ox and there are 2-3 falsely on this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 blow in train ie the bull 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 must be prepared to heat up and when 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.200
 the bull is ready the other sampler 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 well with his artificial vagina and 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 harvest the bull's seed 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.809
 about fifty bulls are 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.180
 maintained all year in boxes 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.520
 on the brumath site 80% of race 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 prim'holstein and the simmental remnant and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.789
 vosgienne it's bad either been in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 contact two females since their 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.930
 birth and it would be too complicated to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.740
 manage the potential reach 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.700
 that would generate fictitious reports 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.680
 between males and females 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.360
 it is therefore for ease that the center 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.400
 chosen to excite the bulls with 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 other castrated males but also for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 health issues all the way to the beginning 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.619
 let's go back to history 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.390
 artificial insemination has allowed 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.060
 to eradicate a number of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 diseases that were transmitted during 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.720
 natural protrusions when a bull is born 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 and several cows in his village 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 had contacts with several 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.759
 animals they passed on 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.570
 different diseases including tuberculosis 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.329
 brucellosis is so on 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.520
 and that was erratic and thanks to 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.399
 artificial insemination --six too 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.079
 why we used oxen boute 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.000
 by train so that they have more 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.920
 contact the bull do not have any more 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.030
 contact with females the oxen 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.860
 brumath train are 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.390
 majority of race Vosges because 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.189
 they are naturally more docile but 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.540
 also more robust what has its 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.920
 importance when we know that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.049
 some bulls can weigh more 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.520
 of a ton before being castrated they 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.409
 were themselves bulls taken 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.689
 besides the Vosgian is the example 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.590
 type of a race truly saved by 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.119
 the practice of insemination 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.489
 artificial 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.640
 the vosgienne who was a race on the way 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.459
 of extinction in the 70s it does not 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.760
 remained more than between 1000 and 1500 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.510
 animals and artificial assimilation has 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.220
 allowed to develop this breed is 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.569
 currently we are at 14.15 from a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.629
 effective fourteen fifteen thousand 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.970
 animals so the simulation also has 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.900
 allowed to keep the best animals 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 of the breed and improve the hardiness 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.090
 milk production the strength of the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.010
 race or the technique of insemination 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.609
 artificial has gone through several stages 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.890
 crucial 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.000
 the last date of the 2000s he 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 this is genomics 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.260
 concretely in the 70's 80 he 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.790
 had to wait to see the offspring 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.129
 of a bull to judge his character 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.019
 improver so on ten bulls 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.909
 of honor only two were considered 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.349
 as an enhancer the other eight 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.010
 were slaughtered and their seeds 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.140
 destroyed 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.940
 today thanks to genomics a 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.230
 simple blood test allows to know if 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.040
 the bull will pass his vouchers 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.030
 character or not by studying his dna 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.459
 currently in all our centers 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.389
 of insemination there are only bulls 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.290
 genomic 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:22.139
 so this has had the effect of limiting 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.799
 considerably the number of animals 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.799
 kept 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.260
 at the laboratory level the seed is 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.510
 checked under the microscope we check the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.580
 concentration seed quality 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.680
 if there are words or living in 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.380
 Esperanto zoid and depending on 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.090
 this seed quality our seed 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.850
 our seed sample and diluted 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.520
 said he was going from the east and the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.170
 egg yolk that help to keep 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.910
 keep our sperm alive 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.450
 all this is done a temperatures 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.000
 35 degrees then the temperature 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.970
 must of our diluted seed must pass 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.040
 from 35 to 4 degrees in an hour and when 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.080
 our seed and at 4 degrees we can the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.150
 flake the setting 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.520
 glitter is done with a machine 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.880
 a sight tale that fills three payet at 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.610
 both all these glitters are 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.040
 identified name of the bull the center 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.020
 is the day of harvest 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.990
 so there is a very precise traceability 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.120
 we arrive at every moment to find 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.420
 the origin the traceability of our at 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.010
 glitter that between our seed and in 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.640
 glitter one can proceed to the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.530
 freezing in liquid nitrogen against 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.880
 our seed and frozen in our 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.370
 base other liquid 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.570
 it is kept indefinitely and speed 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.130
 in his mines in the big quarter 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.290
 north-west nearly 400 thousand beasts 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.480
 annually in general two years amy 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.160
 nation out of 3 works so it is estimated 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.570
 that between 600 miles and 700 thousand 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.570
 glitter is needed over a year 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.210
 my job and inseminator so 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.640
 most of my day is spent 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:20.080
 at insemination I also realize 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:23.170
 ultrasounds when the farmer has 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.220
 detected a heat in the morning we 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.530
 let's arrive in the day on 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.190
 exploitation and depending on 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.780
 mating schedule that was done 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.410
 we take the bull we freeze 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.530
 the straw that spend less than 196 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.620
 degrees at 37 degrees so the temperature 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.729
 physiological bull and work 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.029
 consists of 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:49.539
 by transrectal palpation to catch the cervix 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:52.719
 and we with the probe to drop the 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:56.169
 seed on the other side of the neck in order to 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:58.319
 allow a good fertilization for the 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.319
 cow 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.240
 the cooperative offers a service 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:12.270
 ultrasound and more widely 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.289
 also repro tracking so this is a 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:20.069
 service that allows especially after the 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:22.199
 simulation to check 35 days after if 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.509
 the cow and pregnant or not and who 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.750
 allows the farmer to be responsive if the 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.530
 cow is empty and therefore save time 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.539
 and money 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.250
 some bull seeds have known 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.819
 more successful than others nevertheless at 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.620
 case by case 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.120
 the good bull is the one who compensates and 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.190
 improves the characteristics of the 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.050
 cow insemination therefore plays a role 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.150
 of selection in a line of beasts 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.460
 today all races combined 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.349
 estimated at 75 % animals from 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.630
 artificial insemination in cattle 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.630
 dairy and 30% in beef cattle
