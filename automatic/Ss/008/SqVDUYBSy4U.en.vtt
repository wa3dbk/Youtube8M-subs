00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
tomatoes growing out of it and I cut the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.109 
tomatoes growing out of it and I cut the
two<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.730> them<00:00:17.850> law<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:20.430> loans<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
two of them law and make loans out of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.529 
two of them law and make loans out of
them<00:00:21.529> let<00:00:22.529> me<00:00:22.590> show<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.800> those<00:00:23.010> real<00:00:23.279> quick

there are these and as you can see the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.330 
there are these and as you can see the
roots<00:00:32.329> coming<00:00:32.630> out<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.960> bottom<00:00:33.340> they're

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
roots coming out of the bottom they're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.900 
roots coming out of the bottom they're
fully<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:35.150> know<00:00:35.180> fully<00:00:35.630> rooted<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.910> another

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
fully you know fully rooted and another

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.640 
fully you know fully rooted and another
week<00:00:38.120> or<00:00:38.330> so<00:00:38.360> they'd<00:00:38.629> really<00:00:38.840> be<00:00:38.960> ready<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.559> go

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
week or so they'd really be ready to go

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.940 
week or so they'd really be ready to go
out<00:00:39.770> in<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:39.980> garden<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:41.510> does<00:00:41.720> work<00:00:41.750> so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.440 

alright<00:00:48.610> I'm<00:00:48.700> going<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.880> show<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.060> how<00:00:49.150> to<00:00:49.270> do

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
alright I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.120 
alright I'm going to show you how to do
these<00:00:49.690> because<00:00:50.170> now<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.380> I've<00:00:50.710> cut<00:00:50.920> those

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
these because now that I've cut those

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.430 
these because now that I've cut those
off<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.700> secondary<00:00:52.630> growth<00:00:52.870> has<00:00:53.080> started<00:00:53.410> to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
off the secondary growth has started to

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.190 
off the secondary growth has started to
come<00:00:53.650> up<00:00:53.830> and<00:00:54.430> now<00:00:54.730> these<00:00:55.090> are<00:00:55.360> pretty<00:00:56.020> much

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
come up and now these are pretty much

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.750 
come up and now these are pretty much
long<00:00:56.470> enough<00:00:56.740> where<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.010> can<00:00:57.040> cut<00:00:57.370> them<00:00:57.430> off<00:00:57.610> and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
long enough where I can cut them off and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.470 
long enough where I can cut them off and
make<00:00:57.910> new<00:00:58.120> clones<00:00:58.300> again<00:00:58.900> so<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.610> then<00:01:01.180> once<00:01:01.390> I

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
make new clones again so and then once I

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.700 
make new clones again so and then once I
cut<00:01:01.630> those<00:01:01.810> off<00:01:01.960> its<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.350> leave<00:01:02.470> room

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
cut those off its going to leave room

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.350 
cut those off its going to leave room
below<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.220> for<00:01:03.760> these<00:01:03.880> other<00:01:04.030> ones<00:01:04.270> that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
below that for these other ones that

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.440 
below that for these other ones that
have<00:01:04.570> started<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.140> two<00:01:06.010> then<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:07.000> know<00:01:07.120> become

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
have started to two then you know become

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.200 
have started to two then you know become
big<00:01:08.050> enough<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.380> cut<00:01:08.560> as<00:01:08.740> well<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.250> what<00:01:10.120> you're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
big enough to cut as well so what you're

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.450 
big enough to cut as well so what you're
going<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.390> need<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:13.140> fresh<00:01:14.140> clean<00:01:14.500> razor<00:01:14.830> razor

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
going to need is fresh clean razor razor

going to need is fresh clean razor razor
blade<00:01:16.800> this<00:01:17.800> is<00:01:17.950> what<00:01:18.100> I'm<00:01:18.190> planting<00:01:18.430> these<00:01:18.610> in

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
blade this is what I'm planting these in

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.790 
blade this is what I'm planting these in
these<00:01:19.660> are<00:01:19.810> just<00:01:19.990> little<00:01:20.140> chippie<00:01:20.619> chippie

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
these are just little chippie chippie

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.670 
these are just little chippie chippie
square<00:01:21.430> pots<00:01:21.729> you<00:01:22.660> could<00:01:22.780> also<00:01:22.900> use<00:01:24.930> these<00:01:25.930> if

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
square pots you could also use these if

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.719 
square pots you could also use these if
you're<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.979> use<00:01:27.160> off<00:01:27.369> if<00:01:27.490> you're<00:01:27.580> going

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.700 
you're going to use off if you're going
to<00:01:27.790> do<00:01:27.880> this<00:01:27.940> in<00:01:28.030> aquaponics<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:29.560> how<00:01:29.650> i

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
to do this in aquaponics that's how i

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.170 
to do this in aquaponics that's how i
did<00:01:29.830> my<00:01:30.040> roma<00:01:30.310> tomatoes<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.729> i<00:01:30.910> have<00:01:31.060> an

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
did my roma tomatoes that i have an

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.780 
did my roma tomatoes that i have an
aquaponic<00:01:31.780> system<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.350> they<00:01:33.160> did<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.580> fine

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
aquaponic system and they did just fine

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.160 
aquaponic system and they did just fine
i<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.030> get<00:01:34.360> them<00:01:34.509> in<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.660> little<00:01:34.810> bit<00:01:35.050> of

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
i just get them in a little bit of

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.590 
i just get them in a little bit of
Olivia's<00:01:35.590> cloning<00:01:36.040> solution<00:01:36.490> which<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.240> this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
Olivia's cloning solution which is this

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
Olivia's cloning solution which is this
stuff<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.290> this<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.650> concentrated

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
stuff and this is the concentrated

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.150 
stuff and this is the concentrated
liquid<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:41.170> just<00:01:41.350> dilute<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.890> with

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
liquid and you just dilute this with

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.580 
liquid and you just dilute this with
with<00:01:42.759> water<00:01:43.030> according<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.350> directions

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
with water according to the directions

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.680 
with water according to the directions
and<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.009> works<00:01:45.190> pretty<00:01:45.640> good<00:01:45.790> i<00:01:46.000> have<00:01:46.240> had

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
and it works pretty good i have had

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.139 
and it works pretty good i have had
pretty<00:01:46.930> good<00:01:47.020> success<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.310> cup<00:01:48.610> with<00:01:48.820> the

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
pretty good success then a cup with the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.529 
pretty good success then a cup with the
solution<00:01:50.080> in<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.490> mixture<00:01:51.790> in<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.149> and

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
solution in it the mixture in it and

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.900 
solution in it the mixture in it and
have<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.289> standing<00:01:53.619> by<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.100> whenever<00:01:54.789> you

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
have that standing by so whenever you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.290 
have that standing by so whenever you
take<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.240> whenever<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.600> cut<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:57.300> tomatoes

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
take that whenever you cut the tomatoes

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.999 
take that whenever you cut the tomatoes
you<00:01:58.899> can<00:01:58.929> put<00:01:59.200> them<00:01:59.289> right<00:01:59.410> in<00:01:59.590> there<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.890> they

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
you can put them right in there and they

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.760 
you can put them right in there and they
can<00:02:00.190> start<00:02:00.729> absorbing<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.210> that's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
can start absorbing that that's

pretty much as far as they'll go down
without<00:03:59.580> going<00:03:59.910> through<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.270> bottom<00:04:00.600> you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
without going through the bottom you

around the stem kind of tight but not

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840 
around the stem kind of tight but not
too<00:04:19.840> tight<00:04:20.050> you<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.830> they<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.340> need<00:04:21.610> air

enough where they have good soil contact

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.530 
enough where they have good soil contact
and<00:04:26.800> then<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.580> want<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:28.090> want<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.330> water

mean every two or three times a day
preferably<00:04:43.360> or<00:04:43.510> more<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.350> more<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.680> better

preferably or more the more the better
the<00:04:45.100> faster<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.430> are<00:04:45.580> going<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.790> take<00:04:46.770> but

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
the faster that are going to take but

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.070 
the faster that are going to take but
anyway<00:04:47.980> that's<00:04:48.310> my<00:04:48.430> way<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.750> cloning<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.960> it's

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
anyway that's my way of cloning and it's

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.260 
anyway that's my way of cloning and it's
worked<00:04:50.320> pretty<00:04:50.440> well<00:04:50.740> for<00:04:50.800> me<00:04:51.100> give<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.240> shot

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
worked pretty well for me give it a shot

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.040 
worked pretty well for me give it a shot
and<00:04:52.690> let<00:04:52.900> me<00:04:53.020> know<00:04:53.050> what<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:53.470> think<00:04:53.650> about<00:04:53.770> it
