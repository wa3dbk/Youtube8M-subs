00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.180
 the birds on the farmland of europe have been declining for years 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.540
 however, it is the misunderstood local differences in the decline of these 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.029
 birds 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.659
 ecologists from radboud university and the sun found bird research show 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.599
 that the concentration of the pesticide imidacloprid in the 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.699
 surface water is the most important explanatory factor 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 the scientific journal unpublished results 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.079
 we have looked very thoroughly at other possible factors that may 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.119
 coherent 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.170
 with the local decline of these birds 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.110
 but based on our data or the amount of imidacloprid in it 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.400
 surface water then follow as by far the most important explanation for the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.570
 the differences in trends 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.880
 This study is the first to show the correlation between the decline of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.990
 populations of vertebrate animals 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 and gives the concentration at the club in the surface water 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.490
 the researchers found a clear trend 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.950
 the higher the concentration in that there is incorrect in the water 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.329
 the stronger the decline in the numbers of insect-eating birds 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.899
 the fifteen species of birds studied averaged 3 and 11 percent each year 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.159
 in numbers in areas where the surface water exceeds twenty 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.370
 nanogram if that is not correct 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.950
 this concentration is exceeded in many places in the netherlands 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.290
 we have chosen 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.470
 for common insectivores such as the starlings the barn swallow 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.770
 and in many areas in the netherlands we count deep must birds annually 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.210
 that is sufficient data present from a number of those insectivores every 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 population opportunity ended up in the target than a year earlier 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.160
 imidacloprid is a pesticide against insects from the classes of the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.770
 neonicotine sisters 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 When one of the most used agriculture is in that sense is the world 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.979
 the drug 13,095 admitted to the Dutch market 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.979
 the number of farmlands that keep a strong hold can decline for much longer 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.890
 but the local differences that we now note 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.520
 we do not see in the counts before the introduction of in the church aid law 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.249
 the mechanism of action of the decline has not yet been clarified 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.019
 possible explanations are the lack of food 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.269
 eating poisoned insects or a combination of both 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.919
 for a few species the eating of the treated state can also play a role 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.280
 in the case of external members, all selective real recovery of the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.039
 damage 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.679
 the results suggest that they can affect the entire ecosystem 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.439
 this research shows how important it is to have good data sets 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.549
 soften a scientific nonsense 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.419
 This allows the ecological effects to be discovered that would otherwise be overlooked 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:48.749
 being seen
