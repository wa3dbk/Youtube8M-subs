00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
this is a good conditioning drill to use

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.630 
this is a good conditioning drill to use
at<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.050> beginning<00:00:50.410> middle<00:00:51.160> at<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.370> end<00:00:51.580> of

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
at the beginning middle at the end of

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.550 
at the beginning middle at the end of
practice<00:00:51.880> to<00:00:52.240> work<00:00:52.420> on<00:00:52.630> conditioning<00:00:52.990> and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
practice to work on conditioning and

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.060 
practice to work on conditioning and
edge<00:00:54.040> work<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.570> now<00:00:56.170> you'll<00:00:56.350> see<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.530> variation

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
edge work and now you'll see a variation

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.870 
edge work and now you'll see a variation
of<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.220> drill<00:00:57.430> instead<00:00:57.610> of<00:00:57.700> doing

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
of the drill instead of doing

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.530 
of the drill instead of doing
butterflies<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.750> be<00:00:58.810> doing<00:00:59.080> stomach<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.680> up

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
butterflies and be doing stomach and up

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.700
