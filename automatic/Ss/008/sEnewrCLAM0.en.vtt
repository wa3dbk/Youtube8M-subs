on<00:00:38.690> September<00:00:39.690> 30th<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:41.060> significant<00:00:42.060> event

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
on September 30th a significant event

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.930 
on September 30th a significant event
happened<00:00:42.900> when<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.770> giant<00:00:44.250> sequoias<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
happened when two giant sequoias that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
happened when two giant sequoias that
were<00:00:45.060> growing<00:00:45.450> next<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.870> each<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
were growing next to each other and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.729 
were growing next to each other and
actually<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.430> joined<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> base<00:00:48.739> for

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
actually we're joined at the base for

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually we're joined at the base for
about<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.250> 30<00:00:50.580> feet<00:00:51.000> fell<00:00:51.900> over<00:00:52.350> at

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
about the first 30 feet fell over at

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.299 
about the first 30 feet fell over at
about<00:00:53.520> 1:00<00:00:53.940> 11:00<00:00:54.420> p.m.<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.140> September<00:00:55.590> 30th

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
about 1:00 11:00 p.m. on September 30th

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.680 
about 1:00 11:00 p.m. on September 30th
2011<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.610> at<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.059> roots

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
2011 I if you take a look at the roots

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.960 
2011 I if you take a look at the roots
that<00:01:01.019> were<00:01:01.650> at<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> base<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.489> these

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
that were at the base of this these

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.960 
that were at the base of this these
trees<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.410> tremendous<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.430> what

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
trees it's just tremendous to see what

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.440 
trees it's just tremendous to see what
hole<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.750> were<00:01:06.810> growing<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
hole they were growing in and it's it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
hole they were growing in and it's it's
growing<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.710> between<00:01:11.130> two<00:01:11.520> creeks<00:01:11.970> drainages

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
growing in between two creeks drainages

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
growing in between two creeks drainages
so<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.280> perhaps<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.119> just

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
so they think that perhaps it was just

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.960 
so they think that perhaps it was just
the<00:01:15.600> wet<00:01:15.810> winter<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.680> had<00:01:16.729> along<00:01:17.729> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the wet winter that we had along with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
the wet winter that we had along with
the<00:01:18.119> drainages<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.899> each<00:01:19.140> side<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> base

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the drainages on each side of the base

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.580 
the drainages on each side of the base
of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.250> tree<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.060> perhaps<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.840> soil<00:01:22.110> didn't

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
of the tree the perhaps the soil didn't

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.980 
of the tree the perhaps the soil didn't
dry<00:01:22.770> out<00:01:22.920> enough<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.670> perhaps<00:01:24.030> Mother<00:01:24.539> Nature

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
dry out enough and perhaps Mother Nature

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
dry out enough and perhaps Mother Nature
just<00:01:25.289> caused<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.920> trees<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.520> come<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:26.970> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
just caused the trees to come over just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.960 
just caused the trees to come over just
based<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:28.110> weight<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> towards<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
based on the weight of it towards the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.590 
based on the weight of it towards the
top<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:31.979> today<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.970> bring<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
top and so we're here today to bring the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.469 
top and so we're here today to bring the
public<00:01:34.080> out<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.800> show<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:36.180> has

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
public out and show them what has

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.840 
public out and show them what has
occurred<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.070> discuss<00:01:38.610> what

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
occurred here and discuss what

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.700 
occurred here and discuss what
possibilities<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:41.190> of<00:01:41.689> to

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
possibilities we might think of to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.060 
possibilities we might think of to
reopen<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.310> trail<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.030> its<00:01:45.360> accessibility

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
reopen this trail and its accessibility

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.890 
reopen this trail and its accessibility
because<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.340> has<00:01:47.549> happened<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.869> can

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
because what has happened is as you can

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.550 
because what has happened is as you can
see<00:01:49.229> behind<00:01:49.409> me<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.549> tree<00:01:51.420> fell<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.110> top<00:01:52.500> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
see behind me this tree fell on top of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.730 
see behind me this tree fell on top of
the<00:01:52.920> trail<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.790> only<00:01:54.710> perpendicular<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the trail and not only perpendicular to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.999 
the trail and not only perpendicular to
it<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.150> look<00:01:57.330> off<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.380> side<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
it but if you look off to this side it

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
it but if you look off to this side it
fell<00:01:59.400> along<00:01:59.850> about<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> hundred<00:02:00.659> foot<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
fell along about a hundred foot of the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.550 
fell along about a hundred foot of the
length<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> trail<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.290> only

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
length of the trail and it's not only

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.910 
length of the trail and it's not only
just<00:02:04.970> this<00:02:05.970> one<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.479> section<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.049> but

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
just this one little section here but

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.729 
just this one little section here but
also<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.670> hundred<00:02:09.360> feet<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.869> sitting<00:02:10.440> two

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
also a hundred feet of sitting two

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.250 
also a hundred feet of sitting two
parallel<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.549> top<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> trail<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:13.079> we've

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
parallel on top of the trail that we've

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.930 
parallel on top of the trail that we've
got<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.590> figure<00:02:13.739> out<00:02:14.010> how<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.640> we're<00:02:14.820> going

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
got to figure out how what we're going

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.000 
got to figure out how what we're going
to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.450> order<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.870> reopen<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.440> trail<00:02:16.709> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
to do in order to reopen the trail and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.090 
to do in order to reopen the trail and
make<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.850> accessible<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.930> folks<00:02:19.260> this

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
make it accessible for all folks this

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.699 
make it accessible for all folks this
tree<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.489> about<00:02:20.579> 17<00:02:21.360> foot<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.810> diameter<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
tree is about 17 foot in diameter and

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.110 
tree is about 17 foot in diameter and
about<00:02:22.980> 300<00:02:23.489> feet<00:02:23.670> tall

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
about 300 feet tall

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.270 
about 300 feet tall
they<00:02:24.630> say<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.049> tree<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.530> giant<00:02:25.860> sequoia<00:02:25.950> is

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
they say the tree the giant sequoia is

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.759 
they say the tree the giant sequoia is
in<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.610> Grove<00:02:26.850> over<00:02:27.060> about<00:02:27.239> 1,500<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.170> 2,000

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
in this Grove over about 1,500 to 2,000

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.830 
in this Grove over about 1,500 to 2,000
years<00:02:28.829> old<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.579> we're<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.000> taking<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.810> guess

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
years old so we're just taking a guess

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.960 
years old so we're just taking a guess
that<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.590> perhaps<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.370> these<00:02:32.730> two

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
that this one perhaps is or these two

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.699 
that this one perhaps is or these two
trees<00:02:33.299> together<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:34.049> perhaps<00:02:34.530> 1500<00:02:35.400> years<00:02:35.610> old

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
trees together or perhaps 1500 years old

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.080 
trees together or perhaps 1500 years old
personally<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.739> think<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> historical

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
personally I think this is a historical

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
personally I think this is a historical
moment<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.930> us<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.200> don't<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:41.130> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
moment for all of us I don't know of a
