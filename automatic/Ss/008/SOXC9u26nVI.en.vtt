Peggy three
I<00:00:10.940> think<00:00:11.940> there<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> lot<00:00:12.299> of<00:00:12.330> limitations

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
I think there was a lot of limitations

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.509 
I think there was a lot of limitations
in<00:00:13.110> our<00:00:13.200> old<00:00:13.410> collision<00:00:13.830> system<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.339> very

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
in our old collision system it was very

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.160 
in our old collision system it was very
good<00:00:14.789> but<00:00:14.999> it<00:00:15.209> didn't<00:00:15.389> allow<00:00:15.570> us<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> do<00:00:15.929> some

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
good but it didn't allow us to do some

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
good but it didn't allow us to do some
things<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.590> were<00:00:17.070> quite<00:00:17.400> difficult<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
things that were quite difficult so a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
things that were quite difficult so a
lot<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.420> times<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.810> fifa<00:00:19.140> 11<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.769> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620 
lot of times in fifa 11 you get a
situation<00:00:20.460> where<00:00:20.609> maybe<00:00:20.820> two<00:00:21.119> players<00:00:21.390> are

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
situation where maybe two players are

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.830 
situation where maybe two players are
running<00:00:21.960> into<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:22.980> another<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.840> because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
running into one another and because

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
running into one another and because
there's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> contacts<00:00:26.369> between<00:00:26.580> those

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
there's a lot of contacts between those

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820 
there's a lot of contacts between those
two<00:00:27.000> players<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.050> old<00:00:28.170> system<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.679> had

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
two players with the old system we had

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.130 
two players with the old system we had
to<00:00:28.949> pick<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.400> contact<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.869> meant<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to pick one contact which meant that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.840 
to pick one contact which meant that
we'd<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.710> collision<00:00:32.250> animation<00:00:32.700> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
we'd get a a collision animation that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.130 
we'd get a a collision animation that
did<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.030> great<00:00:33.240> job<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.510> showing<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
did a great job of showing you that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
did a great job of showing you that
there<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> collision<00:00:34.740> something<00:00:35.190> happened

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there was a collision something happened

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.069 
there was a collision something happened
but<00:00:35.700> maybe<00:00:35.850> didn't<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.329> into<00:00:36.450> account<00:00:36.719> every

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
but maybe didn't take into account every

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
but maybe didn't take into account every
little<00:00:37.320> detail<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> year's<00:00:38.550> engine

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
little detail with this year's engine

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340 
little detail with this year's engine
what<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.780> those<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:40.110> players

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
what you see is when those two players

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
what you see is when those two players
come<00:00:40.620> together<00:00:40.890> we're<00:00:41.129> resolving<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.879> every

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
come together we're resolving for every

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.779 
come together we're resolving for every
single<00:00:42.300> collision<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.870> happens<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.190> we're

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
single collision that happens and we're

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.420 
single collision that happens and we're
really<00:00:45.360> able<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.870> preserve<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.410> momentum<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
really able to preserve the momentum a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
really able to preserve the momentum a
lot<00:00:47.940> better<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> interactions<00:00:48.989> between

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
lot better in the interactions between

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
lot better in the interactions between
players<00:00:49.699> this<00:00:50.699> looks<00:00:50.940> fantastic<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
players this looks fantastic when you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
players this looks fantastic when you
get<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> replay<00:00:52.710> camera<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.579> see

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
get into the replay camera and you see

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.630 
get into the replay camera and you see
all<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.559> limbs<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> parts<00:00:56.129> bending

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
all of the limbs and the parts bending

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
all of the limbs and the parts bending
and<00:00:56.789> contorting<00:00:57.269> as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.660> expect<00:00:57.780> them

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and contorting as you would expect them

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
and contorting as you would expect them
to<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.920> would<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.250> real-world<00:00:59.609> TV

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to like you would see on real-world TV

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.479 
to like you would see on real-world TV
but<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.690> also<00:01:00.870> translates<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> telecom

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
but it also translates into the telecom

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
but it also translates into the telecom
where<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.690> feel<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> difference<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
where you really feel the difference of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
where you really feel the difference of
the<00:01:04.800> game<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.370> really<00:01:05.640> feel<00:01:05.850> about

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the game and you really feel about

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.749 
the game and you really feel about
preservation<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.750> momentum<00:01:07.369> another<00:01:08.369> benefit

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
preservation of momentum another benefit

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.760 
preservation of momentum another benefit
that<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:10.140> resolve<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.680> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that we get is we resolve a lot about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.340 
that we get is we resolve a lot about
clipping<00:01:11.369> issues<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> game<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.360> year<00:01:12.420> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
clipping issues in the game this year in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.870 
clipping issues in the game this year in
last<00:01:13.890> year<00:01:14.100> system<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.549> didn't<00:01:14.759> actually

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
last year system we didn't actually

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
last year system we didn't actually
account<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.360> arm<00:01:15.600> collisions<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
account for arm collisions at all and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
account for arm collisions at all and
you<00:01:16.860> couldn't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.460> tell<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you couldn't really tell in in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
you couldn't really tell in in the
telecom<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> wanted<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> replay<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.480 
telecom but if you wanted to replay you
would<00:01:20.970> notice<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:22.229> arms<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.070> sometimes

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
would notice that arms could sometimes

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.830 
would notice that arms could sometimes
click<00:01:23.759> through<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> shoulder<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.509> click

well<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.210> year<00:01:27.329> we're<00:01:27.509> resolving<00:01:27.960> every

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
well this year we're resolving every

results are quite astounding one you
don't<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.649> get<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> level<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> clipping

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
don't actually get the level of clipping

don't actually get the level of clipping
that<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.119> last<00:01:36.210> year's<00:01:36.479> game<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
that you got in last year's game but to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710 
that you got in last year's game but to
you<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.290> tons<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.280> variety<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.600> get

you get tons of variety you don't get

shielding<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.590> get<00:01:44.000> more<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> tussle

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
shielding you get more of a tussle

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.819 
shielding you get more of a tussle
between<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.930> players<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.409> fight<00:01:46.619> for

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
between the players and a fight for

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.109 
between the players and a fight for
possession<00:01:47.219> that<00:01:47.310> feels<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.790> realistic

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
possession that feels more realistic

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.550 
possession that feels more realistic
feels<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.750> things<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.530> on

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
feels like things that you might see on

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.280 
feels like things that you might see on
TV<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:51.329> illustrate<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.780> point<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
TV to illustrate the point about the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.660 
TV to illustrate the point about the
variety<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.219> want<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> talk<00:01:53.640> about

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
variety we get I want to talk about

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
variety we get I want to talk about
contextual<00:01:54.329> dribble<00:01:54.750> turn<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.770> is

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
contextual dribble turn and what this is

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.340 
contextual dribble turn and what this is
is<00:01:55.979> using<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> left<00:01:57.060> stick<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.170> beat<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
is using the left stick you could beat a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
is using the left stick you could beat a
player<00:01:58.619> last<00:01:58.890> year<00:01:59.040> by<00:01:59.250> maybe<00:01:59.460> taking<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
player last year by maybe taking just a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350 
player last year by maybe taking just a
45-degree<00:02:00.750> dribble<00:02:01.079> term<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:02.360> sometimes

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
45-degree dribble term but sometimes

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.609 
45-degree dribble term but sometimes
when<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> maybe<00:02:04.200> you'd<00:02:04.350> knock<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
when you do that maybe you'd knock the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.050 
when you do that maybe you'd knock the
ball<00:02:04.770> by<00:02:04.979> him<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.430> player<00:02:05.640> would<00:02:05.850> stick

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
ball by him and that player would stick

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.210 
ball by him and that player would stick
out<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> leg<00:02:06.450> trying<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> tackle<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.680> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
out a leg trying to tackle you or really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.410 
out a leg trying to tackle you or really
be<00:02:08.430> in<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.940> where<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.210> trying<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
be in the way of where you're trying to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
be in the way of where you're trying to
go<00:02:09.479> after<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.960> ball<00:02:10.080> has<00:02:10.259> passed<00:02:10.500> him<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:11.550> when

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
go after the ball has passed him so when

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700 
go after the ball has passed him so when
you<00:02:11.760> add<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.120> year's<00:02:12.390> engine<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.870> top<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
you add this year's engine on top of the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.790 
you add this year's engine on top of the
contextual<00:02:14.280> dribble<00:02:14.610> turns<00:02:14.820> what<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.240> get<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
contextual dribble turns what you get is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.390 
contextual dribble turns what you get is
realistic<00:02:16.800> behaviors

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
realistic behaviors

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.770 
realistic behaviors
realistic<00:02:18.000> things<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> would<00:02:18.569> see<00:02:18.750> on

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
realistic things that you would see on

realistic things that you would see on
television<00:02:19.110> happening<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.950> game<00:02:20.159> like

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
television happening in the game like

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.970 
television happening in the game like
for<00:02:20.939> instance<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.299> player<00:02:21.540> knocking<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.409> ball

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
for instance a player knocking the ball

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.280 
for instance a player knocking the ball
by<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.549> defender<00:02:24.180> he<00:02:24.510> sticks<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.930> leg<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
by a defender he sticks out a leg to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.259 
by a defender he sticks out a leg to
tackle<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.370> dribble<00:02:26.670> tries<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:26.970> jump<00:02:27.209> out

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
tackle and the dribble tries to jump out

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.940 
tackle and the dribble tries to jump out
of<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.450> way<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.599> he<00:02:27.810> gets<00:02:27.989> caught<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.439> he

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
of the way but he gets caught and he

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.190 
of the way but he gets caught and he
goes<00:02:29.099> down<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> way<00:02:30.329> he's<00:02:30.629> trying<00:02:31.049> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
goes down but the way he's trying to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.780 
goes down but the way he's trying to
jump<00:02:31.439> out<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.829> tackle<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> way<00:02:32.579> that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
jump out of the tackle and the way that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.220 
jump out of the tackle and the way that
his<00:02:32.849> legs<00:02:33.120> bend<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:33.780> he's<00:02:33.900> been<00:02:34.049> caught

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
his legs bend because he's been caught

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.349 
his legs bend because he's been caught
it<00:02:34.620> creates<00:02:35.159> another<00:02:35.430> level<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.819> variety<00:02:36.239> that

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
it creates another level of variety that

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.460 
it creates another level of variety that
we<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.659> wouldn't<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:36.959> had<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> game

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
we just wouldn't have had in the game

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.759 
we just wouldn't have had in the game
last<00:02:37.680> year<00:02:38.150> further<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.329> that<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.620> can

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
last year further to that what you can

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.830 
last year further to that what you can
see<00:02:40.920> sup<00:02:41.129> now<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.609> sometimes<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.180> dribbler<00:02:42.480> will

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
see sup now is sometimes a dribbler will

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.990 
see sup now is sometimes a dribbler will
knock<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.829> ball<00:02:43.950> by<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.159> defender<00:02:44.489> using<00:02:44.909> one

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
knock the ball by a defender using one

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.280 
knock the ball by a defender using one
of<00:02:45.030> these<00:02:45.150> dribble<00:02:45.450> turns<00:02:45.629> jump<00:02:45.989> out<00:02:46.109> of<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
of these dribble turns jump out of the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
of these dribble turns jump out of the
way<00:02:46.409> and<00:02:46.680> gets<00:02:46.890> caught<00:02:47.099> but<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:47.700> slightly<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
way and gets caught but just slightly so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.330 
way and gets caught but just slightly so
he<00:02:48.569> takes<00:02:48.689> a<00:02:48.840> small<00:02:48.989> knock<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.650> what<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.159> get

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
he takes a small knock and what you get

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.979 
he takes a small knock and what you get
is<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.549> little<00:02:50.790> bit<00:02:50.909> more<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.180> resilience<00:02:51.810> from

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
is a little bit more of resilience from

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.360 
is a little bit more of resilience from
the<00:02:52.079> player<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> take<00:02:52.650> those<00:02:52.799> small<00:02:53.099> knocks

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the player to take those small knocks

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.520 
the player to take those small knocks
and<00:02:53.549> able<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> continue<00:02:54.569> on<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.959> go<00:02:55.109> after<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
and able to continue on and go after the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.860 
and able to continue on and go after the
ball<00:02:55.709> now<00:02:56.310> players<00:02:56.609> like<00:02:56.849> Messi<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.450> skip

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
ball now players like Messi can skip

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.180 
ball now players like Messi can skip
through<00:02:58.079> those<00:02:58.230> challenge<00:02:58.650> take<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.889> knock

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
through those challenge take a knock

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.890 
through those challenge take a knock
bounce<00:02:59.700> off<00:02:59.940> of<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.180> tackle<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.629> still

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
bounce off of a tackle and still

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.809 
bounce off of a tackle and still
continue<00:03:01.379> on<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.739> really<00:03:02.250> pursue<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.639> ball

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
continue on to really pursue the ball

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.759 
continue on to really pursue the ball
and<00:03:03.030> continue<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.720> flow<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.109> game<00:03:04.139> and<00:03:04.530> it

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
and continue the flow of the game and it

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.869 
and continue the flow of the game and it
makes<00:03:04.950> for<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.159> much<00:03:05.280> more<00:03:05.459> exciting

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
makes for a much more exciting

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.250 
makes for a much more exciting
experience<00:03:06.389> especially<00:03:06.569> with<00:03:06.989> me<00:03:07.079> on<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
