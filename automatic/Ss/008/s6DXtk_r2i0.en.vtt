00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.330
 very good to all kids welcome 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.320
 to a new video and this in the company of 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 people not me kimura 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.169
 nacho for friends and we're good 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.960
 here because about six hours ago or 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.789
 less we upload a video about your channel 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.259
 this map finish the day would advise 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.169
 that you are going to look at it because the map is a 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.000
 last and its great too and I bring this 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.980
 video because we're going to draw a lot 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.519
 a book that this man has written takes 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:46.059
 He currando 22 years there as a Cossack 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:47.699
 capped with terms that then people will 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.999
 itching or since I am black it does not happen 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.920
 problems and the thing is that we're going to 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.629
 draw one of the books that he has 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.980
 fact that was already superchulo also 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.510
 puts in the description so much forgetting the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 map this like the one of a boxing that has 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.360
 fact of the book that is a pass 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.800
 and to participate you have to meet 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.630
 seven requirements the first is that of 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 Spain because shipping outside of Spain 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.690
 it would cost us a lot and we can not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440
 allow we are sorry but it is what 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.050
 what is there 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.300
 The truth is that they did not talk to you 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.890
 but I 'm really sorry about the shipments out 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.810
 of Spain are already a pass in fact in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.910
 Spain 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.580
 they are excessive within what happens 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.140
 the quick system of that part we win 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.300
 but it would be only for a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.030
 little but the truth but good is that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.619
 it can be done more because it is from Spain 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 It is always to reside in Spain 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 I am from abroad living in Spain because today 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.990
 it's luxury and to participate we're going to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.460
 do it as we usually do almost always 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 the cuts here in this channel and then 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.850
 a funny phrase that in this case 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.610
 it would be if you were a metal gear that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.610
 would destroy the phrases great 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.720
 if I had right now again 15 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.470
 years I think it would destroy the institute and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.390
 surely it will be really you tell me 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.740
 that would destroy I say the institute and in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.740
 the class where he gave that language 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.370
 what metal gear would you ask for sexual raid the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.370
 king 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.330
 it's very very typical is like emblematic if 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.160
 in the mentality part and four of the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.160
 couple I think that of the best yes yes 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.810
 it's a kick to participate is this 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.540
 that for that comment to like this 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.770
 video and to his where we see the map and if 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.090
 you want to subscribe your channel because you 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.620
 I like your content for great because I 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.760
 I am of suscribe also not because they are 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.960
 after what it does or better to have 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.940
 subscribers that you like what 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.560
 I write what you see because if not then you have 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.100
 600 thousand subscribers who do not do so much 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:03:03.670
 basically to make gobs 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:05.650
 as as the challenge as many things and 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.210
 also but you have a fallito like 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.740
 still imply it's clear I actually 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.510
 I am one of those people who has all the 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 blue series and yellow dream of complete 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.650
 that big before I formerly 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.330
 yellow and blue true now maría y y 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.240
 the first one was the red red I have 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.620
 in cádiz the red and the whole white 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.790
 interview in a treasure in fact I do not know 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.020
 I already have a whole number but I need a number 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.550
 I would play that is whole and I have a 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.550
 box is typical of shoes 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.910
 and well you have to participate that 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.410
 using that phase if I were like that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.610
 fierce metal gear that this would be and what 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.560
 you have to do good what can you do 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.820
 it's just here or only there but if you 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.290
 you make the two obviously you will have 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.220
 more possibilities like we did with 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.990
 those of pixels 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.640
 The more chance you have then 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.900
 better for you so nothing has 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.280
 gone through your character or you will have to 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.080
 action also have the description their 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.080
 twitter and nothing we will also do the 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.080
 originality 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.790
 the funniest thing for that because then 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.950
 always for my comments on if I 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.290
 was a goal guiding this would be my 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.700
 Tail because you put it what you put and sure 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.120
 that someone will put it in the queue 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.010
 but well that's something so that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.570
 original 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.459
 we'll take the one who's called the most cool ceo 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.870
 and it will take a libraco there is that is already 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.890
 I say that one pass will leave you as I have 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.109
 said the video the description of the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.669
 boxing and you are going to flip it or is it is a 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.380
 book with super probes but I always believe 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.550
 I wait with good noses you know 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.530
