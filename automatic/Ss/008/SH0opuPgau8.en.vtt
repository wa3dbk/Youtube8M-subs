00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
come in and destroy them you might be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.290 
come in and destroy them you might be
able<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> few<00:01:11.310> seeds<00:01:11.610> saved<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.150> them

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
able to get a few seeds saved from them

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.600 
able to get a few seeds saved from them
but<00:01:12.420> that's<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.190> brings<00:01:14.490> up

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but that's about it and this brings up

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.430 
but that's about it and this brings up
another<00:01:14.730> important<00:01:15.690> part<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> tomato

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
another important part of tomato

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.680 
another important part of tomato
planting<00:01:17.100> knowing<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.730> variety<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.300> plant

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
planting knowing the variety you plant

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.140 
planting knowing the variety you plant
in<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> planted<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.550> know<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
in where you planted it so you know that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.440 
in where you planted it so you know that
a<00:01:21.360> rainbow<00:01:21.860> tomato<00:01:22.860> may<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> very<00:01:23.970> variety

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
a rainbow tomato may be a very variety

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170 
a rainbow tomato may be a very variety
of<00:01:24.780> different<00:01:25.230> colors<00:01:25.410> from<00:01:25.770> red<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.460> purple

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of different colors from red to purple

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.620 
of different colors from red to purple
to<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> more<00:01:29.190> likely<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:29.970> orange

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to this one more likely be an orange

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.260 
to this one more likely be an orange
yellow<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.290> -<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> black<00:01:32.070> Krim<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:33.060> going

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
yellow one - a black Krim that's going

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380 
yellow one - a black Krim that's going
to<00:01:33.330> be<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.690> dark<00:01:34.080> color<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:35.390> pigmentation

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to be a very dark color in pigmentation

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
to be a very dark color in pigmentation
so<00:01:37.110> knowing<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.710> will<00:01:37.950> greatly<00:01:38.160> enhance

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so knowing that will greatly enhance

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.700 
so knowing that will greatly enhance
that<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.150> knowledge<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.230> pick<00:01:40.470> them

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that your knowledge of when to pick them

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.860 
that your knowledge of when to pick them
early<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.520> example<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.000> green<00:01:42.270> zebra<00:01:42.660> is<00:01:42.720> not

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
early for example a green zebra is not

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.120
