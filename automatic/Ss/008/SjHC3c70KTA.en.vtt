00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.790
 hello to all today we see how it is 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.200
 reconstructs long with the cretin 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.020
 then I take my roll with the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.330
 idiots the rod with the rod dai 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.850
 circles found in the center I go to 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.790
 stick under the cretin as you see 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:38.379
 in the video I round a little the curtain e 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.650
 I'm going to position it under mine 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:45.129
 nail you see must be practically 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.449
 very well attached to precisely not there 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.480
 must be no space between the 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.769
 long stupid I'm going to close then you see 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.690
 the tabs below which must be 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.030
 perfect nobody has to be one anymore 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 of the other after preparing the nail 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:03.489
 and I go to then to after having filed it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.270
 my primer is brushed well 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.890
 I'm going to put my monophasic gel 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 as you have seen in the other videos where 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 I'm going to do the reconstruction with 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.600
 with the tip and even here I go to hang out 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.689
 the stack let's say the first layer of frost 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.039
 here is enamel so that I go to cover 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.450
 I recommend all my nail well 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.359
 placed the gel the closest 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.340
 possible at the cuticles but I recommend it 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.409
 it must never be above the cuticles 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.049
 because otherwise once catalyzed 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.789
 the already comes off I immediately or otherwise 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.390
 after a while you see it started to see the 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:48.490
 boils under and I'm going to take note 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.429
 then the gel once you go to 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.899
 cover all your nail if not any 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.340
 you have taken enough to go to 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.229
 put it on top of the cretin print 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.380
 another page of gel like I did 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.390
 I placed it above the map and I have 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.590
 connected precisely the part of the curtain 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.380
 with nail gel after doing 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.610
 this and after having given them just a little 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 in shape that at least precisely the line between 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.120
 of the nail bed practically must 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.870
 be linear with the long door that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 grows as you see in the video 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.280
 ok i'm going to create my camber then 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 I take a ball of gel and but after 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.680
 dissect it about to be 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.049
 and you know that maybe for those who did 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.579
 the courses that if you go to draw 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.930
 long and divide it into four parts 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.749
 therefore also taking proper of the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.609
 your nail then starting from the 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:45.010
 part of the cuticles is point 1 and la 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.290
 nail tip number 4 on the part 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.129
 number 2 the ball is placed on the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.109
 stress point 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.109
 once the crowning is done ed 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.540
 overturn my finger crushes some 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:59.260
 sometimes just below I put it to 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.329
 catalyze and pull my hieroge out 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.669
 and catalyze needs 120 seconds 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.010
 I recommend you check first 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:07.930
 forget to catalyze the nail 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.359
 camber is perfect on three sides 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.669
 then left to be in the 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.120
 front part then watch it from 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:19.510
 parks from several parts to have after 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.760
 precisely catalysed after having broken it 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.299
 start from of the form not used 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.829
 in the command 100 to 80 or less files 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.299
 that are not just a little worn e 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.069
 like mine you see in my video 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.519
 from 100 however it is very consumed therefore 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:39.220
 little lima lim and the ones there for as 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.620
 100 80 are used for the film so 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.239
 those from 180 to 200 may be fine 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.909
 both for tourism and for creating 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.669
 the shape of the nail seeds go to 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:51.359
 just use the gel on the canvas file from 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:54.819
 from 100 to 80 what you go to 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.549
 treat over the long or the sides comes 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.810
 away completely then go to 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.259
 ruin the reconstruction you have 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.699
 just made you give the form I 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.889
 I recommend long not to be at the 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:08.019
 panettone therefore the note must be 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:11.729
 perpendicular to the cuticle part 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.169
 to the side of the cuticles where there is the 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:16.019
 must be must be perpendicular 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:19.180
 practically at the bed of the unia 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.859
 then banish with the buffer to file 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.639
 always long and above for the charlies la 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.340
 filing and pass your brush 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.169
 the finished video in the following three photos 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.580
 sometimes my reconstruction that 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.060
 a purple france with flowers and le 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.770
 rhinestone 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.360
 I hope the video was useful if 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.360
 you have questions that even if bye
