00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.550
 the growth 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 the risk of collapse 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 it is a choice 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 unfortunately 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 in the face of excessive 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.660

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.060
 always when the phase

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800
 one of them wore the bridge 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.380
 dried tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella with cream and if medicine 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.330

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.740
 mechanics 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.320
 the cuisine have in common the movement is something that really deters me 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.200
 on here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.530
 is that he and everyone bingos to do the weekend reunited the friends but the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.190
 my profession really is another 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.149
 when the Dutchman commanded the photo because the people 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.989
 There was only one photo left. He sent a photo with numerous plates in one of them. 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:02.060
 had conditioned the silverback today if you liked is one 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060
 I certainly negotiated with the memory tasks 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.739
 the ingredients are here now just put in the sea 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 sure we're going to get our hands on the dough 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.560
 and now we will start alison 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.910
 the first we make a cpi so the batter is a magic base for any 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.419
 type of marble 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
 it's like both 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.789
 for every 100 grams of wheat we put an egg has a pinch of salt 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.689
 it is stated that the person treats without dramas of March 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.480
 so you can have an exact amount as long as you have 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.629
 what to do 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.279
 so we'll put it here 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.019
 two hundred grams of wheat 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.609

 yesterday four people eating well 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.359
 eating well for sure 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.279
 not to attack humans 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.339
 is not the most expensive ingredient that we have on the plate and mozzarella 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.709
 buffalo 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.709
 but 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.739
 we put two pinches of salt 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.109
 We're making the recipes. 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.060
 and with a fork or start 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.399
 the mixture 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.399
 the new conflicts 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.399
 the tv that really is but as a bit consistent 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.119
 of March 26 can define 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:06.689
 actually buying a chopper for sure you can use a wing already 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.689
 promptly tell the message 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.930
 just as we can go back to maceió beyond the body 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.520
 and what you have commented on can be used for any type 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:30.779
 For sure any practice combining the pasta malam sanha I can use this 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:31.520
 pasta 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.620
 it is the basis for any international dish 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.930
 just as we knew that you who acted little 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.020
 hand to hand hair 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.920
 and following the manual or I could use that 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.009
 mechanical study 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.099
 right 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.639
 put the dough on the pedro already has a little training to not stick 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.289
 and now start slowly open to march 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.289
 a little to each side 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.149
 The injury then gives you a mass bag. It's ready, it's going to be possible. 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:31.029

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.300
 inside the pot people have just tarragona 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.210
 we do not put olive oil 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.229
 because it is a room has a special flavor 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.099
 after paying bail 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.330
 rose speaks in pc flavors is what you mean by that 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.580
 is that olive oil sometimes even like the medium-heavy batter 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.449
 so if I cooked it and the room gets tastier but 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.880
 softer softer 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.880
 already killed about 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.690
 when the dough starts to rise it floats even because it is already in the 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.690
 Score 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.680
