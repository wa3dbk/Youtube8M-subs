00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
itself has been holding up extremely

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.399

these<00:01:37.500> knives<00:01:37.799> might<00:01:38.490> come<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
these knives might come out just a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.999 
these knives might come out just a
little<00:01:39.180> bit<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.500> depending<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
little bit like so just depending on the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.819 
little bit like so just depending on the
construction<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.939> I've<00:01:42.119> noticed<00:01:42.829> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
construction that I've noticed and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.080 
construction that I've noticed and
that's<00:01:43.950> bad<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.490> keep<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:44.909> pocket

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's bad if you keep it in your pocket

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.080 
that's bad if you keep it in your pocket
you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.810> hurt<00:01:45.960> yourself<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
you can hurt yourself but this when it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.050 
you can hurt yourself but this when it's
closed<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.720> stays<00:01:49.079> closed<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.159> won't<00:01:50.640> pop<00:01:50.820> open

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
closed it stays closed it won't pop open

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
closed it stays closed it won't pop open
you<00:01:51.780> still<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.950> definitive

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you still have to have the definitive

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.389 
you still have to have the definitive
movement<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.869> flip<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> open<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.649> that's<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
movement to flip it open so that's a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.660 
movement to flip it open so that's a
good<00:01:56.520> thing<00:01:56.750> i<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.219> Kershaw
