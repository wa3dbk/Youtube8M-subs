through now there's two things he can do
right<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:27.810> he<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> either<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> next<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
right now he can either with that next I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890 
right now he can either with that next I
recipe<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.820> he<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> Overlord<00:01:30.659> or

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
recipe and he can get that Overlord or

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.990 
recipe and he can get that Overlord or
when<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> next<00:01:31.890> larva<00:01:32.220> pops<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.850> for

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
when the next larva pops you can go for

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
when the next larva pops you can go for
that<00:01:33.090> extractor<00:01:33.630> trick<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.110> turn<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.380> into

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that extractor trick and turn this into

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.710 
that extractor trick and turn this into
his<00:01:34.710> ERG<00:01:34.890> Ling<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.909> he's<00:01:36.060> gonna<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.509> first

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
his ERG Ling so he's gonna do that first

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.789 
his ERG Ling so he's gonna do that first
circling<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.500> let's<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
circling right there and let's take a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.020 
circling right there and let's take a
look<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.250> does<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.759> next

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
look at what he does with that next

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
look at what he does with that next
batch<00:01:39.270> again<00:01:40.229> he<00:01:40.350> could<00:01:40.470> either<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
batch again he could either go for the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
batch again he could either go for the
additional<00:01:41.159> zergling<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.000> decide<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
additional zergling or just decide to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.700 
additional zergling or just decide to
pour<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:42.810> Soto<00:01:43.140> again<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.590> these

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pour that over Soto again we have these

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
pour that over Soto again we have these
cigs<00:01:43.950> earrings<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.460> two<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.210> making<00:01:45.600> their

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
cigs earrings and two more making their

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
cigs earrings and two more making their
way<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> cross<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.369> he's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
way on a cross now there we go he's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.770 
way on a cross now there we go he's
going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.790> extractor<00:01:48.299> trick<00:01:48.420> still<00:01:48.659> got

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
going to that extractor trick still got

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030 
going to that extractor trick still got
another<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> zerg<00:01:49.380> links<00:01:49.619> come<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:49.950> we

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
another to zerg links come and there we

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.200 
another to zerg links come and there we
go<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.820> he's<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
go and then after that he's going to be

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
go and then after that he's going to be
forced<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.750> Overlord<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.619> let's<00:01:52.799> see

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
forced to that Overlord but let's see

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
forced to that Overlord but let's see
how<00:01:53.070> MC<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.790> doing<00:01:54.210> he's<00:01:54.390> getting<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
how MC is doing he's getting that to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.149 
how MC is doing he's getting that to
Gateway<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.740> wants<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> finish

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
Gateway there because he wants to finish

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
Gateway there because he wants to finish
that<00:01:56.369> wall<00:01:56.610> off<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.570> gateways<00:01:57.930> just

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that wall off that one gateways just

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.450 
that wall off that one gateways just
about<00:01:58.380> finished<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.040> zealots

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
about finished you can see that zealots

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
about finished you can see that zealots
not<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> make<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.149> time<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.930> have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
not going to make it in time we do have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
not going to make it in time we do have
this<00:02:01.200> probe<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.829> scouting<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.790> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
this probe here scouting around so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.340 
this probe here scouting around so
Thurman's<00:02:03.570> making<00:02:03.659> their<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.200> through

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Thurman's making their way on through

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.929 
Thurman's making their way on through
what<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.680> MC<00:02:04.950> doing<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.579> going

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
what is MC doing there we go just going

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.639 
what is MC doing there we go just going
for<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.210> full<00:02:06.390> wall<00:02:06.630> off<00:02:06.810> gonna<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.380> corona

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
for that full wall off gonna be corona

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
for that full wall off gonna be corona
boosting<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.310> gel<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
boosting out that gel and you can see is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
boosting out that gel and you can see is
actually<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> relative<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.229> backside<00:02:10.679> he

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
actually get a relative the backside he

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.110 
actually get a relative the backside he
doesn't<00:02:11.099> want<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> pop<00:02:11.550> out<00:02:11.760> over<00:02:11.970> here

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
doesn't want it to pop out over here

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.680 
doesn't want it to pop out over here
some

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690

else to realize too is that if you if

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.370 
else to realize too is that if you if
there's<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.570> full<00:02:15.870> wall<00:02:16.050> off<00:02:16.230> but

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
there's like a full wall off but

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.510 
there's like a full wall off but
basically<00:02:16.650> observed<00:02:16.980> links<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.280> covering

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
start pounding away here i can we try

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.840 
start pounding away here i can we try
and<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.160> down<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:23.490> quickly<00:02:23.700> as
