but let's get to the nitty-gritty

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
but let's get to the nitty-gritty
because<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> isn't<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.550> time<00:00:44.700> we've

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
because this isn't the first time we've

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
be nice to think things have improved

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.869 
be nice to think things have improved
first<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> foremost<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.430> graphics<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
first and foremost the graphics and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
first and foremost the graphics and
performance<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.600> somewhat<00:00:51.899> improved<00:00:52.289> that

performance are somewhat improved that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.920 
performance are somewhat improved that
is<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> say<00:00:53.129> they're<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.879> clunky<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
is to say they're not as clunky as the
