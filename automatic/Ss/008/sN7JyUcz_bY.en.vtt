very<00:01:06.119> least<00:01:06.299> hopefully<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.350> new<00:01:07.590> guild

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
very least hopefully this new guild

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
very least hopefully this new guild
master<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> biggest<00:01:08.880> change<00:01:09.210> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
one for the guild master role would be

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249 
one for the guild master role would be
Ursa<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.950> think<00:01:38.640> she<00:01:38.880> fits<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:40.049> for

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
her they're kind of scared of her she's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.120 
her they're kind of scared of her she's
wise<00:01:44.340> she<00:01:44.759> knows<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.119> she's<00:01:45.329> doing<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.130> she

just really fits the role I honestly

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
just really fits the role I honestly
think<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:48.990> anybody's<00:01:49.320> gonna<00:01:49.409> take<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
think if anybody's gonna take it it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.380 
think if anybody's gonna take it it
would<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.369> Aaron<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> only<00:01:50.970> reasons

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
would be Aaron so the only reasons

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.850 
would be Aaron so the only reasons
they're<00:01:51.509> not<00:01:51.630> give<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.930> her<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> maybe

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they're not give it to her is that maybe

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
they're not give it to her is that maybe
she's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.549> young<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.659> think

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
she's a little bit young but I think

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.959 
she's a little bit young but I think
Arizona<00:01:55.649> fit<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.130> perfectly<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> whole

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
Arizona fit it perfectly but the whole

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.520 
Arizona fit it perfectly but the whole
thing<00:01:57.119> about<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.600> well<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.930> within<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
thing about that as well as within this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.690 
thing about that as well as within this
chapter<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> biggest<00:01:59.399> things<00:01:59.549> was

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
chapter one of the biggest things was

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.830 
chapter one of the biggest things was
maka<00:02:00.240> rob<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.950> no<00:02:01.950> no<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.210> fairy<00:02:03.540> tale

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
maka rob was like no no more fairy tale

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.359 
maka rob was like no no more fairy tale
don't<00:02:04.020> mention<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.619> no<00:02:04.799> more<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> think

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
don't mention it no more and I think

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.679 
don't mention it no more and I think
that<00:02:05.460> has<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.149> his<00:02:06.240> story<00:02:06.509> I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that has to do a little in his story I

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.389 
that has to do a little in his story I
think<00:02:06.780> woman<00:02:07.049> has<00:02:07.290> story<00:02:07.530> whatever<00:02:07.860> was

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
think woman has story whatever was

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.859 
think woman has story whatever was
activated<00:02:09.090> when<00:02:09.119> he<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.420> down<00:02:09.599> there

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
activated when he was down there

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.860 
activated when he was down there
ultimately<00:02:10.790> he<00:02:11.790> needs<00:02:12.060> fairy<00:02:12.390> tale<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.750> be

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
ultimately he needs fairy tale to be

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
ultimately he needs fairy tale to be
gone<00:02:13.050> because

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
gone because

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.020 
gone because
thing<00:02:13.830> bad<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.250> happen<00:02:14.549> all<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:14.970> I

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
thing bad can happen all them and I

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
thing bad can happen all them and I
think<00:02:15.090> he<00:02:15.390> also<00:02:15.540> foreseen<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.349> was<00:02:16.680> about<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
think he also foreseen what was about to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.649 
think he also foreseen what was about to
go<00:02:17.159> down<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.519> he<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.030> don't<00:02:18.239> want<00:02:18.540> my

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
go down so he was like I don't want my

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.420 
go down so he was like I don't want my
children<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.620> love<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> death<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.280> get

think<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.989> big<00:03:58.139> part<00:03:58.169> of<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.590> as<00:03:58.739> well<00:03:58.949> he<00:03:59.190> was

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
think a big part of it is as well he was

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.920 
think a big part of it is as well he was
so<00:03:59.459> scared<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.940> letting<00:04:00.090> bloom<00:04:00.389> in<00:04:00.510> his<00:04:00.660> story

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
so scared of letting bloom in his story

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.930 
so scared of letting bloom in his story
out<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.560> he<00:04:01.709> was<00:04:01.859> like<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.160> know<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> just

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
out that he was like you know I just

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.250 
out that he was like you know I just
gotta<00:04:03.120> quit<00:04:03.389> already<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:03.810> that's<00:04:03.959> probably

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
gotta quit already so that's probably

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.330 
gotta quit already so that's probably
another<00:04:04.440> reason<00:04:04.530> maybe<00:04:04.919> he's<00:04:05.129> just

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
another reason maybe he's just

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520 
another reason maybe he's just
disappointed<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.480> shame<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:07.079> as<00:04:07.260> well

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
disappointed in the shame of it as well

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.259 
disappointed in the shame of it as well
even<00:04:07.709> though<00:04:07.919> like<00:04:08.129> we've<00:04:08.549> seen<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> past

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
and of course the biggest question who

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.980 
and of course the biggest question who
should<00:04:31.160> be<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.430> next<00:04:31.580> guild<00:04:32.000> master<00:04:32.540> people

are saying Natsu

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160 
are saying Natsu
since<00:04:34.400> sting<00:04:34.670> hands<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.030> title<00:04:35.360> Natsu

doesn't<00:04:36.500> have<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.710> wisdom<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.340> the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
doesn't have the wisdom and the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.100 
doesn't have the wisdom and the
leadership<00:04:38.240> skills<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.630> think<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:38.990> are

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
leadership skills I think that are

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.860 
leadership skills I think that are
needed<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.620> mean<00:04:39.830> he<00:04:39.980> has<00:04:40.160> grown<00:04:40.610> but<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.600> still

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
needed I mean he has grown but I still

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.020 
needed I mean he has grown but I still
don't<00:04:42.020> see<00:04:42.200> like<00:04:42.350> him<00:04:43.160> being<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.550> headmaster

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
don't see like him being the headmaster

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.130 
don't see like him being the headmaster
