light bulb sockets the holders and the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.670 
light bulb sockets the holders and the
seals<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.409> seals<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> major<00:01:20.729> cause<00:01:21.119> of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
seals the the seals are a major cause of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.080 
seals the the seals are a major cause of
moisture<00:01:22.680> leaks<00:01:22.890> inside<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> trunk<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
126 along with the rear window seal so I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
think when I have these out and replace

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.130 
think when I have these out and replace
them<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> better-looking<00:01:30.360> lenses<00:01:30.960> I'm

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.050 
I'll get all these off and then we'll
come<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.320> pull<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> lens<00:02:07.829> out

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
come back out and pull the lens out

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.460 
come back out and pull the lens out
removing<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> lenses<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.379> bit

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
removing the lenses is a little bit

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.700 
removing the lenses is a little bit
tricky<00:02:10.849> because<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.390> studs<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:13.230> angle

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
tricky because the studs are angle

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500 
tricky because the studs are angle
you<00:02:13.830> can't<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.430> yank<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.970> thing<00:02:15.180> straight

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you can't just yank the thing straight

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.070 
you can't just yank the thing straight
out<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.740> sometimes<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.180> seal<00:02:18.840> is

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
out and sometimes the the seal is

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900 
out and sometimes the the seal is
stucked<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.770> someone's<00:02:20.220> used<00:02:20.430> caulking

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
stucked and if someone's used caulking

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.280 
stucked and if someone's used caulking
then<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> real<00:02:21.420> problem<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.080> deal<00:02:22.260> with

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
then you got a real problem to deal with

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.620 
then you got a real problem to deal with
but<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.950> usually<00:02:23.310> start<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> end<00:02:24.210> I'll<00:02:24.420> get

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
but I usually start on this end I'll get

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.420 
but I usually start on this end I'll get
on<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> backside<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.710> kind<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.980> tap<00:02:26.190> on

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
on the backside here and kind of tap on

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.370 
on the backside here and kind of tap on
it<00:02:26.550> until<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.180> break<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> seal<00:02:27.780> loose<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
it until you break the seal loose and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
it until you break the seal loose and
then<00:02:28.830> kind<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.130> move<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.610> out<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:30.060> don't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
then kind of move that out but don't

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.330 
then kind of move that out but don't
pull<00:02:30.450> too<00:02:30.480> hard<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.650> come<00:02:31.920> back<00:02:31.950> into

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
pull too hard on it then come back into

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
pull too hard on it then come back into
this<00:02:32.550> section<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.810> work<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.260> out

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
this section you have to work this out

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.620 
this section you have to work this out
with<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> little<00:02:34.950> finesse<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.330> move

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
with a little finesse kind of like move

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.760 
with a little finesse kind of like move
that<00:02:36.840> out<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.680> then<00:02:38.310> move<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:38.670> out<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.770> then

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
that out and then move this out and then

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.120 
that out and then move this out and then
you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.040> pull<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.280> right<00:02:41.520> off<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.510> body<00:02:43.130> I'm

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
you can pull it right off the body I'm

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.930 
you can pull it right off the body I'm
looking<00:02:44.610> at<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.880> seal<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:47.730> can

looking at this seal here now and I can
see<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.210> little<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.810> little<00:02:49.530> wetness<00:02:50.040> along<00:02:50.370> this

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
see a little a little wetness along this

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.870 
see a little a little wetness along this
bottom<00:02:50.760> edge<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:52.710> course<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.520> can<00:02:53.730> tell

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
bottom edge and of course you can tell

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.930 
bottom edge and of course you can tell
it's<00:02:54.120> indented<00:02:54.750> pretty<00:02:55.080> badly<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.710> it's<00:02:56.700> old

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
it's indented pretty badly so it's old

any kind of glue that dries hard that's
not<00:03:21.990> gonna<00:03:22.110> solve<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> problem<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.830> gonna

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
not gonna solve the problem is gonna

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 
not gonna solve the problem is gonna
make<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.310> taillight<00:03:23.940> very<00:03:24.210> difficult<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.840> get

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
make the taillight very difficult to get

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.440 
make the taillight very difficult to get
off<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.320> future<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.430> now<00:03:26.640> I'll<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.120> go

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
off in the future so now I'll just go

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.780 
off in the future so now I'll just go
ahead<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.930> peel<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.620> off<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:31.700> there's<00:03:32.700> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
ahead and peel this off and there's a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.160 
ahead and peel this off and there's a
little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.210> glue<00:03:33.390> holding<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:33.990> fact

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
little bit of glue holding and in fact

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.200 
little bit of glue holding and in fact
there's<00:03:34.380> kind<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.770> notch<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.640> holds<00:03:35.970> us<00:03:36.060> in

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
there's kind of a notch that holds us in

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
there's kind of a notch that holds us in
place<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:37.470> you're<00:03:37.680> gonna<00:03:37.770> save<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.930> seal

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
place so if you're gonna save the seal

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.070 
place so if you're gonna save the seal
you've<00:03:40.950> got<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.960> be<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:42.990> little

I<00:04:27.270> just<00:04:27.630> replaced<00:04:28.260> them<00:04:28.530> just<00:04:28.800> do<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.520> with<00:04:29.700> new

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
car we're not quite done with this 300s

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.130 
car we're not quite done with this 300s
DL<00:04:40.230> but<00:04:40.440> I'm<00:04:40.560> getting<00:04:40.890> close
