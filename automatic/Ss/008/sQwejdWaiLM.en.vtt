generic<00:00:14.429> area<00:00:14.820> right<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.360> they<00:00:15.420> all<00:00:15.540> lay

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
generic area right here and they all lay

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.880 
generic area right here and they all lay
in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> tunnel<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.289> they<00:00:16.470> hit<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
in the tunnel and they hit all the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.019 
in the tunnel and they hit all the
corners<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.369> are<00:00:17.430> aiming<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
doors and everything and I thought I'd

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.540 
doors and everything and I thought I'd
never<00:00:19.590> taken<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> time<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.400> make<00:00:20.490> some

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
never taken the time to make some

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.099 
never taken the time to make some
throwing<00:00:20.970> knife<00:00:21.090> spots<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.720> land<00:00:21.930> right

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
throwing knife spots so just land right

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.179 
throwing knife spots so just land right
on<00:00:22.140> them<00:00:22.410> without<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.740> having<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.949> get<00:00:23.130> in

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
on them without you having to get in

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.980 
on them without you having to get in
their<00:00:23.340> eyesight<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.510> figured<00:00:24.630> I'd<00:00:24.869> go

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
their eyesight so I just figured I'd go

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.060 
their eyesight so I just figured I'd go
ahead<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.470> hopefully<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.920> guys

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
ahead and do that and hopefully you guys

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
ahead and do that and hopefully you guys
will<00:00:26.279> enjoy<00:00:26.400> these<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.300> able<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> use<00:00:27.599> one

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
will enjoy these and be able to use one

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.910 
will enjoy these and be able to use one
hard<00:00:27.960> hat<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> lot<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.710> feel<00:00:28.890> like

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
hard hat a lot because I feel like

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.169 
hard hat a lot because I feel like
they've<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.160> been<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> ruining<00:00:30.090> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they've just been kind of ruining this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.700 
they've just been kind of ruining this
map<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.260> time<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.529> took

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
map so I think it's about time we took

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
map so I think it's about time we took
it<00:00:31.830> back<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.099> guess<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> start

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it back I guess so we're going to start

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.209 
it back I guess so we're going to start
off<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> first<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.440> three<00:00:34.469> tunnel<00:00:35.010> spots

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
off with the first of three tunnel spots

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.650 
off with the first of three tunnel spots
starting<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> left<00:00:35.969> side<00:00:36.180> people<00:00:36.540> like

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
starting with the left side people like

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.000 
starting with the left side people like
to<00:00:36.750> huddle<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.110> against<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> left<00:00:37.680> side<00:00:37.860> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to huddle up against the left side it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.200 
to huddle up against the left side it
makes<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> lot<00:00:38.399> harder<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.820> them<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
makes it a lot harder for them to get a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.340 
makes it a lot harder for them to get a
shot<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.629> makes<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> lot<00:00:40.020> easier<00:00:40.079> for

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
shot and it makes it a lot easier for

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020 
shot and it makes it a lot easier for
them<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> aim<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.370> rack<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.790> kills

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
them to aim down and just rack up kills

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.340 
them to aim down and just rack up kills
all<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> people<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.780> running<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
all the people that are running down the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.690 
all the people that are running down the
tunnel<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:44.250> you're<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> want<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

tunnel so what you're going to want to
do<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> you're<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> line<00:00:45.539> yourself<00:00:45.660> up

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
do is you're going to line yourself up

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
do is you're going to line yourself up
with<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.350> corner<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.829> back<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.309> towards

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with this corner right back here towards

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.010 
with this corner right back here towards
see<00:00:47.820> flag<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:48.510> much<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.780> very

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
see flag it's pretty much in the very

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
see flag it's pretty much in the very
back<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> spine<00:00:49.620> you're<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> turn

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
back of the spine you're going to turn

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.709 
back of the spine you're going to turn
around<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> you're<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.300> straight

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
around and you're going to look straight

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.610 
around and you're going to look straight
up<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.350> you're<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
up and you know what you're going to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
up and you know what you're going to
want<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.160> line<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.610> crosshair<00:00:54.030> up

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
want to do is line your crosshair up

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
want to do is line your crosshair up
with<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.660> pixel<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> cloud

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
with this one pixel in this cloud

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.990 
with this one pixel in this cloud
formation<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.699> little

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
formation that just has like a little

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.670 
formation that just has like a little
bit<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> loop<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.379> guess<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
bit of a like a loop in I guess you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200 
bit of a like a loop in I guess you
could<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.520> lot<00:00:59.670> harder<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.090> on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
could say it's a lot harder to see on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
could say it's a lot harder to see on
youtube<00:01:00.329> quality<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.170> imagine<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.649> once

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
youtube quality I would imagine but once

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.020 
youtube quality I would imagine but once
you<00:01:01.829> trying<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.370> xbox<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> should

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you trying to do this on xbox it should

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.189 
you trying to do this on xbox it should
be<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> lot<00:01:03.239> easier<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.049> you're

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
be a lot easier to do because you're

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.479 
be a lot easier to do because you're
going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.949> pixel<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.369> I'm

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
going to see this one pixel that I'm

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
going to see this one pixel that I'm
talking<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.570> toss<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.780> right

talking about but you just toss it right
to<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> side<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.860> pixel<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> going

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to the side of that pixel and it's going

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
to the side of that pixel and it's going
to<00:01:08.700> drop<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.060> layin<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.720> guy<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
to drop in layin right on this guy and I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
to drop in layin right on this guy and I
mean<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.350> thing<00:01:10.530> raises<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> lip<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
mean this thing raises the lip of the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.859 
mean this thing raises the lip of the
tunnel<00:01:11.939> side<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> drop<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.720> right

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
tunnel side it's going to drop all right

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.120 
tunnel side it's going to drop all right
down<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.320> guys<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.770> they're<00:01:13.860> prone

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
than where those to connect and you're
just<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> let<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.350> fly<00:01:49.380> and

right on the dot where they connect and
you're<00:02:17.920> going<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.100> let<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.250> fly<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:19.000> it's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
you're going to let that fly and it's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.040 
you're going to let that fly and it's
going<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.300> be<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> nice<00:02:19.570> little<00:02:19.720> bank<00:02:19.990> shot

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.330 
going to be a nice little bank shot
there<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.590> it'll<00:02:20.710> take<00:02:20.860> them<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.130> dead

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
there and it'll take them out dead

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.730 
there and it'll take them out dead
center<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.940> that's<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.660> for<00:02:23.260> our<00:02:23.350> next<00:02:23.380> spot

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
corner where all the barrels are that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.250 
corner where all the barrels are that
you<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.270> climb<00:02:28.420> up<00:02:28.450> onto<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.020> pretty<00:02:29.170> much

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
can climb up in there and then they're

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.840 
can climb up in there and then they're
just<00:02:32.050> like<00:02:32.380> safeguarded<00:02:33.310> from<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.520> back<00:02:33.700> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
why they even put it in the game to be

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.420 
why they even put it in the game to be
honest<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.350> either<00:02:38.740> way<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.100> want<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.370> able

just kind of like put it in between that
and<00:02:55.030> then<00:02:55.210> like<00:02:55.420> there's<00:02:55.690> another<00:02:55.990> brown<00:02:56.350> like

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
and then like there's another brown like

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.620 
and then like there's another brown like
pipe<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.670> guess<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.940> could<00:02:58.090> call<00:02:58.210> it<00:02:58.270> coming

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
pipe I guess you could call it coming

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.550 
pipe I guess you could call it coming
down<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.900> you're<00:02:59.020> going<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.200> want<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> put<00:02:59.470> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
down and you're going to want to put it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.020 
down and you're going to want to put it
in<00:02:59.680> between<00:02:59.800> those<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.490> little<00:03:00.730> bit<00:03:00.850> higher

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
in between those and a little bit higher

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.550 
in between those and a little bit higher
than<00:03:01.060> middle<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:02.050> mean<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.260> got<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.410> little

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
than middle and I mean you got a little

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.900 
than middle and I mean you got a little
wiggle<00:03:02.890> room<00:03:02.920> for<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.310> one<00:03:03.430> because<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:03.700> does

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
wiggle room for this one because it does

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.070 
wiggle room for this one because it does
Bank<00:03:04.150> shop<00:03:04.360> either<00:03:04.570> way<00:03:04.750> you're<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.020> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.510 
Bank shop either way you're going to
want<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> toss<00:03:05.470> out<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.070> was<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.340> fly

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
right over everything and then hopefully

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.150 
right over everything and then hopefully
just<00:03:08.020> kind<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> Clank<00:03:08.530> around<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.860> little<00:03:08.980> bit

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
like the actual Ark of the cloud

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.240 
like the actual Ark of the cloud
formation<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:34.930> time<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.350> whenever<00:03:36.070> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
formation this time and whenever you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.470 
formation this time and whenever you
toss<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.610> you're<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:36.940> going<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> let<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.300> go

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
toss that you're just going to let it go

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.000 
toss that you're just going to let it go
it's<00:03:37.660> going<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.840> fall<00:03:38.020> right<00:03:38.350> next<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.890> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
it's going to fall right next to the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.860 
it's going to fall right next to the
original<00:03:39.820> spot<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.420> know<00:03:40.540> it's<00:03:40.660> gonna<00:03:40.750> be

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
original spot but you know it's gonna be

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.180 
original spot but you know it's gonna be
on<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.020> left<00:03:41.140> side<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:41.620> nothing<00:03:42.160> really

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
on the left side so nothing really

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.680 
on the left side so nothing really
complicated<00:03:42.760> about<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.000> one<00:03:43.300> but<00:03:43.510> either

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690
