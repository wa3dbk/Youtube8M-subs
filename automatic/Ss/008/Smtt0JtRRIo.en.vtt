from<00:00:29.160> last<00:00:29.340> episode<00:00:29.580> i<00:00:29.880> did<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.359> two<00:00:30.750> hundred

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
from last episode i did get two hundred

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.889 
from last episode i did get two hundred
and<00:00:31.140> three<00:00:31.500> mil<00:00:31.800> plus<00:00:32.099> 17<00:00:32.730> mil<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> bank<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and three mil plus 17 mil in the bank so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.280 
and three mil plus 17 mil in the bank so
that<00:00:33.930> comes<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.610> 220<00:00:35.610> mill<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:37.079> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that comes out to 220 mill so this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
that comes out to 220 mill so this
serves<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> comparison<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.879> loot<00:00:39.270> then

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
serves as a comparison to the loot then

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
serves as a comparison to the loot then
i<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:39.750> show<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> few<00:00:40.350> seconds<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:41.340> you

i will show you in a few seconds see you
there<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> loot<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
there all right now for the loot so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
there all right now for the loot so
let's<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.340> straight<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.539> here

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
let's just get straight into it so here

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.319 
let's just get straight into it so here
is<00:00:46.050> how<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.680> bank<00:00:47.219> has<00:00:47.340> changed<00:00:47.730> since<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is how my bank has changed since the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
is how my bank has changed since the
last<00:00:48.360> episode<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.230> i<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.309> changed

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
last episode and i think it changed

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
last episode and i think it changed
pretty<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.090> i<00:00:51.270> don't<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.899> like

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
pretty good i don't know if it was like

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.410 
pretty good i don't know if it was like
a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> money<00:00:52.649> worth<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.000> i<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a lot of money worth but but i think it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
a lot of money worth but but i think it
changed<00:00:54.690> pretty<00:00:54.840> good<00:00:55.140> i<00:00:55.170> got<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.680> decent

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
changed pretty good i got a decent

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.240 
changed pretty good i got a decent
amount<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> cash<00:00:57.480> likes<00:00:58.350> three<00:00:58.829> mil<00:00:59.039> more

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
amount more of cash likes three mil more

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.420 
amount more of cash likes three mil more
I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.460> maybe<00:01:00.149> 2.5<00:01:00.530> around<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.680> enough

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I think maybe 2.5 around there enough

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
I think maybe 2.5 around there enough
jibber-jabber<00:01:02.640> let's<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.480> straight

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
jibber-jabber let's just go straight

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620 
jibber-jabber let's just go straight
into<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> tradition<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.030> always<00:01:06.420> go

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
into it so as a tradition I always go

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
into it so as a tradition I always go
straight<00:01:06.689> into<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> rare<00:01:07.530> drops<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.280> how

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
straight into the rare drops for how

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.800 
straight into the rare drops for how
much<00:01:08.640> money<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:09.000> gotten<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.600> those

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
much money I've gotten just from those

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
much money I've gotten just from those
so<00:01:10.619> let's<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.420> Wow<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.720> bad<00:01:13.100> 21.7<00:01:14.100> mill<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so let's see Wow not bad 21.7 mill I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
so let's see Wow not bad 21.7 mill I
think<00:01:14.610> last<00:01:14.820> episode<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.390> 20.5<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:16.530> something

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
think last episode was 20.5 or something

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
think last episode was 20.5 or something
like<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.850> increased<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.420> by<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.780> 1.2

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
like that so increased it by like 1.2

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
like that so increased it by like 1.2
mil<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.070> bad<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.090> let's<00:01:21.360> see

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
mil that's not that bad so now let's see

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
mil that's not that bad so now let's see
like<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> total<00:01:22.200> loop<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.740> by<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.430> as

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
like the total loop and by the way as

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
like the total loop and by the way as
the<00:01:23.880> recording<00:01:24.420> d<00:01:24.869> bones<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.320> forty<00:01:25.740> six

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the recording d bones are forty six

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
the recording d bones are forty six
hundred<00:01:26.340> each<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.390> crazy<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
hundred each that's just crazy that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
hundred each that's just crazy that
might<00:01:28.439> make<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.860> whole<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.820> value<00:01:30.180> skewed<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
might make the whole like value skewed a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
might make the whole like value skewed a
little<00:01:30.780> bit<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.040> lot<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.280> than

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
little bit so if it's a lot more than

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
little bit so if it's a lot more than
last<00:01:32.970> episode<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.470> because<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.860> got

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
last episode it's not because I got

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
last episode it's not because I got
super<00:01:35.280> lucky<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> prices<00:01:36.570> went

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
super lucky it's because the prices went

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.609 
super lucky it's because the prices went
up<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.740> 230<00:01:38.549> mil<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.420> bad<00:01:39.659> plus<00:01:39.990> 20<00:01:40.470> mil

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
up so 230 mil not that bad plus 20 mil

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490
