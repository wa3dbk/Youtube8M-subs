00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
one shot at a time but generally I'll

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.190

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.000 
left and right sides of the crate you
stay<00:06:14.210> behind<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:15.290> best<00:06:15.440> bet<00:06:15.680> is<00:06:15.860> to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
stay behind the best bet is to

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.070 
stay behind the best bet is to
anticipate<00:06:16.310> his<00:06:16.700> double<00:06:17.030> shot<00:06:17.270> and<00:06:17.510> fire<00:06:17.870> your

anticipate his double shot and fire your

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.660 
anticipate his double shot and fire your
rocket<00:06:18.260> so<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.710> have<00:06:18.830> just<00:06:19.160> enough<00:06:19.430> time<00:06:19.610> to
