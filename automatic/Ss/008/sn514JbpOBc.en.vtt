00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
 Over millennia, valuable knowledge has come down to us 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.140
 this disk 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.619
 is extremely durable 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.469
 Cave paintings have our ancestors 15 thousand years ago 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:13.509
 made 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.999
 with simple means 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.210
 ascend organic colors 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.409
 hard drives 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.369
 bygone cultures have survived to this day 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.189
 and for medium-sized actors actor time 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.060
 no fonts 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.819
 even the ragged paper from the Middle Ages 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
 All this is still in Wiesbaden today 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.620
 the former elite of the right computer is already after twenty years 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.360
 almost silent 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.320
 Atari Hermida Commodore are relics from Schierstein's past 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.250
 they already spill it as stored information 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.110
 With each new computer standard, even more information can be ingested 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.930
 cope with a shorter time 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.080
 ever larger amounts of data are crowding the storage media 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.180
 The data cemeteries are growing with this next digital generation 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.470
 20 years suffice and once vaunted he had almost died out 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.040
 the 1 future-oriented software is no longer available 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.490
 the storage media full of lost information 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.730
 what we have left of our present day knowledge one or two hundred years 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 in Â«Where is entrusted to digital media 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.340
 we do not know how long a CD I would not have in all respects 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.500
 Magnetic tape stops 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.100
 It all looks very short shelf life data 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.280
 it will 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.770
 if the data thieves with it also have the information fleeting 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.130
 Experts demand 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.399
 the digital loss of memory must be stopped soon 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.170
 in the German National Library in Frankfurt, archivists and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.560
 Computer experts feverishly at a solution 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.399
 Here are all German-language publications and publications 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.430
 collected over Germany 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.009
 Recently, the Frankfurt are required by law and the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 secure electronic publications for the future 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.640
 the task is the explosively growing digital heritage of the German 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.550
 as safe to archive as the books he has been for almost a hundred years 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.279
 Miklos be collected 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.279
 an ambitious project 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.379
 The experts can not stop the rapid change in digital technology 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.019
 but they have a promising strategy 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.409
 everything that is fed into the computer brings a specially developed 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.059
 Program to a single digital standard no matter if it is a 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.059
 online newspaper is or a scientific paper 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.289
 instead of always all systems that come on the market to places 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.979
 In the future, you only want to care for this one regular place 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.069
 made 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.769
 a task that seems manageable 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 but the thing has a catch 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.190
 At best, we become what we've been through in McLaren and told each other 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.620
 active in one, on the other hand, have the user available in the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.680
 worst case 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.270
 that means if you stop our project if we have the whole topic 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.709
 do not pursue further 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.479
 then that does not mean and between examples that this data 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.649
 not that this information is no longer tangible simply plain 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:31.439
 are not present and the incorporation will be a completely dark time 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.479
 for a Grande Nation living in 50 years or a hundred years, it remains the 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.319
 question 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.439
 what to leave for future generations and how much we want 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.359
 is worth 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.829
 even with him back to the distant future from the digital age 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.659
 that's exactly the question 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.120
 What should be kept so and especially the eyes 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.670
 let's do this
