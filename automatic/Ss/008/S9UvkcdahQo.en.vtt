the minus one it means that it's not the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
world leaves no up so if you want to
turn<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.049> just

twist it to the plus sign right here and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
twist it to the plus sign right here and
that<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.560> good<00:01:49.890> touch<00:01:50.220> that

don't know if you guys can see that but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.010 
don't know if you guys can see that but

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that is a microphone right there so you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
that is a microphone right there so you
can<00:02:04.229> obviously<00:02:04.320> take<00:02:04.860> phone<00:02:05.130> calls<00:02:05.159> from<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
can obviously take phone calls from this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.200 
can obviously take phone calls from this
as<00:02:05.969> well

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
as well

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.199 
as well
the<00:02:06.960> speaker<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.649> made<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> plastic<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the speaker is made out of plastic and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.140 
the speaker is made out of plastic and
including<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.379> grill<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.760> top<00:02:11.970> as

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
including the grill about the top as

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.280 
including the grill about the top as
well<00:02:12.360> all

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
well all

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
well all
this<00:02:13.439> is<00:02:13.620> made<00:02:13.920> out<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.129> plastic<00:02:14.519> nothing<00:02:15.239> is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this is made out of plastic nothing is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.240 
this is made out of plastic nothing is
made<00:02:15.540> out<00:02:15.719> of<00:02:15.750> metal<00:02:15.989> but<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.590> still<00:02:16.890> feels

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
made out of metal but this still feels

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.220 
made out of metal but this still feels
very<00:02:17.700> very<00:02:17.849> solid<00:02:18.359> in<00:02:18.750> your<00:02:18.930> hands<00:02:21.049> so<00:02:22.049> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
very very solid in your hands so this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.130 
very very solid in your hands so this
has<00:02:22.439> a<00:02:22.469> range<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.189> up<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.609> 30<00:02:24.060> meter<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> can

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
has a range of up to 30 meter so you can

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.319 
has a range of up to 30 meter so you can
basically<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.560> take<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.189> up<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.670> 30<00:02:26.939> meters

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
basically just take it up to 30 meters

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.630 
basically just take it up to 30 meters
away<00:02:27.510> from<00:02:27.629> your<00:02:28.079> mobile<00:02:28.290> device<00:02:28.640> or

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
away from your mobile device or

away from your mobile device or
whichever<00:02:30.000> device<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:30.900> connected

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
whichever device that you have connected

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.280 
whichever device that you have connected
this<00:02:31.650> speaker<00:02:32.549> with<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.510> need<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> charge<00:02:34.049> the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
this speaker with you need to charge the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.110 
this speaker with you need to charge the
speaker<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:34.859> about<00:02:35.099> two<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.489> half<00:02:35.519> hours

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
hours although they actually claim it's

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.530 
hours although they actually claim it's
about<00:02:43.349> five<00:02:43.680> hours<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.760> actually<00:02:45.150> gave<00:02:45.329> me<00:02:45.389> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
about five hours this actually gave me a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.349 
about five hours this actually gave me a
working<00:02:46.230> time<00:02:46.470> off<00:02:46.829> about<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.340> think<00:02:47.639> five<00:02:47.909> and

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
working time off about I think five and

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.860 
working time off about I think five and
a<00:02:48.420> half<00:02:48.450> or<00:02:49.109> five<00:02:49.769> forty<00:02:50.639> kind<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.180> working

a half or five forty kind of working

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.659 
a half or five forty kind of working
hard<00:02:52.019> working<00:02:52.590> time<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.189> is<00:02:53.340> actually

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
hard working time which is actually

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.000 
hard working time which is actually
really<00:02:53.819> good<00:02:53.970> for<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:55.409> amount<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.709> money<00:02:55.950> that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
really good for the amount of money that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.190 
really good for the amount of money that
you're<00:02:56.220> paying<00:02:56.489> for<00:02:56.609> this<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.200> considering

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you're paying for this and considering

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.009 
you're paying for this and considering
the<00:02:58.349> size<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.859> this<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.250> well<00:02:59.629> the<00:03:00.629> speaker

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the size of this as well the speaker

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.349 
the size of this as well the speaker
power<00:03:01.319> output<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.040> actually<00:03:02.250> six<00:03:02.730> watts<00:03:03.030> which

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
power output is actually six watts which

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.280 
power output is actually six watts which
is<00:03:03.569> more<00:03:03.750> than<00:03:03.930> enough

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
is more than enough

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.349 
is more than enough
I<00:03:04.500> think<00:03:05.159> the<00:03:05.310> speakers<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.730> are<00:03:05.939> three

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
I think the speakers that are three

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.750 
I think the speakers that are three
walks<00:03:06.629> are<00:03:06.840> pretty<00:03:07.109> loud<00:03:07.409> enough<00:03:07.769> but<00:03:08.549> this

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
walks are pretty loud enough but this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.699 
walks are pretty loud enough but this
was<00:03:08.879> actually<00:03:09.000> six<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.439> pretty

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
was actually six was and that is pretty

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.159 
was actually six was and that is pretty
good<00:03:10.950> as<00:03:11.129> well<00:03:11.159> is<00:03:11.609> really<00:03:12.120> good<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.989> to

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169

I'm just gonna jump on to the sound test
this<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.989> gonna<00:03:25.139> be<00:03:25.319> full<00:03:25.560> 100%<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.729> do<00:03:26.879> turn

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
this is gonna be full 100% so do turn

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.409 
this is gonna be full 100% so do turn
your<00:03:27.329> volume<00:03:27.449> up<00:03:27.810> at<00:03:28.079> your<00:03:28.260> own<00:03:28.470> risk<00:03:28.769> though

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
your volume up at your own risk though

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.789 
your volume up at your own risk though
didn't<00:03:30.419> orders<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.049> audio<00:03:31.500> or<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
didn't orders that the audio or the

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.770 
didn't orders that the audio or the
sound<00:03:32.459> test<00:03:32.639> will<00:03:32.819> not<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.120> coming<00:03:33.419> the<00:03:33.510> same

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
sound test will not be coming the same

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.930 
sound test will not be coming the same
that<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.109> am<00:03:34.500> recording<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.159> to<00:03:35.609> do<00:03:35.699> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
that I am recording this to do the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.030 
that I am recording this to do the
camera<00:03:36.389> I'm<00:03:36.569> recording<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.139> bill<00:03:37.349> so<00:03:37.590> it

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
camera I'm recording this bill so it

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.189 
camera I'm recording this bill so it
might<00:03:38.190> don't<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.729> same<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.750> actually

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
might don't be the same as this actually

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.670 
might don't be the same as this actually
would<00:03:40.799> be<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.280> real<00:03:41.579> life<00:03:41.879> so<00:03:42.329> yeah<00:03:42.750> let's<00:03:43.530> just

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
would be in real life so yeah let's just

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.250 
would be in real life so yeah let's just
get<00:03:43.829> started<00:03:44.250> right<00:03:44.430> now<00:03:44.750> when<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.780> start<00:03:46.139> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
get started right now when I start the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.229 
get started right now when I start the
sound<00:03:46.440> test<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.979> will<00:03:47.099> actually<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.669> out<00:03:47.879> low

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
sound test it will actually be out low

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.789 
sound test it will actually be out low
and<00:03:48.540> now<00:03:48.780> I'll<00:03:48.930> show<00:03:49.169> you<00:03:49.229> and<00:03:49.769> demonstrate

and now I'll show you and demonstrate
how<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.579> actual<00:03:51.620> twist<00:03:52.620> thing<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.190> this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
how the actual twist thing on this

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.189 
how the actual twist thing on this
speaker<00:03:53.760> actually<00:03:54.269> works<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.049> to

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
speaker actually works all you have to

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.099 
speaker actually works all you have to
do<00:03:55.349> is<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.709> twist<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.519> up<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:57.109> left-hand

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
do is just twist it up the left-hand

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.280 
do is just twist it up the left-hand
side<00:03:58.470> for<00:03:59.180> to<00:04:00.180> actually<00:04:00.599> for<00:04:00.870> lowered<00:04:01.109> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
so guys that was your show sound test of

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.280 
so guys that was your show sound test of
the<00:04:50.370> jam<00:04:50.820> touch'<00:04:51.390> bluetooth<00:04:52.020> wireless

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
the jam touch' bluetooth wireless

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.650 
the jam touch' bluetooth wireless
speaker<00:04:52.640> overall<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:53.820> think<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.300> really

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
speaker overall I think is really

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.720 
speaker overall I think is really
reactive<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.500> really<00:04:55.800> really<00:04:56.040> good<00:04:56.250> speaker

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
reactive and really really good speaker

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.240 
reactive and really really good speaker
it<00:04:57.210> reacts<00:04:57.570> pretty<00:04:58.140> fast<00:04:58.470> connects<00:04:58.920> with<00:04:59.070> your

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
it reacts pretty fast connects with your

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.360 
it reacts pretty fast connects with your
Bluetooth<00:04:59.670> really<00:05:00.090> really<00:05:00.300> fast<00:05:00.980> also<00:05:01.980> the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
Bluetooth really really fast also the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.090 
Bluetooth really really fast also the
touch<00:05:03.030> controls<00:05:03.630> they<00:05:03.990> work<00:05:04.320> really<00:05:04.920> really

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
touch controls they work really really

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.120 
touch controls they work really really
damn<00:05:05.640> good<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.960> overall<00:05:07.290> I<00:05:07.380> actually<00:05:07.680> really

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
damn good so overall I actually really

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
damn good so overall I actually really
like<00:05:08.310> this<00:05:08.520> speaker

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
like this speaker

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.790 
like this speaker
something<00:05:09.960> that<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.110> would<00:05:10.260> actually<00:05:10.380> change

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
something that I would actually change

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.350 
something that I would actually change
about<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.340> is<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.580> think<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:12.060> they<00:05:12.330> should

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
about this is I think that they should

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.210 
about this is I think that they should
actually<00:05:12.900> improve<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.410> build<00:05:13.620> quality<00:05:13.800> of

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
actually improve the build quality of

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.950 
actually improve the build quality of
this<00:05:14.430> even<00:05:15.030> though<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.450> actually<00:05:15.780> pretty

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
this even though this is actually pretty

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.870 
this even though this is actually pretty
solid<00:05:16.290> but<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.800> kind<00:05:17.070> of<00:05:17.190> feels<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.580> little<00:05:17.700> bit

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
solid but it kind of feels a little bit

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.050 
solid but it kind of feels a little bit
cheap<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:19.610> obviously<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:20.790> is<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:20.970> really

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
cheap but obviously this is a really

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.120 
cheap but obviously this is a really
good<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:21.750> high<00:05:21.960> build<00:05:22.260> quality<00:05:22.350> but<00:05:22.920> it's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
good and high build quality but it's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.040 
good and high build quality but it's
just<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.490> plastic<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.390> feels<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.780> little<00:05:24.900> bit

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
just a plastic that feels a little bit

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.780 
just a plastic that feels a little bit
cheap<00:05:25.320> they<00:05:26.190> wanna<00:05:26.370> make<00:05:26.490> sure<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.670> I've
