00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.750 

second<00:00:33.059> step<00:00:33.300> or<00:00:34.199> staff<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.129> edge<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
second step or staff from this edge and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.930 
second step or staff from this edge and
boards<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.989> crease

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:01:00.560 

yes<00:00:45.900> a<00:00:46.380> for<00:00:47.310> payment<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.329> way

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.149 

there<00:01:01.570> would<00:01:01.719> be<00:01:02.500> this<00:01:03.059> four<00:01:04.059> step<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:05.159> will

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
there would be this four step I will

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.460 
there would be this four step I will
start<00:01:06.549> from<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:06.850> edge<00:01:07.090> II<00:01:07.119> have<00:01:07.900> forests

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
start from this edge II have forests

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.180 
start from this edge II have forests
into<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.799> city

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.890 

next<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.430> repeat<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.030> same<00:01:17.060> step<00:01:17.540> for<00:01:17.570> the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
next I repeat the same step for the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:27.990 
next I repeat the same step for the
other<00:01:17.960> side

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.540 

there<00:01:28.570> were<00:01:28.750> four<00:01:29.140> this<00:01:29.470> trangle<00:01:29.980> shipped<00:01:30.310> out

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
there were four this trangle shipped out

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.880 
there were four this trangle shipped out
you<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.480> a<00:01:31.510> crease<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.110> back<00:01:32.350> here<00:01:32.650> so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
you have a crease on the back here so

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.520 
you have a crease on the back here so
use<00:01:33.190> this<00:01:33.400> as<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.670> preference<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:35.290> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
use this as a preference for the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.870 
use this as a preference for the
strangle<00:01:35.980> ship<00:01:36.190> down

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:57.609 

the<00:01:40.390> next<00:01:41.010> hour<00:01:42.010> for<00:01:42.370> pigment<00:01:42.940> half<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.300> way

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.000 

all<00:01:57.979> right<00:01:58.189> or<00:01:59.060> open<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.810> paper

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
all right or open the paper

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.940 
all right or open the paper
you<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> crease<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.260> we<00:02:04.260> use<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you see a crease here we use it as a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
you see a crease here we use it as a
preference<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:06.660> fall<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:08.400> stabilizer<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
preference to fall to stabilizer so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.630 
preference to fall to stabilizer so
start<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:09.900> this<00:02:10.140> edge<00:02:10.350> fall<00:02:11.100> into<00:02:11.430> disgrace

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.670 

and<00:02:18.640> then<00:02:19.330> repeat<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> same<00:02:20.110> step<00:02:20.380> for<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and then repeat the same step for the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then repeat the same step for the
other<00:02:20.770> side

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.040 

next<00:02:27.280> for<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.790> paper<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.330> half<00:02:28.569> again

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
next for the paper in half again

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.340 
next for the paper in half again
and<00:02:30.590> now<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.010> would<00:02:31.160> estimate<00:02:31.640> by<00:02:31.940> average<00:02:32.510> home

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
and now I would estimate by average home

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.260 
and now I would estimate by average home
visit<00:02:33.740> along<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.880> edge

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.290 

my<00:02:40.270> photo<00:02:40.630> will<00:02:41.590> match<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.250> edge<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.580> this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
my photo will match this edge to this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.150 
my photo will match this edge to this
edge

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.530 

they<00:02:50.160> repeat<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.670> same<00:02:50.880> step<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.510> other

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
they repeat the same step for the other

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:04.510 
they repeat the same step for the other
size

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.900 

now<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.550> can<00:03:05.819> open<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.330> paper<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:08.430> here<00:03:08.700> you're
