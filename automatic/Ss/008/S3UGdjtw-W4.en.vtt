called<00:00:26.609> left-hand<00:00:27.599> turn<00:00:28.340> elimination<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
called left-hand turn elimination and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.290

turn<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.930> frequently<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.710> slow

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
turn is you know frequently a slow

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.250 
turn is you know frequently a slow
process<00:00:56.820> because<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> cross

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
process because you have to cross

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
process because you have to cross
ongoing<00:00:59.010> traffic<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.940> England<00:01:00.059> yet

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
ongoing traffic you know in England yet

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
ongoing traffic you know in England yet
I<00:01:00.809> guess<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.170> already<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.559> turn<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.370> would

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I guess it's already in turn that would

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
I guess it's already in turn that would
do<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.680> wastes

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
do that and what that does is it wastes

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
do that and what that does is it wastes
a<00:01:05.339> tremendous<00:01:05.909> amount<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> gasoline<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
a tremendous amount of gasoline think of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
a tremendous amount of gasoline think of
all<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> times<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.400> sitting<00:01:08.820> there

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
all the times that you're sitting there

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.940 
all the times that you're sitting there
waiting<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.750> make<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> left<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.590> maybe<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
waiting to make a left and maybe you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
waiting to make a left and maybe you
have<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.280> wait<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> light<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> change

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
have to wait for the light to change

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
have to wait for the light to change
once<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.470> twice<00:01:13.590> before<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> left

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
once or twice before you can make a left

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.910 
once or twice before you can make a left
so<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.840> most<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.200> us<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.530> sit<00:01:16.710> there

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
so you know most of us just sit there

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160 
so you know most of us just sit there
and<00:01:16.979> suffer<00:01:17.790> through<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:18.990> you're
