00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
hey guys through all four year and I'm

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.010 
hey guys through all four year and I'm
doing<00:00:05.069> another<00:00:05.279> tutorial<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.420> just<00:00:06.690> found<00:00:06.870> this

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
doing another tutorial I just found this

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.360 
doing another tutorial I just found this
out<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.440> wanted<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.799> be<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> first<00:00:08.040> to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
out and I wanted to be the first to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.209 
out and I wanted to be the first to
upload<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.970> YouTube<00:00:09.349> it's<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
upload it to YouTube it's the it's a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.450 
upload it to YouTube it's the it's a
dispenser<00:00:11.820> shooter<00:00:12.599> using<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.620> don't<00:00:13.920> know<00:00:13.980> now

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
dispenser shooter using I don't know now

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.519 
dispenser shooter using I don't know now
wait<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.059> don't<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.719> if<00:00:15.809> I'm<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> first<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.350> do

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
wait I don't know if I'm the first to do

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.070 
wait I don't know if I'm the first to do
this<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.180> haven't<00:00:18.720> seen<00:00:18.869> when<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
this but I think I haven't seen when I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.730 
this but I think I haven't seen when I
looked<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.160> haven't<00:00:20.310> seen<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
looked it up but I haven't seen one and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.769 
looked it up but I haven't seen one and
they<00:00:22.740> might<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.130> now<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.210> so

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
they might be up now but here it is so

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
they might be up now but here it is so
what<00:00:25.560> I've<00:00:25.650> done<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:26.310> used<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> five

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
what I've done is I've used the five

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.689 
what I've done is I've used the five
circuit<00:00:27.420> I'll<00:00:27.570> build<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> over<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.769> again<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
circuit I'll build it over here again so

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.980 
circuit I'll build it over here again so
what<00:00:29.970> you're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> need<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.810> you're

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
what you're going to need is you're

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.790 
what you're going to need is you're
going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> need<00:00:31.579> five<00:00:32.579> blocks<00:00:33.559> just<00:00:34.559> make<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
going to need five blocks just make a

going to need five blocks just make a
simple<00:00:35.040> five<00:00:35.399> circuit<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> don't<00:00:36.149> know

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
simple five circuit if you don't know

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.860 
simple five circuit if you don't know
how<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> go<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.790> page<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:39.600> even<00:00:39.719> know

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
how to go to my page I don't even know

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
how to go to my page I don't even know
how<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:40.879> I'm<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:41.940> sort<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:43.520> yeah

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
how to right now I'm just sort of yeah

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.830 
how to right now I'm just sort of yeah
right<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.750> they're<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.660> you're

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
right there and they're so then you're

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.950 
right there and they're so then you're
going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> need<00:00:49.170> redstone<00:00:49.739> you're<00:00:50.870> gonna<00:00:51.870> need

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
going to need redstone you're gonna need

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
going to need redstone you're gonna need
a<00:00:52.079> dispenser<00:00:52.379> oh<00:00:54.320> yeah<00:00:55.320> sorry<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> little

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
a dispenser oh yeah sorry I'm a little

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
a dispenser oh yeah sorry I'm a little
new<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.390> redstone<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.250> I'm<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.430> very

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
new to this redstone thing I'm not very

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:12.469 
new to this redstone thing I'm not very
good<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:11.729> add<00:01:12.210> your

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
good at it this and there then add your

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
good at it this and there then add your
redstone<00:01:12.930> dust<00:01:14.420> or<00:01:15.420> whatever<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:17.640> your

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
redstone dust or whatever on to your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.660 
redstone dust or whatever on to your
circuit<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> guys

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
circuit just like this up so you guys

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.899 
circuit just like this up so you guys
can<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:23.479> there<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:26.189> add<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
can see there you add these to the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.819 
can see there you add these to the
circuits<00:01:29.329> voila<00:01:30.409> voila<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:33.270> should<00:01:33.600> why<00:01:34.590> isn't

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
circuits voila voila it should why isn't

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.819 
circuits voila voila it should why isn't
it<00:01:34.860> working<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> circuit<00:01:35.909> anymore<00:01:42.590> okay<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it working as a circuit anymore okay I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.389 
it working as a circuit anymore okay I
guess<00:01:44.100> that'll<00:01:44.610> work<00:01:44.869> i'll<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> work<00:01:46.350> um

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.039 

it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.520> working<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.090> normal<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.750> okay<00:01:54.750> yeah

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it is working as normal is it okay yeah

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.550 
it is working as normal is it okay yeah
it<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> okay<00:01:55.740> whatever<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:58.380> you're

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
it is okay whatever and then you're

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.940 
it is okay whatever and then you're
going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:58.799> your<00:01:58.979> circuit<00:02:00.469> then<00:02:01.469> you're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
going to take your circuit then you're

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
going to take your circuit then you're
going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.570> attach<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.880> Dawa<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> take

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
going to attach the Dawa going to take

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.309 
going to attach the Dawa going to take
this<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.409> you're<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> make<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.319> don't

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this and you're going to make it I don't

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.930 
this and you're going to make it I don't
know<00:02:10.379> if<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.590> matters<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.160> don't<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
know if this matters I don't think it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.850 
know if this matters I don't think it
does

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
does

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.530 
does
34<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:14.570> need<00:02:14.840> before<00:02:14.960> here<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.480> to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
34 you need before here and I'm going to

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.330 
34 you need before here and I'm going to
take<00:02:17.690> my<00:02:17.900> dispenser<00:02:18.410> here<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:19.100> because<00:02:19.220> I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
take my dispenser here just because I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.360 
take my dispenser here just because I
don't<00:02:19.580> have<00:02:19.610> another<00:02:19.880> one<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.150> me<00:02:20.420> please<00:02:20.960> i<00:02:21.140> do

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
don't have another one on me please i do

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.980 
don't have another one on me please i do
then<00:02:22.370> you're<00:02:22.490> going<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> take<00:02:22.730> your<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.750> their

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
then you're going to take your for their

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.740 
then you're going to take your for their
and<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.550> only<00:02:25.670> way<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:25.970> will<00:02:26.030> work<00:02:26.090> if

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and this is the only way it will work if

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.350 
and this is the only way it will work if
you<00:02:26.960> can<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.590> make<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:27.860> like<00:02:28.280> you're<00:02:29.240> also

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
you can if you make it like you're also

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.180 
you can if you make it like you're also
in<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.690> sec<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:31.310> make<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.640> like<00:02:32.800> if<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.980> make<00:02:34.160> it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
in a sec you make it like if you make it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.390 
in a sec you make it like if you make it
like<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.670> where<00:02:35.420> your<00:02:35.920> I've<00:02:36.920> already<00:02:37.160> tried

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
like this where your I've already tried

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.240 
like this where your I've already tried
making<00:02:37.820> me<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:39.040> where<00:02:40.040> they're

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
making me like this where they're

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.610 
making me like this where they're
connecting<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.940> goes<00:02:41.480> if<00:02:42.260> they're<00:02:42.500> not

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
connecting it goes if they're not

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.520 
connecting it goes if they're not
connecting<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:46.130> put<00:02:46.400> them<00:02:46.490> like<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
connecting you put them like that and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.680 
connecting you put them like that and
then<00:02:49.690> three<00:02:50.690> six<00:02:51.110> one<00:02:54.610> two<00:02:55.610> three<00:02:56.150> four<00:02:56.630> five

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
then three six one two three four five

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.940 
then three six one two three four five
six<00:02:57.170> seven<00:02:58.959> then<00:02:59.959> I'd<00:03:00.140> your<00:03:00.350> pressure<00:03:00.620> blade

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
six seven then I'd your pressure blade

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.660 
six seven then I'd your pressure blade
ah<00:03:01.900> add<00:03:02.900> your<00:03:03.170> pressure<00:03:03.410> plate<00:03:03.739> there<00:03:03.980> right

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
ah add your pressure plate there right

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.560 
ah add your pressure plate there right
here<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.870> connect<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.650> redstone<00:03:07.570> so

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
here and connect it with redstone so

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.090 
here and connect it with redstone so
when<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.870> step<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:11.420> goes<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.020> I<00:03:12.560> guess

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
when you step on it it goes and I guess

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.289 
when you step on it it goes and I guess
you<00:03:13.430> could<00:03:14.230> test<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:15.440> really<00:03:16.340> quickly<00:03:16.580> just

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
you could test this really quickly just

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.060 
you could test this really quickly just
