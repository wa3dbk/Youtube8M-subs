00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.580 

hello<00:00:10.080> friends<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.860> am<00:00:11.190> drippy<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.990> know<00:00:13.259> that

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
hello friends I am drippy you know that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.010 
hello friends I am drippy you know that
rain<00:00:13.889> makes<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.549> grass<00:00:14.849> green<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> makes

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
rain makes the grass green and it makes

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.010 
rain makes the grass green and it makes
your<00:00:16.199> garden<00:00:16.770> grow<00:00:17.160> hmm<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.690> ever

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
your garden grow hmm have you ever

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.040 
your garden grow hmm have you ever
wondered<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.920> makes<00:00:19.980> rain<00:00:20.820> though<00:00:21.330> let's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
wondered what makes rain though let's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.550 
wondered what makes rain though let's
learn<00:00:22.380> how<00:00:22.710> does<00:00:23.130> rain<00:00:23.400> form<00:00:24.199> first<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.410> will

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
learn how does rain form first we will

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.700 
learn how does rain form first we will
need<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> Sun<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> Sun<00:00:27.930> when<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
need the Sun so here is the Sun when the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.490 
need the Sun so here is the Sun when the
Sun<00:00:29.010> shines<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.699> heat<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> Sun<00:00:30.660> warms<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
Sun shines the heat of the Sun warms the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
Sun shines the heat of the Sun warms the
water<00:00:31.529> turning<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.880> invisible<00:00:33.239> gas

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
water turning it into an invisible gas

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.889 
water turning it into an invisible gas
called<00:00:34.170> water<00:00:34.559> vapour<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.790> process<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
called water vapour this process the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.729 
called water vapour this process the
changing<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> water<00:00:37.860> into<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> gas<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.940> called

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
changing of water into a gas is called

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
changing of water into a gas is called
evaporation<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:41.370> gas<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.239> lighter<00:00:42.540> than

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
evaporation because gas is lighter than

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.740 
evaporation because gas is lighter than
liquids<00:00:43.379> water<00:00:43.920> vapor<00:00:44.309> rises<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.270> into<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sky and they further move up into the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
sky and they further move up into the
way<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:49.079> Earth's<00:00:49.320> surface<00:00:49.550> due<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.820> the

way from Earth's surface due to the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.229 
way from Earth's surface due to the
