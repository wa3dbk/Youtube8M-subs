 already prepared eggplant jam so 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 that I will not tell everything in detail 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.779
 the only thing you need to choose 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.750
 small eggplants 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 brush the skin of 6 eggplants and put 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.510
 water until you finish the whole process this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.710
 don't you turn black even we will 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.760
 soak the promises of soda 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.870
 previous video all this was said and 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.870
 the recipe was posted 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.650
 cooking process 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.400
 exactly the same as in the previous one 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.570
 recipe 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.430
 two stages but the taste of this jam 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 completely different hobby that they have 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:17.320
 nuts are nuts give a special taste 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:23.830
 we start the inside of eggplant 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:30.789
 nuts or they fight nuts together 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:34.390
 must be mature no need for them 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:45.610
 there were only magate what if you can 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:48.479
 remove the skin from them sleep here we are cleared 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.479
 eggplants 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.830
 apply them under bends water semi-solid 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.880
 nuts to peel them off 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.180
 we blow the boiling water had warm water 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:13.030
 can even boiling water 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:19.510
 leave for 20 then with them is very easy 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:22.450
 will be put just skin 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.820
 have time while you have eggplant 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.650
 grown draws tea soda 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:34.540
 huskies will also be skinned with nuts 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.930
 would be elastic and comfortable was the meaning of sleep 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.930
 be 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.860
 next we wash our eggplants under 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.489
 running water and then cranes fuck and 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:03:00.480
 will stuff nuts are already 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:03:05.769
 sandpaper process a little bit 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:10.019
 tedious of course not like all 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:15.280
 previous we will have 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:21.940
 washed pressed collages neatly 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:25.959
 11 mid holes and invest invest 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:31.720
 me the secondary and nuts, we cut them 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:34.079
 so that they are relatives and are stuffed with 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.569
 both sides on the one and the other 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.519
 although it would be possible and cuts the tummy and 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.700
 put on the one whom genre 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.750
 but in this case when cooking the nuts are all 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.750
 swim out 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:54.120
 the taste will be right there but aesthetic 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:58.569
 a little bit spoiled 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:03.569
 stuffing nuts and the rest you have 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:08.739
 a lot of nuts you can drop them 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.530
 eggplant together they will stew not 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:17.829
 forget necessarily 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:23.760
 squeeze lemon juice means if you 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:28.599

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.650
 then they turn black brown 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.840
