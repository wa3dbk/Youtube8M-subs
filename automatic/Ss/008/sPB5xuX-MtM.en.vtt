00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
thing so it's not you know unmanageable

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.429 
thing so it's not you know unmanageable
I<00:00:20.130> had<00:00:21.060> read<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.720> would<00:00:21.900> happen<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
I had read that this would happen I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.660 
I had read that this would happen I
didn't<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.070> happen<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.369> early

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
didn't think it would happen this early

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
didn't think it would happen this early
we're<00:00:24.150> only<00:00:24.269> day<00:00:24.510> 5<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.199> maybe<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we're only day 5 so maybe it's just a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.000 
we're only day 5 so maybe it's just a
normal<00:00:26.189> backache<00:00:26.789> who<00:00:27.000> knows<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:28.470> seems<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
normal backache who knows it seems that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.659 
normal backache who knows it seems that
when<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.519> body<00:00:29.699> detoxifies<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:30.810> are

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
when the body detoxifies there are

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.330 
when the body detoxifies there are
toxins<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.030> tend<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.050> accumulate<00:00:34.649> near<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
toxins that tend to accumulate near the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.850 
toxins that tend to accumulate near the
spine<00:00:36.110> specifically<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> bottom<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
spine specifically the bottom of the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
spine specifically the bottom of the
spine<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.730> maybe<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.170> releasing

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
spine so maybe that's what I'm releasing

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.470 
spine so maybe that's what I'm releasing
or<00:00:40.860> starting<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> release<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
or starting to release it's actually a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.220 
or starting to release it's actually a
different<00:00:43.520> qualitatively<00:00:44.539> that's<00:00:45.539> well<00:00:45.899> said

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
different qualitatively that's well said

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
different qualitatively that's well said
it's<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.520> different<00:00:47.969> feeling<00:00:48.210> than<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it's actually a different feeling than a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.810 
it's actually a different feeling than a
normal<00:00:49.559> backache<00:00:50.129> there's<00:00:50.370> something<00:00:50.700> about

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
salt and what it does is because it has

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.640

the<00:02:16.870> same<00:02:17.170> density<00:02:17.860> as<00:02:18.160> your<00:02:18.910> blood<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:20.260> again

things completely off base this is what

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.170 
things completely off base this is what
I<00:02:24.819> remember<00:02:25.480> from<00:02:25.510> research<00:02:26.819> because<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.000> has

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the same density as your blood it does

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.040

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
that density also makes the body not

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.360 
that density also makes the body not
prone<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.209> picking<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.230> salt<00:02:38.500> either<00:02:39.160> in

who had water fasted for 40 days I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.280 
who had water fasted for 40 days I
claimed<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:06.100> not<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.700> this<00:03:06.910> at<00:03:07.209> all<00:03:07.569> which

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
claimed to not do this at all which

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.009 
claimed to not do this at all which
sounded<00:03:08.680> crazy<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.100> me<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.060> did<00:03:10.239> water<00:03:10.480> fast<00:03:10.750> he

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
sounded crazy to me so did water fast he

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.009 
sounded crazy to me so did water fast he
had<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.290> time<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:11.769> having<00:03:12.609> read<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.600> seems

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
had the time but having read it seems

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.660 
had the time but having read it seems
that<00:03:14.109> eighty<00:03:14.290> percent<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:15.040> what<00:03:15.250> we<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.519> in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
that eighty percent of what we have in

that eighty percent of what we have in
our<00:03:15.790> body<00:03:16.030> are<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.870> toxins<00:03:17.350> in<00:03:17.440> our<00:03:17.530> body<00:03:17.739> or

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
our body are the toxins in our body or

our body are the toxins in our body or
the<00:03:18.130> byproducts<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.180> stuff<00:03:19.690> waste

the byproducts and stuff waste

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.920 
the byproducts and stuff waste
essentially<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.480> evacuated<00:03:22.480> through<00:03:22.690> our

lungs<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.799> was<00:03:24.430> very<00:03:24.459> surprised<00:03:25.090> about<00:03:25.359> that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
lungs I was very surprised about that

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.990

our<00:03:25.780> breath<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:27.150> at<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.269> point<00:03:28.480> my<00:03:28.930> breath<00:03:29.260> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
our breath so at this point my breath is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.210 
our breath so at this point my breath is
probably<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.870> potency<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.440> being<00:03:32.799> able<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
probably the potency of being able to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.910 
probably the potency of being able to
make<00:03:33.579> flowers<00:03:34.030> wilt<00:03:34.470> I'm<00:03:35.470> not<00:03:35.680> quite<00:03:35.890> sure

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
make flowers wilt I'm not quite sure

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.520 
make flowers wilt I'm not quite sure
myself<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.180> haven't<00:03:37.600> held<00:03:37.870> my<00:03:38.079> friends

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
myself and I haven't held my friends

myself and I haven't held my friends
close<00:03:38.769> enough<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.280> breathe<00:03:39.609> in<00:03:39.730> their<00:03:39.880> face

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
close enough to breathe in their face

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.370 
close enough to breathe in their face
but<00:03:40.359> I<00:03:41.109> am<00:03:41.709> burning<00:03:42.070> my<00:03:42.670> fat<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.329> am<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:43.810> ketosis

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
but I am burning my fat I am in ketosis

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.349 
but I am burning my fat I am in ketosis
for<00:03:44.980> people<00:03:45.340> who<00:03:45.489> have<00:03:45.609> done<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.910> Atkins<00:03:46.269> diet

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
for people who have done the Atkins diet

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.440 
for people who have done the Atkins diet
which<00:03:47.290> means<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.640> burning<00:03:48.910> ketones

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
which means that I is it burning ketones

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.150 
which means that I is it burning ketones
or<00:03:49.660> producing<00:03:50.109> ketones<00:03:50.470> i'm<00:03:50.709> not<00:03:50.859> sure<00:03:51.130> but

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
or producing ketones i'm not sure but

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.699 
or producing ketones i'm not sure but
that<00:03:51.940> process<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.840> different<00:03:53.200> digestive
