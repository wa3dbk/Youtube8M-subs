00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.080
 dimension that has just found the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.080
 happiness 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.259
 hi to all youtubers here in sharq l e 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:25.180
 the official Italian trailer has been released 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:27.490
 it was fucking f so I would say a nice one 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.329
 video review of this trailer there 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.329
 is all you say 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.410
 incredibly in the trailer even though it is 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:43.180
 hard but worth a minute you can already 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:45.309
 hear the voices of freezer and frize no but 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.540
 incredibly also that of trans 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.809
 for how many beats say ego as it does a 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.010
 the little thing screamed in pain 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:03.059
 has left everyone puzzled, amazed but 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:06.880
 even pgt no longer quit keen interest 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.710
 high school this thing and who is there is in the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.080
 trailer the song of the TV series that makes 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.180
 you cut silhouette is wonderful ethics 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.860
 what the fuck is he doing here in the thriller 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.630
 beginning I wondered this no 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.120
 that is, as soon as I heard it I put it on 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.980
 pause the trailer the first time I have 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.240
 seen the 3 this morning the first thing 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:36.450
 I did silvio with the song 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.450
 I paused noste but what the fuck 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.229
 for so many minutes ok and we resume a 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.520
 see the trailer not very faithful then 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.040
 but apart from the fact that it makes me 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 pissed off because I wanted an epic trailer 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.090
 so also for patron long runs 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.090
 remember look at the end I arrived 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.220
 a bit to the conclusion that in my opinion 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.030
 they put the song in this trailer 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.560
 to understand two things first perhaps for 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.890
 make all those nostalgics excite me 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.750
 no but that in 3 is enough for us not to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 replace the original songs at 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.330
 movie because it got really pissed off 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.930
 second reason you are still camera 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.370
 shit second reason I think they want 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.080
 tell us that we must not demand a 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.690
 group of voice actor to that other ie 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 in the sense it does not matter who is doubling it 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.660
 we are all a family we are all 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.860
 good 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.780
 in fact it has an exceptional cast this 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.170
 heart of course I do some that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.170
 I break my balls 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.769
 oh well gianluca iacono will not be mica 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.769
 stayed so bad no 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.020
 Now I do the framing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.400
 bimbominkia share shaun chi vi 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.790
 I remember before he saw he was fucking good 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.790
 you have to watch 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.550
 clear no because it's not that it's not 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.220
 important and fundamental precisely for 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.590
 see the trailer for italian fucking 2f 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.300
 which we have just reviewed as that 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.099
 I keep calling a cock behind 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.430
 because it looks too good in that 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:26.470
 Japanese fuchs 1 f seems little was 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.860
 fucking f.ba okay better maximum 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750
 of the Italian title the resurrection of f 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.230
 probably friser was in crisis, it was 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.519
 had to sell the letters of the name 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.140
 so if you want to see the trailer ten 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.360
 I don't know if I just said that 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.549
 but numerical, however, I give a shit again and 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.860
 we see ourselves as always very high of 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.959
 make a video on dragon ball super thing 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.690
