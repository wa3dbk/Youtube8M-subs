00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.160 

and<00:01:13.310> you're<00:01:13.490> quite<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.759> different<00:01:14.180> sir<00:01:14.750> age

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
and you're quite a different sir age

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.270 
and you're quite a different sir age
difference<00:01:16.780> yeah<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:18.049> people<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:19.100> could

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
difference yeah to people you could

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.190 
difference yeah to people you could
arrange<00:01:19.549> around<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.119> mic<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.540> would<00:01:20.659> work<00:01:20.810> to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
arrange around this mic it would work to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.080 
arrange around this mic it would work to
acoustic<00:01:21.740> instruments<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.490> people<00:01:22.790> singing

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
acoustic instruments to people singing

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.450 
acoustic instruments to people singing
this<00:01:23.869> would<00:01:24.080> work<00:01:24.229> out<00:01:24.470> if<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.040> two<00:01:25.250> mics

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
this would work out if you have two mics

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.249 
this would work out if you have two mics
even<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.880> better<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.210> can<00:01:26.360> focus<00:01:26.600> one<00:01:26.899> mic<00:01:27.049> on

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
even the better you can focus one mic on

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.679 
even the better you can focus one mic on
the<00:01:27.369> acoustic<00:01:28.369> instrument<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.180> one<00:01:29.299> mic<00:01:29.479> on

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
the acoustic instrument and one mic on

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.570 
the acoustic instrument and one mic on
the<00:01:29.720> voice<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.289> if<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.439> have<00:01:30.530> one<00:01:30.710> like<00:01:30.920> you

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
the voice but if you have one like you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.529 
the voice but if you have one like you
can<00:01:31.729> actually<00:01:31.880> get<00:01:32.090> some<00:01:32.270> pretty<00:01:32.479> good

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
can actually get some pretty good

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:55.220 
can actually get some pretty good
results
