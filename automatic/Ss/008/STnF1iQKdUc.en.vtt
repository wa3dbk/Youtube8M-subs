00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.570
 Tell me the second part of the review here. 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.339
 no g4 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.400
 for those who lost the first one has a link 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 registration valley and the screen is the new 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 launch of samsung 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.530
 now with the cold the sound is that it has to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.410
 offer this version sold in Brazil 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.490
 with eco sons comes with an oil chip is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.230
 professional option which is the wm 5110 is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.910
 this is different from the version with the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.029
 snapdragon that does not come with this chip 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.529
 then the sound quality here in the model 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.109
 sold in Brazil is better than 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.270
 quantity sold is in the version out there 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.450
 so this is interesting for who 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.520
 enjoy a lot of music that explore is this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.430
 better is better shape with bigger 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.170
 a sound setting 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.969
 This makes more difference in the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.079
 heard on the loudspeaker does not 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.320
 difference in practice 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.140
 and speaking of him, samsung removed him 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.809
 from the bottom that was in the 3 played of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.789
 back in the back with a year night 21 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.079
 fortunately the sound still mono drum does not 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.079
 given here in his performance 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.499
 when I realize the sound is very powerful 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.960
 but unfortunately when it is over 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:28.509
 end table fan speaker with 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.869
 connection to the headset or even that 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.939
 comes in f5 and this here he owns is a 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.709
 drive size 12mm then 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.840
 this ensures that he has a good 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:40.929
 range in their frequency of 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.069
 response and offers good bass is the 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.170
 the balanced ones 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.569
 his son is flat on leaving prevents 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.849
 that embarrasses's interesting to stay 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.549
 I'm all connected and the 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:54.189
 shortcuts there for you to call and you 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.390
 volume control is with your headset. 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.069
 heard in general he is very weak but he is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.259
 within the acceptable one that comes 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.929
 with smartphone applications. 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.700
 samsung she gave a good improvement in the 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.319
 she also more complete 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.239
 with a cleaner and flatter interface 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.950
 approximated there than did pop idol 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.780
 here you have a shortcut for you 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.819
 connect with positive ones then with 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.010
 the sound of your car with your TV with your 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.500
 check it out then you have a connection 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.079
 to share your music and here 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.940
 in the options in some settings have 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.090
 these here you can configure the tabs 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.069
 of artists albums of genres and here 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.900
 you can create your playlists then 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.829
 you organize your lists is like you 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 displayed 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.620
 here you have an equalizer is the salgado 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 live tv as the profiles is classic come 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.269
 with pop rock jazz and then change accordingly 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.220
 with the song or you can set 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.349
 Manually you have caused pain of seven 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.389
 bands born with medium serious figures 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.299
 and sharp as you want you can 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.400
 create a 3d effect strengthen your bass 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.470
 or improve clarity and grandmas 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.940
 increasing the treble of sound 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.069
 another cool resource that you will 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.470
 find here or adapt where this 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.380
 already come from other galaxy and the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.950
 samsung kept in g4 and it serves to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.290
 calibrate your headset then it is the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.680
 sound is divided into tracks on tracks 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.720
 low frequency is medium and high only 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.129
 This varies from ear to person. 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.919
 some people can hear some 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.109
 tracks and other people not then this 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.269
 Calibrator it will remove the tracks that 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.639
 you can not hear and will focus only 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.840
 in those you listen to then it goes 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.519
 improve 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.050
 the quality Hungry according sound 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.030
 you are using so you can use 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.440
 a background to samsung or earphone that you 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.890
 have always remembered that you are 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.530
 to change your hunger, you better recalibrate to 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.269
 you better explore this capacity will 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.209
 beep then you will say that you 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.160
 listen or not this beep and from there it goes 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.739
 focus only on those tracks a resource 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.150
 It's very cool, I've already tested it. 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.580
 difference in sound quality is worth 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.360
 It's worth the test to calibrate the 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.569
 your 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.640
 in addition it is to display lyrics or music 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.099
 player and also the smart volume that 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.569
 on the sound of all the music goes 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.360
 getting everything even volume is a resource 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.069
 very cool here in general music player 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.290
 the top is very good 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.269
 generally rock and 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.419
 But this time here is worth a lot. 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.389
 It's worth using what comes in the four here 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.950
 Do you have a microphone and down here? 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.570
 You have two more then these. 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.810
 microphone is when you are recording a 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.690
 audio is an alcohol voice recorder is 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.000
 recording a video with the camera is a hand 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.340
 will pick up the left sound and the other side 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.729
 right and the third is to cancel 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.919
 the noises of your recordings I left 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.200
 an indoor environment worked very well 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.539
 and external environments he was able to 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.349
 one reduced is in the noise of the environment 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.349
 check out 1 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.460
 I will come back 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.550
 as he has to realize and reduced 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.250
 sound but still could hear the 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.420
 voices even with the noise of the wind and 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.130
 sound that it records is 256 kbps stereo from 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.590
 very good quality here in 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.740
 settings you can configure the 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.820
 vibration is for call notifications and 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.950
 a touch on the screen 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.560
 otherwise there is nothing much here these 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.320
 same settings you find 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.690
 a standard android plus the high 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.580
 front speaker provides you with a 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.650
 not a very loud sound very loud 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.550
 so to those who make lots of connections there 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.920
 will like the 4 for this and in general the 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.110
 sound very pleasing to him especially the ex 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.700
 thin that comes with a sound chip 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.410
 logical that to take full advantage of 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.020
 that offer you must have a 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.480
 handset quality and samsung is well 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.760
 and will not explore the whole 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.610
 power that this chip offers but 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.070
 Overall lot 4 really thrilled has a 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.110
 sound good both a headset and 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.910
 on the speaker and also the microphones 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.770
 they are very powerful and can 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.150
 filter the kids there well 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.100
 good guys doing the second part 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.100
 review and see you next time
