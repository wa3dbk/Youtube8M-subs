00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.970 
that's it the idea is not necessarily to
be<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> head<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> equator<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:13.349> not<00:02:13.560> too<00:02:13.739> far

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
be a head at the equator but not too far

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.370 
be a head at the equator but not too far
behind<00:02:14.099> either<00:02:14.600> my<00:02:15.600> objective<00:02:16.019> was<00:02:16.049> around

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
behind either my objective was around

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.420 
behind either my objective was around
the<00:02:16.530> 12<00:02:16.769> hours<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.970> would<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.239> nice
