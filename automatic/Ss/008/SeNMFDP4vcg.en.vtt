00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.780
 Once the schedule is 10 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.229

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.270
 time ends what you will find 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.610
 they know it's full their bucks fuck yesterday 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:31.759
 go up 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.479
 and how they see when the time in the game 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.940
 is 0 0 means that the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.850
 Event pokemons go back to the cave 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 and when a certain time is over, it is not going to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.820
 finish the moment that is in them 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.520

 They say it 's good, I do not know, it's 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.500
 I also think that surprise only with that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.630
 They expect nothing more and well here I am going to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.820

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.210

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.270
 intern here hopefully I have not entered late 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.580
 because when I came back from eating 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.430
 I saw all these piled up and when I 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 had gone there was no one there were only a few 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.580
 120 players now there are like 30 or 40 no 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.710

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.880

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.130
 there are no spaces that fuck they capture 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.580
 because when they were taken out they were 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.580
 enclosed 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.780
