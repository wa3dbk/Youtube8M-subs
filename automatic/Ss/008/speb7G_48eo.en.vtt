rear-wheel drive feel to the vehicle but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.620 
rear-wheel drive feel to the vehicle but
then<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.310> need<00:01:08.610> all-wheel<00:01:08.970> drive<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
then when we need all-wheel drive we can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950 
then when we need all-wheel drive we can
move<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> high<00:01:11.310> grip<00:01:12.000> surface<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.690> can<00:01:12.840> move

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
move on a high grip surface we can move

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
move on a high grip surface we can move
up<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> 60%<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> torque<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> front

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.250 
up to 60% to the torque to the front
axle<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.640> some<00:01:18.240> low<00:01:18.420> grip<00:01:18.630> surfaces

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
axle and then on some low grip surfaces

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.670 
axle and then on some low grip surfaces
were<00:01:19.410> able<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.540> transition<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.690> to<00:01:21.720> 100%<00:01:22.260> or

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
were able to transition up to 100% or

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
were able to transition up to 100% or
either<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.100> front<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> rear<00:01:23.610> axle<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
either the front or the rear axle if the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.370 
either the front or the rear axle if the
circumstances<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.610> such<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:28.170> their

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
circumstances are such that one their

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.070 
circumstances are such that one their
axle<00:01:28.770> has<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.190> low<00:01:29.369> grip<00:01:29.610> maybe<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.090> ice<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
axle has very low grip maybe on ice and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.440 
axle has very low grip maybe on ice and
the<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.380> axle<00:01:31.800> has<00:01:31.979> high<00:01:32.400> grip<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.330> then

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the other axle has high grip we can then

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.930 
the other axle has high grip we can then
move<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.960> bulk<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.040> drive<00:01:35.340> torque<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
move the bulk of the drive torque to the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.100 
move the bulk of the drive torque to the
axle<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.479> has<00:01:36.660> grip<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.520> gives<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
axle that has grip so it just gives you

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.350 
axle that has grip so it just gives you
much<00:01:40.110> more<00:01:40.140> flexibility<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.280> tuning<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
much more flexibility in tuning with the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.410 
much more flexibility in tuning with the
on-demand<00:01:42.630> system<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.400> move<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
on-demand system that you can move the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
on-demand system that you can move the
talk<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.840> where<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.260> required<00:01:46.860> when

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
talk to where it's really required when

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.790 
talk to where it's really required when
you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> low<00:01:48.030> grip<00:01:48.240> situation<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.620> then

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
you have a low grip situation but then

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.130 
you have a low grip situation but then
we<00:01:49.950> turn<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.220> car<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> existing<00:01:51.510> balance

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we turn the car to the existing balance

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.160 
we turn the car to the existing balance
rear-wheel<00:01:52.860> drive<00:01:52.890> nature<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.760> Jaguar<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
rear-wheel drive nature of Jaguar so you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
rear-wheel drive nature of Jaguar so you
get<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:55.590> enjoyable<00:01:56.159> driving<00:01:56.340> experience

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
get that enjoyable driving experience

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.800 
get that enjoyable driving experience
and<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:58.080> said<00:01:58.260> this<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> two-year<00:01:59.159> process

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and you said this was a two-year process

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.200 
and you said this was a two-year process
yeah<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.260> great<00:02:01.890> challenging<00:02:02.550> her

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
yeah it was great challenging her

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
yeah it was great challenging her
delivery<00:02:03.690> program<00:02:04.200> initially<00:02:04.620> was<00:02:04.950> set<00:02:05.159> out

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
delivery program initially was set out

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.469 
delivery program initially was set out
to<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:06.530> 2<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.710> 1/2<00:02:07.770> 34<00:02:08.130> years<00:02:08.790> but<00:02:09.179> there<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:09.450> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to be 2 and 1/2 34 years but there was a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.740 
to be 2 and 1/2 34 years but there was a
big<00:02:09.750> pressure<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.350> bring<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.979> forward<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.390> in

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
big pressure to bring that forward so in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.050 
big pressure to bring that forward so in
the<00:02:12.930> end<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.380> turned<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.400> be<00:02:14.519> two<00:02:14.760> years

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the end it turned out to be two years

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.090 
the end it turned out to be two years
from<00:02:15.480> program<00:02:16.440> start<00:02:16.769> two<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.880> delivery<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
from program start two to delivery so

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.280 
from program start two to delivery so
it<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:19.520> pretty<00:02:20.300> pretty<00:02:20.810> tough<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
it was pretty pretty tough and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.620 
it was pretty pretty tough and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
curious about the reaction people are

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.520 
curious about the reaction people are

got to years ago was that there's a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.060 
got to years ago was that there's a
really<00:02:35.180> strong<00:02:35.240> demand<00:02:36.020> for<00:02:36.470> improved

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
really strong demand for improved

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.700 
really strong demand for improved
traction<00:02:37.370> due<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> weather<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.320> adverse

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
traction due to the weather and adverse

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.160 
traction due to the weather and adverse
weather<00:02:39.890> conditions<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.670> winter<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
weather conditions in the winter and the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.100 
weather conditions in the winter and the
really<00:02:42.550> current<00:02:43.550> range<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:44.090> products<00:02:44.450> were

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
really current range of products were

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.710 
really current range of products were
not<00:02:45.290> really<00:02:45.740> usable<00:02:46.190> in<00:02:46.490> those<00:02:46.940> low<00:02:47.330> grip

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
not really usable in those low grip

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.650 
not really usable in those low grip
conditions<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:49.030> reason<00:02:50.030> we've<00:02:50.180> developed<00:02:50.600> a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
conditions so reason we've developed a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
conditions so reason we've developed a
system<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.680> provide<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.640> extra

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
system is to provide that extra

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.000 
system is to provide that extra
confidence<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.840> security<00:02:54.320> for<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.560> customer

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
confidence and security for the customer

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.300 
confidence and security for the customer
when<00:02:55.190> grip<00:02:56.120> conditions<00:02:56.660> at<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:56.990> that<00:02:57.740> doesn't

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
when grip conditions at all that doesn't

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.740 
when grip conditions at all that doesn't
detract<00:02:58.610> from<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.350> driving<00:03:00.350> experience<00:03:00.670> when

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
detract from the driving experience when

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.480 
detract from the driving experience when
when<00:03:02.750> you've<00:03:02.900> got<00:03:03.110> dry<00:03:03.320> tarmac<00:03:03.560> conditions<00:03:04.310> so

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
when you've got dry tarmac conditions so

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.370 
when you've got dry tarmac conditions so
that<00:03:04.640> was<00:03:04.790> really<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> balance<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.840> not

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
that was really the balance of not

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.800 
that was really the balance of not
losing<00:03:06.890> what<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> car<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.400> about<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.450> giving

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
losing what the car is about but giving

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.360 
losing what the car is about but giving
that<00:03:08.930> all-wheel<00:03:09.260> drive<00:03:09.500> confidence<00:03:10.100> when<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
that all-wheel drive confidence when the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.640 
that all-wheel drive confidence when the
customer<00:03:10.730> needs<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.180> think<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.170> tuning

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
customer needs it think that the tuning

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.670 
customer needs it think that the tuning
side<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.930> bit<00:03:15.440> that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
side of it is really the the bit that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.060 
side of it is really the the bit that
creates<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> character<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> car<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
creates the character of the car so the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.830 
creates the character of the car so the
mechanical<00:03:19.070> engineering<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:20.390> was<00:03:20.600> difficult

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
mechanical engineering it was difficult

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.570 
mechanical engineering it was difficult
to<00:03:21.170> fit<00:03:21.380> everything<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.950> because<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
to fit everything in because the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.120 
to fit everything in because the
platform<00:03:23.290> wasn't<00:03:24.290> engineered<00:03:24.440> from<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
platform wasn't engineered from the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.880 
platform wasn't engineered from the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
start from the original inception to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.830 
start from the original inception to
take<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.130> world<00:03:28.520> drive<00:03:28.820> so<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.240> get<00:03:29.450> all<00:03:29.600> of<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
take a world drive so to get all of the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.900 
take a world drive so to get all of the
components<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> was<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.710> real<00:03:30.950> mechanical

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
components it was a real mechanical

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.640 
components it was a real mechanical
challenge<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.020> think<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.320> thing<00:03:33.500> that

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
challenge but I think the thing that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.090 
challenge but I think the thing that
makes<00:03:34.660> brings<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.840> car<00:03:36.050> alive<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.740> gives<00:03:36.950> it

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
makes brings the car alive and gives it

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.340 
makes brings the car alive and gives it
its<00:03:37.220> character<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.970> really<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.510> controls<00:03:39.080> and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350
