00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 very good kids here we are a 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.549
 new video the schatz as you see 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.109
 I bring like to record cinematic in call 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.730
 of duty ghosts as you know there is no way 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.950
 cinema in this call of duty so what 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 they decided one is a bitch is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.030
 pretty fat for those who have to do 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.560
 mounts or for example troll mounts 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 some of these things are very 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 bad and it bothers everything but I do not have a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.660
 idea for those who want to make montages 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.130
 kinematic style and little things so it's 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.470
 quite interesting and good we are going to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.849
 create the game or do I do that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 we choose any map for example me 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.290
 I have taken prison break and then 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 game mode what you want I have 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.219
 put against all and you put it like that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.840
 will be perfect in options that 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.910
 we have to do in game options 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
 unlimited time the scoring limit 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.280
 in limited player actions and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.260
 none is worth team options here 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 we have to put any free and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.940
 activated as I have it and options for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.449
 heading here the important thing is advantages 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.050
 activated extreme mode activated this is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 very important then you will see why and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.400
 then this the rest and how is here what 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 you have to touch anything because if you do not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
 I would remove everything 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.810
 and modified and we're going to give you let's go 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 to play normal and good because we are already 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 here within the game and as you see 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 we are extremely and with the team not 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.640
 no brand comes out so we can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 do the kinematics and as you see 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 we have to face the team as I have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 done me and now down to the left 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.409
 you are watching observing that the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.270
 winning and points that can not be 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.800
 remove in any way he is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 testing and can not be removed so what 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 what we have to do is the following 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.369
 we take out the equipment written down again 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.500
 we take out the equipment and go down 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.990
 because in theory what is below is going to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.520
 remove then we take more plane from 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.800
 above the top of the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.690
 screen and let's do so we see it 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.119
 so we can do it with any site 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.039
 of the map or with any map as well 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.140
 in the part of the map that is more you like 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.030
 ok I think we're going here what 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.179
 we do the same we take the part of the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.770
 river and so we get back a bit of space or 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.080
 I can move it quickly then with the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.000
 slow motion in what's been the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.830
 sony vegas or the program you use 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.930
 to edit and well now the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.000
 you have here cinematic 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.400
 here on the river another cinematic by 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.400
 example this is how it is 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.530
 and well we have done three 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.599
 kinematics you can put players by 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.550
 example that I know you can put a 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.590
 friend of yours who runs on the map if 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.270
 come out like a sniper or something 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.760
 of those and now let's see when 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.040
 we put the effects in the editor that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 happens and how we visualize it we are going to 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.819
 see the results is not the same to see it 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 so you see that we have removed the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.880
 bottom part of the left with the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.959
 two black bands that we have put in the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 top of the screen in the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.160
 lower part and there remains a kinematics 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.170
 perfect for making your assemblies or 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.540
 Anything in the broth tutti 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.670
 well that would be all I hope that I have 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.950
 liked this tutorial I leave my hair in the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.410
 description in case you want to look at it or 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.150
 Anything to put in comments 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.440
 If you do not understand something and nothing 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.440
 we see in the next goodbye 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.670
 ah 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.670
 yes
