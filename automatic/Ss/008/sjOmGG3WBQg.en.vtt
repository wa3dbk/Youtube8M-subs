I want you to imagine that the jump
spell<00:01:44.220> has<00:01:44.370> sort<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> bull's-eye<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
spell has sort of a bull's-eye in the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
spell has sort of a bull's-eye in the
middle<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.010> get<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> bullseye

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
middle and you want to get that bullseye

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.610 
middle and you want to get that bullseye
right<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> halfway<00:01:48.630> point<00:01:49.110> between<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
right at that halfway point between the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.070 
right at that halfway point between the
two<00:01:49.800> rows<00:01:50.010> of<00:01:50.220> walls<00:01:50.480> basically<00:01:51.480> to<00:01:51.600> maximize

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
two rows of walls basically to maximize

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.200 
two rows of walls basically to maximize
the<00:01:52.230> amount<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.500> rows<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.980> can<00:01:53.130> jump<00:01:53.370> over<00:01:53.550> now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the amount of rows it can jump over now

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.520 
the amount of rows it can jump over now
you<00:01:54.270> might<00:01:54.540> also<00:01:54.690> want<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> place<00:01:55.170> your<00:01:55.320> jump

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you might also want to place your jump

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530 
you might also want to place your jump
spell<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> encompasses<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.550> t-junction<00:01:56.970> of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
spell so it encompasses a t-junction of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.930 
spell so it encompasses a t-junction of
walls<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.410> troops<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.980> jump<00:01:59.220> into<00:01:59.370> multiple

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
walls so troops can jump into multiple

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.640 
walls so troops can jump into multiple
compartments<00:02:00.300> alright<00:02:01.290> now<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.440> we<00:02:01.620> have

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
compartments alright now that we have

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.350 
compartments alright now that we have
the<00:02:01.800> basics<00:02:02.160> covered<00:02:02.370> I<00:02:02.640> want<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.060> show<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the basics covered I want to show you a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
the basics covered I want to show you a
really<00:02:03.600> interesting<00:02:03.990> raiding<00:02:04.560> strategy<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
really interesting raiding strategy that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280 
really interesting raiding strategy that
my<00:02:05.460> clan<00:02:05.730> mate<00:02:05.940> refers<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.300> as<00:02:06.630> jump<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
my clan mate refers to as jump in and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
my clan mate refers to as jump in and
jump<00:02:07.470> out<00:02:07.650> now<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> uses<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.970> goal<00:02:09.179> wipe

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
jump out now it uses the goal wipe

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.119 
jump out now it uses the goal wipe
composition<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.769> my<00:02:10.890> guide<00:02:11.099> to

composition and if you want my guide to

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.280 
composition and if you want my guide to
that<00:02:11.459> it'll<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:11.940> your<00:02:12.060> screen<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:13.019> instead

that it'll be on your screen but instead

that it'll be on your screen but instead
of<00:02:13.409> bringing<00:02:13.709> one<00:02:13.920> jump<00:02:14.220> spell<00:02:14.459> he<00:02:14.580> brings<00:02:14.819> two

of bringing one jump spell he brings two

of bringing one jump spell he brings two
jump<00:02:15.390> spells<00:02:15.659> now<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.409> logic<00:02:16.739> behind<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
jump spells now the logic behind the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
jump spells now the logic behind the
jump<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.700> jump<00:02:17.879> out<00:02:18.060> strategy<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
jump in jump out strategy is that with a

jump in jump out strategy is that with a
regular<00:02:19.530> goal<00:02:19.980> wipe<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.880> goal<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.450> get

regular goal wipe your goal is to get

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.000 
regular goal wipe your goal is to get
your<00:02:21.660> Pekka<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> core<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> base<00:02:22.740> to

your Pekka to the core of the base to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.170 
your Pekka to the core of the base to
take<00:02:23.190> out<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> townhall<00:02:23.850> fit

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.479 
take out the townhall fit
one<00:02:24.360> star<00:02:24.689> now<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> issue<00:02:25.799> with<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> goal

one star now but the issue with the goal

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.520 
one star now but the issue with the goal
wipe<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.879> sometimes<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.019> are<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.319> fact

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
wipe is sometimes if you are in fact

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.319 
wipe is sometimes if you are in fact
lucky<00:02:28.950> enough<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.250> take<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.459> Town<00:02:29.849> Hall<00:02:30.090> for

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
lucky enough to take that Town Hall for

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.630 
lucky enough to take that Town Hall for
that<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.629> star<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.560> challenge<00:02:32.099> is<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.610> make

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
that one star the challenge is to make

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.119 
that one star the challenge is to make
sure<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.180> clean<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.450> enough<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.200> base<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
sure you clean up enough of that base to

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.640 
sure you clean up enough of that base to
get<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.430> 50%<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.450> second<00:02:36.840> star<00:02:37.110> now

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
get that 50% for that second star now

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.289 
get that 50% for that second star now
often<00:02:37.980> times<00:02:38.010> your<00:02:38.280> pekka's<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.790> heroes<00:02:39.060> die

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
often times your pekka's and heroes die

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.789 
often times your pekka's and heroes die
in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> middle<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.200> base<00:02:40.379> because

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
in the middle of the base because

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.190 
in the middle of the base because
they're<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.340> little<00:02:41.640> kill<00:02:41.909> zone<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.420> all

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
they're in that little kill zone of all

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.500 
they're in that little kill zone of all
of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.439> surrounding<00:02:43.680> defences<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.329> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
of the surrounding defences so this is

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.970 
of the surrounding defences so this is
where<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.780> second<00:02:46.170> jump<00:02:46.319> spell<00:02:46.530> comes<00:02:46.769> into

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
where the second jump spell comes into

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.890 
where the second jump spell comes into
play<00:02:47.189> you<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.579> your<00:02:47.790> units<00:02:48.090> jump<00:02:48.329> out<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
play you have your units jump out of the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.509 
play you have your units jump out of the
core<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.349> try<00:02:49.859> to<00:02:49.920> pick<00:02:50.099> up<00:02:50.189> that<00:02:50.340> extra

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
core and try to pick up that extra

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.910 
core and try to pick up that extra
percentage<00:02:51.060> now<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.049> tactic<00:02:52.470> not<00:02:52.620> only

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
percentage now this tactic not only

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.559 
percentage now this tactic not only
really<00:02:53.280> helps<00:02:53.519> out<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.670> clan<00:02:54.000> wars<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.480> in

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
really helps out in clan wars and in

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.809 
really helps out in clan wars and in
trophy<00:02:54.930> pushing<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.890> also<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.340> farming

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
trophy pushing but also in farming

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.460 
trophy pushing but also in farming
because<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.540> allows<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.260> opportunity

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
because this allows you the opportunity

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.520 
because this allows you the opportunity
to<00:02:58.889> destroy<00:02:59.549> additional<00:03:00.389> gold<00:03:00.750> elixir<00:03:01.500> or

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
to destroy additional gold elixir or

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.670 
to destroy additional gold elixir or
even<00:03:02.040> dark<00:03:02.280> elixir<00:03:02.459> storages<00:03:03.090> by<00:03:03.870> jumping<00:03:04.530> out

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
even dark elixir storages by jumping out

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.710 
even dark elixir storages by jumping out
of<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.920> core<00:03:05.159> of<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.280> base<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.359> I<00:03:06.389> think<00:03:06.510> this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
of the core of the base so I think this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.569 
of the core of the base so I think this
is<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> very<00:03:07.170> unique<00:03:07.530> tactic<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.129> as<00:03:08.310> mentioned

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
is a very unique tactic now as mentioned

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.670 
is a very unique tactic now as mentioned
earlier<00:03:08.879> this<00:03:09.239> will<00:03:09.480> help<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.870> add<00:03:10.019> about<00:03:10.349> 10

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
earlier this will help to add about 10

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.670 
earlier this will help to add about 10
to<00:03:10.829> 20%<00:03:11.159> extra<00:03:11.670> damage<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.389> a<00:03:12.480> base<00:03:13.200> compared

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
to 20% extra damage on a base compared
