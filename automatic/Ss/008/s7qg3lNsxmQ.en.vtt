everything<00:02:17.930> goes<00:02:18.079> like<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:20.510> know<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
everything goes like you know the the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.960 
everything goes like you know the the
ground<00:02:21.500> sort<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.859> suddenly<00:02:22.130> disappears<00:02:22.730> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
ground sort of suddenly disappears and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.180 
ground sort of suddenly disappears and
you're<00:02:23.090> you're<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.870> air<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.739> found

from London to Timbuktu starting with

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.220 
from London to Timbuktu starting with
our<00:02:40.370> first<00:02:40.640> major<00:02:40.940> mission<00:02:41.359> very<00:02:41.660> early<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.019> in

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
our first major mission very early on in

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.680 
our first major mission very early on in
their<00:02:42.350> thing<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.709> across<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> channel

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
their thing it's across the channel

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.780 
their thing it's across the channel
next<00:02:44.690> thing<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:44.870> flying<00:02:45.709> across<00:02:46.130> France<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
next thing is flying across France and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.759 
next thing is flying across France and
then<00:02:47.329> done<00:02:47.570> over<00:02:48.049> for<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.260> Pyrenees<00:02:48.590> we'll

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
then done over for the Pyrenees we'll

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.560 
then done over for the Pyrenees we'll
probably<00:02:48.890> have<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.549> flap<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.880> about<00:02:50.000> 9,000

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
probably have to flap to about 9,000

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.840 
probably have to flap to about 9,000
feet<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.620> cross<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.950> cross<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> mountains<00:02:52.730> in

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
feet to cross the cross the mountains in

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.729 
feet to cross the cross the mountains in
the<00:02:52.880> in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> Pyrenees<00:02:53.570> which<00:02:54.079> is<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> be

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
the in the Pyrenees which is going to be

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.569 
the in the Pyrenees which is going to be
the<00:02:54.829> middle<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.100> winter<00:02:55.190> they're<00:02:55.400> all<00:02:55.459> gonna

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
the middle of winter they're all gonna

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.979 
the middle of winter they're all gonna
be<00:02:55.670> covered<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:55.970> snow<00:02:56.239> we're<00:02:56.720> gonna<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.930> to

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
be covered in snow we're gonna have to

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.330 
be covered in snow we're gonna have to
choose<00:02:57.200> our<00:02:57.350> route<00:02:57.500> carefully<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.159> if<00:02:58.250> we

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
choose our route carefully so that if we

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.399 
choose our route carefully so that if we
do<00:02:58.489> have<00:02:58.670> any<00:02:58.819> mechanical<00:02:59.000> problems<00:02:59.810> we<00:03:00.200> can

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
do have any mechanical problems we can

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.770 
do have any mechanical problems we can
actually<00:03:00.739> go<00:03:00.920> down<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.370> land<00:03:01.489> some

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
actually go down and land some

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.750 
actually go down and land some
safely<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.980> then<00:03:03.100> once<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.340> got<00:03:03.430> over<00:03:03.580> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
safely and then once we got over that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.520 
safely and then once we got over that
we'll<00:03:03.940> be<00:03:04.060> heading<00:03:04.300> down<00:03:04.420> through<00:03:04.660> Spain<00:03:04.930> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
we'll be heading down through Spain and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.380 
we'll be heading down through Spain and
our<00:03:05.770> next<00:03:06.100> big<00:03:06.250> challenge<00:03:06.430> one<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.060> them<00:03:07.180> I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
our next big challenge one of them I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.430 
our next big challenge one of them I
think<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.690> our<00:03:07.810> biggest<00:03:08.020> challenge<00:03:08.350> is

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
think one of our biggest challenge is

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.199 
think one of our biggest challenge is
crossing<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.800> Straits<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.100> Gibraltar

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
crossing the Straits of Gibraltar

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.350 
crossing the Straits of Gibraltar
because<00:03:10.209> that's<00:03:10.390> quite<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> big<00:03:11.560> distance<00:03:12.360> it's

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
because that's quite a big distance it's

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.699 
because that's quite a big distance it's
over<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> really<00:03:13.959> treacherous<00:03:14.170> bill<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> see

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
over a really treacherous bill to see

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.490 
over a really treacherous bill to see
huge<00:03:15.280> currents<00:03:15.760> there<00:03:15.940> we<00:03:16.690> really<00:03:16.959> ideally

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
huge currents there we really ideally

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.449 
huge currents there we really ideally
should<00:03:17.560> have<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.740> support<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.280> case

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
should have a support for it in case

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.920 
should have a support for it in case
something<00:03:18.730> goes<00:03:18.819> wrong<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.060> we<00:03:19.239> need<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.480> lay

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
something goes wrong and we need to lay

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.680 
something goes wrong and we need to lay
it<00:03:19.989> out<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:21.160> once<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.430> get<00:03:21.489> into<00:03:21.640> Africa<00:03:22.060> then

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it out and once we get into Africa then

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.470 
it out and once we get into Africa then
a<00:03:23.230> real<00:03:23.830> big<00:03:24.430> part<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.819> adventure<00:03:25.030> begins

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
a real big part of the adventure begins

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.150 
a real big part of the adventure begins
because<00:03:25.690> we'll<00:03:25.930> be<00:03:25.959> crossing<00:03:26.380> wild

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
because we'll be crossing wild

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.340
