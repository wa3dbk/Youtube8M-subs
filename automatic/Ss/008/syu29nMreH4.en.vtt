god gree what have you done what have
you<00:03:03.810> done<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.590> looks<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:04.890> an<00:03:05.070> earth<00:03:05.310> for

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
you done this looks like an earth for

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.570 
you done this looks like an earth for
sure<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> has<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> red<00:03:08.370> glow

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
not even gonna say anything cuz that's

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.170 
not even gonna say anything cuz that's
how<00:03:16.110> bad<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.769> there<00:03:20.220> are<00:03:20.250> two<00:03:21.000> more

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
how bad it is so there are two more

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.210 
how bad it is so there are two more
ethics<00:03:21.600> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.560> run<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> screen<00:03:23.190> right

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
ethics on the run on the screen right

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.580 
ethics on the run on the screen right
now<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:23.970> um<00:03:25.489> they<00:03:26.489> could<00:03:27.200> well<00:03:28.200> they<00:03:28.380> are

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590
