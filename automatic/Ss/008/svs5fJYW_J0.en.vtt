that<00:00:13.410> there<00:00:13.650> are<00:00:13.799> people<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.160> may<00:00:14.490> deserve

it<00:00:15.000> more<00:00:15.210> than<00:00:15.269> him<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:16.350> could<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.800> true<00:00:17.130> but

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
it more than him which could be true but

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
it more than him which could be true but
I<00:00:17.820> think<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.680> with<00:00:19.680> all<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.070> he's

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I think that with all that he's

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.099 
I think that with all that he's
accomplished<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.359> becoming<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> first

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109

accomplished and becoming the first
african-american<00:00:22.430> president<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.810> he's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
african-american president and all he's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.689 
african-american president and all he's
trying<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.099> people<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.580> our

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
trying to do for the people of our

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.240 
trying to do for the people of our
country<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> world<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.920> he<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
country and of the world that he is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
country and of the world that he is
deserving<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> award<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.660> guess<00:00:31.140> given<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
deserving of the award I guess given the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
deserving of the award I guess given the
nature<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> ward<00:00:32.489> potentially<00:00:33.030> well<00:00:33.390> I'm

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
nature of the ward potentially well I'm

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.180

not<00:00:34.020> sold<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.770> far<00:00:34.950> no<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.969> think<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.890> was

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
not sold on it so far no I think it was

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.770

given<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> him<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.309> symbol<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.780> what

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
given to him more as a symbol for what

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
given to him more as a symbol for what
he<00:00:42.870> stands<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> country<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.910> trying

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
he stands for what the country is trying

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.950 
he stands for what the country is trying
to<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.340> less<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:48.120> actual

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to do and less for for actual

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560 
to do and less for for actual
achievement<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.090> why<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.360> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.360 
achievement I do why do you think so
because<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
because I do think that it's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.270 
because I do think that it's
forward-thinking<00:00:54.030> um<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.379> believe<00:00:56.010> that

think he can create a sense of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.770 
think he can create a sense of
international<00:01:07.409> peace<00:01:08.270> yes<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.010> why

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
international peace yes I think so why

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
international peace yes I think so why
just<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.680> I've<00:01:13.890> seen<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.400> far<00:01:14.640> as

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
just because of what I've seen as far as

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
just because of what I've seen as far as
his<00:01:14.939> commitment<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> he<00:01:16.439> finds

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
his commitment to things that he finds

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
his commitment to things that he finds
important<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> country<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.330> don't<00:01:18.960> know

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
important for the country I don't know

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.260 
important for the country I don't know
if<00:01:19.170> any<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.770> person<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.340> create<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> sense<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
if any one person can create a sense of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
if any one person can create a sense of
international<00:01:21.900> peace<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.580> he

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
international peace but I think if he

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
international peace but I think if he
sees<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> call<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> action<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.470> try<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
sees this as a call to action to try to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
sees this as a call to action to try to
bring<00:01:25.979> folks<00:01:26.280> together<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.970> terms<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.360> world

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
bring folks together in terms of world

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
peace and that's all the better for

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.120 
peace and that's all the better for
everyone<00:01:29.310> yes<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.320> why<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.860> i

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
think it's a award recognizing what he's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
think it's a award recognizing what he's
accomplished<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.920> change<00:01:38.130> he's<00:01:38.400> brought
