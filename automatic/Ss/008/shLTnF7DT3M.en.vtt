 there were not enough cars 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.540
 so in 1957 including in the city 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.269

 requests from workers, its upper part is for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 ease of landing was folding 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.289
 scooter is much more convenient than a motorcycle 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 let him have a small ten inch 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.690
 wheels are designed for good coverage 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.390
 but he perfectly protects the driver from 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 mud landing like a chair on the front 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.610
 the dirtiest engine is closed by the hood 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 motor small volume of only 200 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 cubic centimeters stroke length 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 push-pull power of 9 horsepower 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.210
 a little more than a loner this one 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 fan forcibly drives air 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.400

 12-volt dyne starter as is clear from 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.180
 titles he is capable 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 and generate electricity and run 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 motor it was an innovation so far 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.040
 all Soviet two-wheeled vehicles 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.380
 kickstarter run 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.420
 start-up procedure according to the instructions 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.399

 I pull the gas handle forward to the end 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.350

 double-shouldered gait pedal 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.470
 this scooter is almost the same as 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.479
 lonely stroller light and does not burden 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 him but there is a significant difference in 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.070
 driving before turning especially 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.350
 before the right one has to slow down a lot 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.489
 speed after all wheelchairs and seeks 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.069

 if the passenger is sitting in the cradle 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.400
 some cars can be changed a little 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.739
 faster 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.299
 go through industrial production 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.900
 it never came 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:26.110
 from 280 thousand scooters tula 200 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.709
 wheelchairs were equipped with less than two hundred 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.709
 Apparently the novelty was recognized as unpromising.
