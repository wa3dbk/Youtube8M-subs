the water maker simultaneously with

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.290 
the water maker simultaneously with
running<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.519> engine<00:03:26.910> we're<00:03:27.030> going<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.209> run

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
running the engine we're going to run

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.390 
running the engine we're going to run
the<00:03:27.390> engine<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:27.959> about<00:03:28.230> two<00:03:28.680> or<00:03:28.709> three<00:03:28.920> hours

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the engine for about two or three hours

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.699 
the engine for about two or three hours
make<00:03:30.209> sure<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.569> a<00:03:30.630> good<00:03:30.660> full<00:03:31.140> charge<00:03:31.440> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
make sure we get a good full charge and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.759 
make sure we get a good full charge and
the<00:03:31.769> batteries<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.170> won't<00:03:34.319> have<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.590> run

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
the batteries that we won't have to run

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.809 
the batteries that we won't have to run
it<00:03:34.890> again<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.370> another<00:03:35.519> week<00:03:35.819> five<00:03:36.660> days

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.479 

so<00:03:39.329> that's<00:03:39.510> cool<00:03:39.719> that's<00:03:40.049> good<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.530> really<00:03:41.340> wish

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
so that's cool that's good I really wish

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.770 
so that's cool that's good I really wish
the<00:03:41.640> solar<00:03:41.849> panels<00:03:42.209> were<00:03:42.329> working<00:03:42.629> because

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
the solar panels were working because

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
otherwise if they were working we would

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.390 
otherwise if they were working we would
not<00:03:44.849> have<00:03:44.909> to<00:03:45.180> run<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.420> engine<00:03:45.719> at<00:03:45.870> all<00:03:46.250> but<00:03:47.250> if

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
not have to run the engine at all but if

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.760 
not have to run the engine at all but if
we'd<00:03:47.549> be<00:03:47.730> just<00:03:47.939> sitting<00:03:48.150> around<00:03:48.269> Bobby

probably<00:04:17.940> farther<00:04:18.150> than<00:04:18.360> that<00:04:18.420> but<00:04:18.780> anyhow

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
probably farther than that but anyhow

I'm<00:04:19.620> not<00:04:19.770> going<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:19.980> run<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> engine<00:04:20.280> more

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
I'm not going to run the engine more

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.310 
I'm not going to run the engine more
than<00:04:20.790> absolutely<00:04:21.239> necessary<00:04:21.360> to<00:04:21.959> charge<00:04:22.200> the

than absolutely necessary to charge the
batteries

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
batteries

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.450 
batteries
rewiring<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.690> solar<00:04:24.900> house

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.330 

the<00:04:28.330> solar<00:04:28.570> panel<00:04:28.930> situation<00:04:29.530> bothers<00:04:29.949> me

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.430 

clearly<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.669> 3dep<00:04:34.419> connector<00:04:34.960> had<00:04:35.080> become

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
clearly the 3dep connector had become

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.239 
clearly the 3dep connector had become
corroded

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
corroded

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.579 
corroded
that<00:04:37.789> was<00:04:37.969> what<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.479> thought<00:04:38.569> was<00:04:39.049> the<00:04:39.199> complete

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:39.589 
that was what I thought was the complete

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:43.779 
that was what I thought was the complete
problem<00:04:40.069> so<00:04:40.849> I<00:04:41.019> took<00:04:42.019> that<00:04:42.229> out<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.829> splice

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
problem so I took that out and splice

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.849 
problem so I took that out and splice
the<00:04:43.969> wires<00:04:44.149> direct<00:04:44.659> to<00:04:45.469> the<00:04:45.589> charge

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:45.859 
the wires direct to the charge

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:47.279 
the wires direct to the charge
controller

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
controller

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.839 
controller
but<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.770> charge<00:04:48.039> controller<00:04:48.399> is<00:04:48.669> not

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
but the charge controller is not

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.109 
but the charge controller is not
indicating<00:04:49.449> any<00:04:49.599> current<00:04:49.990> going<00:04:50.139> through<00:04:50.259> so

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:51.119 
indicating any current going through so

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.779 
indicating any current going through so
something<00:04:52.119> else<00:04:52.270> is<00:04:52.479> wrong<00:04:53.399> wiring<00:04:54.399> became

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
something else is wrong wiring became

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.670 
something else is wrong wiring became
with<00:04:55.059> the<00:04:55.270> solar<00:04:55.509> panels<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.139> not<00:04:56.319> marine

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
with the solar panels is not marine

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.930 
with the solar panels is not marine
grade<00:04:56.949> wiring

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.240 

but<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.630> has<00:05:00.780> been<00:05:00.990> working<00:05:01.230> for<00:05:01.440> more<00:05:02.070> than

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
but it has been working for more than

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.679 
but it has been working for more than
four<00:05:02.460> years<00:05:02.490> so

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 
four years so

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.109 
four years so
I<00:05:04.749> don't<00:05:05.439> know<00:05:05.499> we<00:05:05.619> get<00:05:05.709> to<00:05:05.860> Hawaii<00:05:05.919> we'll<00:05:06.549> call

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:07.119 
I don't know we get to Hawaii we'll call

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.779 
I don't know we get to Hawaii we'll call
the<00:05:07.360> supplier<00:05:07.779> and<00:05:08.189> see<00:05:09.189> if<00:05:09.249> we<00:05:09.339> can<00:05:09.489> work<00:05:09.639> it

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
the supplier and see if we can work it

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.239 
the supplier and see if we can work it
out<00:05:09.879> maybe<00:05:10.869> replace<00:05:11.289> those<00:05:11.649> with<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.039> newer

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:12.249 
out maybe replace those with the newer

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.889 
out maybe replace those with the newer
model<00:05:12.699> it's<00:05:12.849> a<00:05:12.939> little<00:05:13.119> bit<00:05:13.209> less<00:05:13.419> but<00:05:13.569> the

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:13.899 
model it's a little bit less but the

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:15.449 
model it's a little bit less but the
newer<00:05:14.079> model<00:05:14.469> of<00:05:14.529> the<00:05:14.619> same<00:05:14.799> panel<00:05:15.189> is<00:05:15.249> about

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:15.459 
newer model of the same panel is about

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:17.939 
newer model of the same panel is about
20%<00:05:15.729> more<00:05:16.149> efficient<00:05:16.569> so<00:05:16.779> it<00:05:17.709> may<00:05:17.889> be

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
20% more efficient so it may be

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.660 
20% more efficient so it may be
worthwhile<00:05:18.219> just<00:05:18.639> replacing<00:05:19.149> them

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.300 

but<00:05:22.270> it's<00:05:22.480> it's<00:05:22.770> bothersome<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.920> have<00:05:24.040> to<00:05:24.160> run

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
but it's it's bothersome you have to run

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.019 
but it's it's bothersome you have to run
the<00:05:24.400> engine<00:05:24.760> we<00:05:24.850> didn't<00:05:25.060> really<00:05:25.240> want<00:05:25.450> to

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.029 
the engine we didn't really want to

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:27.879 
the engine we didn't really want to
not<00:05:26.569> there's<00:05:26.839> a<00:05:26.869> problem<00:05:27.169> because<00:05:27.529> we<00:05:27.769> have

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
not there's a problem because we have

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.559 
not there's a problem because we have
plenty<00:05:28.039> of<00:05:28.219> fuel<00:05:28.519> yeah

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
plenty of fuel yeah

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.110 
plenty of fuel yeah
50%<00:05:31.319> more<00:05:31.740> fuel<00:05:32.069> than<00:05:32.099> we<00:05:32.460> had<00:05:32.610> come<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:32.970> the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
50% more fuel than we had come in the

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.900 
50% more fuel than we had come in the
other<00:05:33.240> direction<00:05:33.949> and<00:05:34.949> we<00:05:35.190> expect<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.669> trick

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
other direction and we expect the trick

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.420 
other direction and we expect the trick
to<00:05:36.060> be<00:05:36.180> only<00:05:36.300> half<00:05:36.599> as<00:05:37.050> long<00:05:37.259> in<00:05:37.590> time

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
to be only half as long in time

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.219 
to be only half as long in time
we<00:05:39.880> also<00:05:40.030> had<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.389> run<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.630> engine<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.990> charge

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
we also had to run the engine to charge

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.149 
we also had to run the engine to charge
the<00:05:41.380> battery<00:05:41.710> on<00:05:41.830> that<00:05:41.860> trip<00:05:42.250> because

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
the battery on that trip because

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.860 
the battery on that trip because
the<00:05:43.429> cloud<00:05:43.789> coverage

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
the cloud coverage

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.570 
the cloud coverage
you<00:05:45.020> know<00:05:45.140> this<00:05:45.410> trip<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.040> far<00:05:46.070> has<00:05:46.520> been

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
you know this trip so far has been

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.269 
you know this trip so far has been
pretty<00:05:46.700> clear<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.840> we<00:05:48.080> expected<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.650> be<00:05:48.680> just

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
pretty clear and we expected to be just

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.670 
pretty clear and we expected to be just
clear<00:05:50.849> and<00:05:51.029> sunny<00:05:51.149> the<00:05:51.299> rest<00:05:51.569> of<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:51.719> way<00:05:51.839> now

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
clear and sunny the rest of the way now

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.580 
clear and sunny the rest of the way now
expect<00:05:53.490> there<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.639> be<00:05:53.729> any<00:05:53.940> more<00:05:54.120> problems

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.070 

proceeding<00:05:58.370> under<00:05:58.520> power<00:05:58.820> and<00:05:59.420> approximately

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
proceeding under power and approximately

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.279 
proceeding under power and approximately
six<00:06:00.500> thoughts

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
six thoughts

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:08.810 
six thoughts
encores<00:06:03.249> were<00:06:03.580> about<00:06:03.849> 1,500<00:06:04.809> miles<00:06:04.990> from<00:06:05.110> oi

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.950 

luck<00:06:09.060> will<00:06:09.270> be<00:06:09.300> there<00:06:09.570> to<00:06:09.750> eat

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.570 

I<00:06:15.020> can<00:06:15.740> almost<00:06:15.919> see<00:06:17.560> Haleakala
