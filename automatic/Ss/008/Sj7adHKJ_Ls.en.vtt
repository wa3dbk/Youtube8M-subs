Nakia<00:00:42.270> representative<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.890> anything

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
Nakia representative is there anything

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.299 
Nakia representative is there anything
else<00:00:44.370> you're<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> cover<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.189 

you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.550> two<00:00:50.789> SIM<00:00:51.059> cards<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.719> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
you can have two SIM cards actually in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.590 
you can have two SIM cards actually in
the<00:00:52.350> device<00:00:52.649> itself<00:00:53.160> once<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the device itself once it's just the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
the device itself once it's just the
sides<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.770> also<00:00:56.070> sits<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> back

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
sides here and one also sits in the back

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
sides here and one also sits in the back
of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> device<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:58.379> best<00:00:58.620> thing<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
of the device the best thing about this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.279 
of the device the best thing about this
Joyce<00:00:59.520> M<00:00:59.760> device<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.899> store<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
Joyce M device is it can store up to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
Joyce M device is it can store up to
five<00:01:01.980> different<00:01:02.340> SIM<00:01:02.730> card<00:01:03.000> settings

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
five different SIM card settings

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.359 
five different SIM card settings
so<00:01:04.110> essentially<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.769> could<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> SIM<00:01:05.339> card

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so essentially you could have a SIM card

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
so essentially you could have a SIM card
for<00:01:05.700> data<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.570> SIM<00:01:06.780> card<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.229> text<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for data and a SIM card for text and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500 
for data and a SIM card for text and
voice<00:01:07.830> only<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.030> switch<00:01:09.299> between

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
voice only and you can switch between

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
voice only and you can switch between
the<00:01:09.780> two<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.229> could<00:01:10.619> switch<00:01:10.860> over<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.280> another

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the two I could switch over into another

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
the two I could switch over into another
two<00:01:11.880> SIM<00:01:12.090> cards<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.290> automatically

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
two SIM cards and it's automatically

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.399 
two SIM cards and it's automatically
saved<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.400> settings<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.150> me<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:16.259> you've

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
saved and settings for me what you've

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890

single-handed<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:37.650> what<00:05:37.800> you'll<00:05:37.950> notice

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
single-handed so what you'll notice

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.040 
single-handed so what you'll notice
there<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:38.880> each<00:05:39.060> of<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.330> keys<00:05:39.540> is<00:05:39.870> just

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
there is that each of the keys is just

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.190 
there is that each of the keys is just
very<00:05:40.290> slightly<00:05:40.800> raised<00:05:41.190> off<00:05:41.900> which<00:05:42.900> makes

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
very slightly raised off which makes

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.170 
very slightly raised off which makes
actually<00:05:43.680> tapping<00:05:44.070> on<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.280> screen<00:05:44.400> really

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180
