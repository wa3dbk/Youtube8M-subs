down from a 5-minute starting time this

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.450 
down from a 5-minute starting time this
would<00:04:26.950> be<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.100> 5-minute<00:04:27.700> whoops<00:04:27.910> game<00:04:29.460> again

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
would be a 5-minute whoops game again
