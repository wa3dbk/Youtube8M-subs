00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.780
 the guys and we're going to study how to do 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.740
 this well flies pretty good and good 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 whatever 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:26.450
 good once it understand 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.180
 considered the forms are the link 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.920
 and once all the forms are cut 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.590
 well I have done a couple of details what 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.100
 I've painted 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.879
 and good 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.949
 then we see the wing this part what 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.949
 You have to go looking plaintiff 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 and I alone 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.690
 behind good 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:17.580
 I cut this piece from here, you see 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.570
 so that it rises upwards it rises 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.570
 the clearing 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.740
 these two parts you will ask why 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.040
 I really hope it 's the most 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.430
 important of all this part is put 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.430
 cut 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.640
 all the other 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.570
 and it is that you have to stay like this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.570
 I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.060
 you will ask what is this and this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.690
 is to calibrate the had we already have the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.090
 same equilibrium as I here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.090
 I choose half of the waves 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.840
 how are they? 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:25.489
 it's right now it 's balanced 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.489
 and this good and 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:34.030
 and we go to some hardware stores 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.840
 they sell pressure plates of those that come 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.040
 10 grams 5 grams and once good 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.860
 more or less if you see that it dries like this 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 so much you put him 1 of 5 and I have 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.520
 that 1 out of 5 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.040
 and later 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.900
 if you still see that it falls a little if you do not 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.600
 you put half of five are half two 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:07.940
 it would be 250 grams 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.940
 and then good then 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.300
 well, now 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.230
 is everything now would be one 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.180
 remove the details and well I'll go 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.810
 to see the flight tests 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.480
 we're here and we're going to do the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.030
 shooting practice 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.290
 here 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.290
 and cardboard
