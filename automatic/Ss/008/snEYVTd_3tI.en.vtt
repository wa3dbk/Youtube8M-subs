what kind of clay I use and I only use
sculpey<00:00:31.140> products<00:00:31.679> now<00:00:32.070> there's<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> reason

sculpey products now there's a reason
for<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.960> sculpey<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
for that and that's because sculpey is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.549 
for that and that's because sculpey is
really<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.910> easy<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.390> work<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.630> first<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
really really easy to work with first of

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.959 
really really easy to work with first of
all<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> color<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.370> come<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.940> your

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

hands

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
hands

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
hands
secondly<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.590> open<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> pack<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.460> two<00:00:41.730> weeks

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
secondly if I open a pack in two weeks

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
secondly if I open a pack in two weeks
later<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.300> decide<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.960> back<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.469> another

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
later I decide to go back and do another

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
later I decide to go back and do another

you're<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> mix<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.329> white

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
you're going to mix it with your white

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.240 
you're going to mix it with your white
so<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.170> ratio<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> have

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
so the first ratio is going to have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.190 
so the first ratio is going to have
equal<00:01:50.729> parts<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> purple<00:01:51.479> equal<00:01:51.869> parts<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
equal parts of purple equal parts of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.300 
equal parts of purple equal parts of
white<00:01:52.409> mix<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> up

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.760 

and<00:01:55.399> only<00:01:56.210> blend<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:56.960> much<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:57.560> make<00:01:57.740> sure

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
and only blend it this much so make sure

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.800 
and only blend it this much so make sure
you<00:01:57.979> still<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.549> swirls<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.090> there<00:01:59.270> now

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
you still have the swirls in there now

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.660 
you still have the swirls in there now
the<00:01:59.869> next<00:02:00.229> batch<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.649> going<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:01.009> be<00:02:01.130> more<00:02:01.399> white

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the next batch is going to be more white

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.170 
the next batch is going to be more white
than<00:02:02.390> purple<00:02:02.920> mix<00:02:03.920> them<00:02:04.100> up<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.000> one

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
than purple mix them up and this one

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.149 
than purple mix them up and this one
will<00:02:05.360> be<00:02:05.390> better<00:02:05.630> blended<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.740> next<00:02:07.009> batch

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
will be better blended the next batch

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.800 
will be better blended the next batch
you'll<00:02:07.399> have<00:02:07.549> more<00:02:07.820> purple<00:02:08.209> than<00:02:08.239> actual

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you'll have more purple than actual

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.059 
you'll have more purple than actual
white<00:02:08.989> mix<00:02:09.679> them<00:02:09.830> together<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> also<00:02:12.769> make

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
white mix them together and also make

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.190 
white mix them together and also make
sure<00:02:13.099> that<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.910> fully<00:02:14.209> blended<00:02:14.569> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
sure that this one is fully blended and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.540 
sure that this one is fully blended and
then<00:02:15.349> finally<00:02:15.709> you're<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.099> have<00:02:16.340> your

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
then finally you're going to have your

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.790 
then finally you're going to have your
full-fledged<00:02:17.150> purple<00:02:17.569> now<00:02:17.989> take<00:02:18.230> your<00:02:18.380> pearly

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
white out of the freezer and chop it up

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.570 
white out of the freezer and chop it up
with<00:02:20.989> your<00:02:21.260> cutter<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.160> get<00:02:25.310> little

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
with your cutter so that you get little

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.670 
with your cutter so that you get little
pieces<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.330> we'll<00:02:27.170> do<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.440> same<00:02:27.620> thing

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
pieces like this we'll do the same thing

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.960 
pieces like this we'll do the same thing
with<00:02:28.040> your<00:02:28.190> translucent<00:02:28.610> white<00:02:30.730> take<00:02:31.730> both

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
with your translucent white take both

with your translucent white take both
chopped<00:02:32.299> up<00:02:32.450> whites<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.900> put<00:02:33.170> them<00:02:33.319> one<00:02:33.500> on

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
chopped up whites and put them one on

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.640 
chopped up whites and put them one on
the<00:02:33.769> other<00:02:34.060> mix<00:02:35.060> them<00:02:35.239> up<00:02:35.330> now<00:02:36.200> squish<00:02:36.530> them

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the other mix them up now squish them

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820 
the other mix them up now squish them
together<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.160> make<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> ball<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.620> you're

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
together and make a ball so that you're

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.550 
together and make a ball so that you're
getting<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.130> mixture<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.640> looks<00:02:40.910> like<00:02:41.090> this

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
getting a mixture that looks like this

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.839 
getting a mixture that looks like this
now<00:02:42.560> you're<00:02:42.650> going<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.010> roll<00:02:43.220> your<00:02:43.489> mixture

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
now you're going to roll your mixture

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.000 
now you're going to roll your mixture
like<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.780> now<00:02:45.349> we're<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.769> start

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
like this and now we're going to start

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.039 
like this and now we're going to start
putting<00:02:46.280> layers<00:02:46.610> what<00:02:47.239> we<00:02:47.360> want<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.750> start

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
putting layers what we want to start

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.320 
putting layers what we want to start
with<00:02:48.230> are<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.739> two<00:02:48.950> lighter<00:02:49.310> tones<00:02:49.670> going<00:02:50.209> to

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
with are the two lighter tones going to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.089 
with are the two lighter tones going to
put<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:50.810> layer<00:02:51.049> at<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.319> time<00:02:51.410> you're<00:02:51.830> going<00:02:51.980> to

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
put one layer at a time you're going to

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.949 
put one layer at a time you're going to
start<00:02:52.310> with<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.549> lightest<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.390> then<00:02:53.840> the

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
start with the lightest one and then the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.660 
start with the lightest one and then the
darker<00:02:54.349> one<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.709> you're<00:02:55.010> going<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.519> this

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
darker one and you're going to do this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.240 
darker one and you're going to do this
at<00:02:55.910> least<00:02:55.970> four<00:02:56.630> times<00:02:56.840> make<00:02:57.799> sure<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.160> you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
at least four times make sure that you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.729 
at least four times make sure that you
flatten<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:58.819> as<00:02:59.000> flat<00:02:59.540> as<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.810> can<00:03:00.079> get<00:03:00.290> this

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
flatten this as flat as you can get this

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:15.760 
flatten this as flat as you can get this
thickness<00:03:01.100> should<00:03:01.430> do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.830 

now<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.460> we<00:03:16.550> have<00:03:16.700> four<00:03:17.000> layers<00:03:17.210> of<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
now that we have four layers of the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.750 
now that we have four layers of the
lighter<00:03:18.080> colors<00:03:18.530> let's<00:03:19.010> work<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
lighter colors let's work on to the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.120 
lighter colors let's work on to the
darker<00:03:20.090> ones<00:03:20.270> now<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.440> our<00:03:21.560> two<00:03:21.770> darker

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
darker ones now we have our two darker

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.800 
darker ones now we have our two darker
tones<00:03:22.370> you're<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.090> flatten<00:03:23.480> them<00:03:23.630> out

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
tones you're going to flatten them out

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.300 
tones you're going to flatten them out
the<00:03:24.230> same<00:03:24.440> way<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.650> did<00:03:24.800> with<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.100> lighter

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the same way you did with the lighter

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.130 
the same way you did with the lighter
ones<00:03:25.580> now<00:03:26.000> instead<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.540> starting<00:03:26.870> with<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
ones now instead of starting with the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.660 
ones now instead of starting with the
lighter<00:03:27.380> purple<00:03:27.710> we're<00:03:28.040> going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.310> start<00:03:28.550> with

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
lighter purple we're going to start with

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.240 
lighter purple we're going to start with
the<00:03:28.790> darker<00:03:29.240> one<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.840> layer<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:33.800> this<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:34.100> what

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
the darker one to layer so this is what

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.950 
the darker one to layer so this is what
we<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:34.760> far<00:03:34.790> now<00:03:35.420> what<00:03:35.570> we're<00:03:35.720> going<00:03:35.900> to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
we have so far now what we're going to

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.140 
we have so far now what we're going to
do<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.290> build<00:03:36.470> thicker<00:03:36.860> layers<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.790> don't

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
do is build thicker layers so don't

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.170 
do is build thicker layers so don't
flatten<00:03:38.510> your<00:03:38.720> pieces<00:03:38.930> as<00:03:39.290> thin<00:03:39.800> as<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:40.520> so

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
flatten your pieces as thin as of now so

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.970 
flatten your pieces as thin as of now so
this<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.660> thinness<00:03:41.870> we<00:03:42.200> were<00:03:42.350> using<00:03:42.530> just

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
this is the thinness we were using just

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.350

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
to put one of the pieces through so that

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.920 
to put one of the pieces through so that
it's<00:04:48.860> super<00:04:49.250> thin<00:04:49.430> when<00:04:50.270> we<00:04:50.390> pushed<00:04:50.630> with<00:04:50.810> our
