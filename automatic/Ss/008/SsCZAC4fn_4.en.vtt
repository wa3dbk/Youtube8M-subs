00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
point scorer in these playoffs so that

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.590 
point scorer in these playoffs so that
has<00:02:40.200> been<00:02:40.470> something<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.820> think<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.270> San

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
has been something that I think the San

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.270 
has been something that I think the San
Antonio<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:43.110> hold<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> hat<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:44.160> I'm<00:02:44.250> not

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
Antonio can hold a hat on but I'm not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.270 
Antonio can hold a hat on but I'm not
sure<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:45.750> they're<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.770> able<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.010> keep

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
sure if they're going to be able to keep

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.390 
sure if they're going to be able to keep
the<00:02:47.490> two<00:02:47.640> guys<00:02:47.820> out<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.420> lane<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:49.400> they

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the two guys out of the lane that they

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.090 
the two guys out of the lane that they
need<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.640> which<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.330> Dwayne<00:02:51.840> Wade<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.410> LeBron

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
need to which is Dwayne Wade and LeBron

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.130 
need to which is Dwayne Wade and LeBron
James<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.060> Dwyane<00:02:54.840> Wade's

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
James and I think Dwyane Wade's

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.070 
James and I think Dwyane Wade's
increased<00:02:55.980> play<00:02:56.280> has<00:02:56.520> moved<00:02:56.970> my<00:02:57.270> needle<00:02:57.810> over

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
increased play has moved my needle over

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.500 
increased play has moved my needle over
towards<00:02:58.620> Miami<00:02:59.010> because<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> what<00:03:00.300> he's<00:03:00.480> been

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
towards Miami because of what he's been

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.230 
towards Miami because of what he's been
doing<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> last<00:03:01.500> two<00:03:01.950> rounds<00:03:02.120> during<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
doing in the last two rounds during the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.730 
doing in the last two rounds during the
regular<00:03:03.480> season<00:03:03.660> he<00:03:03.930> wasn't<00:03:04.320> playing<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.590> way

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
regular season he wasn't playing the way

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.470 
regular season he wasn't playing the way
he<00:03:04.890> planned<00:03:05.100> at<00:03:05.550> least<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> efficiency

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
he planned at least with the efficiency

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.830 
he planned at least with the efficiency
that<00:03:06.780> he's<00:03:07.380> playing<00:03:07.590> now
