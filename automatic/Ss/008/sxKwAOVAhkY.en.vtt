is<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.070> say<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.939> 49ers<00:01:52.450> are<00:01:52.570> used<00:01:52.780> to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
is to say that the 49ers are used to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.719 
is to say that the 49ers are used to
playing<00:01:53.140> tight<00:01:53.799> games<00:01:54.130> they're<00:01:54.460> used<00:01:54.640> to

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
playing tight games they're used to

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.840 
playing tight games they're used to
playing<00:01:55.470> big<00:01:56.470> games<00:01:56.770> they've<00:01:57.490> been<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.790> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
playing big games they've been in the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.520 
playing big games they've been in the
playoffs<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.450> last<00:01:58.479> three<00:01:59.020> years<00:01:59.200> they've

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
playoffs the last three years they've

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.710 
playoffs the last three years they've
gone<00:01:59.650> deep<00:02:00.009> into<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.400> playoffs<00:02:00.490> each<00:02:01.450> of

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
gone deep into the playoffs each of

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.840 
gone deep into the playoffs each of
those<00:02:01.840> times<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.979> think<00:02:03.430> that's<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.670> big

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
those times and I think that's a big

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.670 
those times and I think that's a big
difference<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.420> this<00:02:04.509> game<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.869> 49ers<00:02:05.409> are

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
difference in this game the 49ers are

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.330 
difference in this game the 49ers are
accustomed<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:07.270> playing<00:02:07.420> high<00:02:07.960> pressure

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
accustomed to playing high pressure

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.919 
accustomed to playing high pressure
playoff<00:02:09.340> games<00:02:09.640> whereas<00:02:10.090> maybe<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.540> Panthers

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
playoff games whereas maybe the Panthers

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.960 
playoff games whereas maybe the Panthers
aren't<00:02:11.320> at<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.680> point<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.459> second<00:02:12.850> reason

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
aren't at this point the second reason

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
aren't at this point the second reason
would<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:14.079> Cam<00:02:14.290> Newton<00:02:14.680> has<00:02:14.769> been<00:02:14.920> doing

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
would be what Cam Newton has been doing

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.240 
would be what Cam Newton has been doing
he's<00:02:16.180> obviously<00:02:16.870> has<00:02:17.110> an<00:02:17.230> escape<00:02:17.410> ability<00:02:17.950> so

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
he's obviously has an escape ability so

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.940 
he's obviously has an escape ability so
does<00:02:18.430> Colin<00:02:18.730> Kaepernick<00:02:19.209> but<00:02:19.950> Newton's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
does Colin Kaepernick but Newton's

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.100 
does Colin Kaepernick but Newton's
ability<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.579> last<00:02:21.790> six<00:02:22.120> seven<00:02:22.660> games<00:02:22.900> to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
ability in the last six seven games to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.610 
ability in the last six seven games to
extend<00:02:23.590> plays<00:02:23.890> too<00:02:24.670> not<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.480> give<00:02:26.049> up<00:02:26.230> give

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
extend plays too not just give up give

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.309 
extend plays too not just give up give
up<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.860> sack<00:02:27.270> has<00:02:28.270> made<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.810> Panthers<00:02:29.200> a

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
up a sack has made the Panthers a

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.710 
up a sack has made the Panthers a
dramatically<00:02:30.069> better<00:02:30.370> team<00:02:30.760> they're<00:02:31.629> going

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
dramatically better team they're going

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.790 
dramatically better team they're going
to<00:02:31.810> need<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.200> because

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
to need that because

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.980 
to need that because
obviously<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.610> 49ers<00:02:34.390> are<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.780> about

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
obviously the the 49ers are just about

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.080 
obviously the the 49ers are just about
as<00:02:35.170> good<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.410> defense<00:02:35.770> as<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.520> Panthers<00:02:36.910> are

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
as good at defense as the Panthers are

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.600 
as good at defense as the Panthers are
49ers<00:02:37.990> have<00:02:38.230> been<00:02:38.500> very<00:02:39.010> good<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.400> road

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
49ers have been very good on the road

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.810 
49ers have been very good on the road
there's<00:02:40.510> only<00:02:40.960> been<00:02:41.170> one<00:02:41.230> East<00:02:42.220> Coast<00:02:42.580> game

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
there's only been one East Coast game

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.910 
there's only been one East Coast game
that<00:02:43.030> they've<00:02:43.180> lost<00:02:43.570> under<00:02:44.170> Jim<00:02:44.500> Harbaugh

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
that they've lost under Jim Harbaugh

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.580 
that they've lost under Jim Harbaugh
otherwise<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.060> 49ers<00:02:46.570> are<00:02:46.690> undefeated<00:02:47.410> on

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
otherwise the 49ers are undefeated on

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.360 
otherwise the 49ers are undefeated on
the<00:02:47.730> east<00:02:48.730> coast<00:02:48.850> from<00:02:49.300> 2011<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.710> think<00:02:51.100> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
the east coast from 2011 on I think the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.910 
the east coast from 2011 on I think the
Panthers<00:02:52.330> will<00:02:52.480> have<00:02:52.660> some<00:02:52.960> home-field

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
Panthers will have some home-field

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.820 
Panthers will have some home-field
advantages<00:02:54.580> for<00:02:54.880> sure<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.470> early

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
advantages for sure but the the early

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.130 
advantages for sure but the the early
start<00:02:57.160> might<00:02:57.550> not<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.910> as<00:02:58.060> big<00:02:58.300> as<00:02:58.480> an

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
start might not be as big as an

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.740 
start might not be as big as an
advantage<00:02:59.710> as<00:02:59.950> they<00:03:00.460> would<00:03:00.610> hope<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.510> third

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
advantage as they would hope the third

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.690 
advantage as they would hope the third
one<00:03:01.990> would<00:03:02.140> be<00:03:02.200> what<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.740> 49ers<00:03:02.980> have<00:03:03.460> had<00:03:03.610> to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
one would be what the 49ers have had to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.850 
one would be what the 49ers have had to
go<00:03:03.850> through<00:03:03.880> lately<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:05.020> get<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.590> point

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
go through lately to get to this point

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.950 
go through lately to get to this point
while<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.910> Panthers<00:03:07.270> were<00:03:07.420> at<00:03:07.510> home<00:03:07.690> getting

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
while the Panthers were at home getting

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.470 
while the Panthers were at home getting
healthy<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:09.220> 49ers<00:03:09.610> not<00:03:10.030> only<00:03:10.210> had<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> very

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
healthy the 49ers not only had a very

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.780 
healthy the 49ers not only had a very
physical<00:03:10.900> game<00:03:11.170> but<00:03:11.650> he<00:03:11.740> had<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.070> game<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.460> very

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
physical game but he had a game in very

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.820 
physical game but he had a game in very
brutal<00:03:13.240> conditions<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:14.110> there<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.290> probably

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
brutal conditions but there is probably

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.070 
brutal conditions but there is probably
going<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.040> be<00:03:15.160> some<00:03:15.400> residual<00:03:15.970> effect<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.630> that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
going to be some residual effect in that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.840 
going to be some residual effect in that
game<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.650> now<00:03:18.310> they're<00:03:18.490> going<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.760> to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
game and now they're going to have to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.130 
game and now they're going to have to
