00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
looking at here so you are exactly on
this<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> an<00:00:37.800> innovative<00:00:38.190> design

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this but that it is an innovative design

this but that it is an innovative design
what<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.450> can't<00:00:39.809> coming<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
what we can't coming up with is the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.459 
what we can't coming up with is the

know<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.030> introduced<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
know that we just introduced what you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
know that we just introduced what you
what's<00:00:55.860> interesting<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.520> design<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
what's interesting about that design is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.950 
what's interesting about that design is
that<00:00:57.440> we<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.980> gpgpu<00:00:59.820> modules<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.660> are

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that we have two gpgpu modules that are

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.390 
that we have two gpgpu modules that are
called<00:01:01.199> nvidia<00:01:01.829> tesla<00:01:02.489> x<00:01:02.940> 2070<00:01:03.899> aha<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:05.100> are

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
called nvidia tesla x 2070 aha these are

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850 
called nvidia tesla x 2070 aha these are
late<00:01:06.030> market<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.409> first<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
late market on then we are first to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
late market on then we are first to
market<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.510> with<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.689> technology<00:01:10.020> being

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
market with with this technology being

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.210 
market with with this technology being
introduced<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.670> put<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.350> there

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
introduced you put one here on one there

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
introduced you put one here on one there
and<00:01:15.030> basically<00:01:15.530> what<00:01:16.530> happens<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.689> we<00:01:18.689> do

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and basically what happens is that we do

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.460 
and basically what happens is that we do
not<00:01:18.990> compromise<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.470> throughput

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
not compromise on the on the throughput

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
not compromise on the on the throughput
it's<00:01:23.430> very<00:01:23.640> dense<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.270> 16<00:01:24.750> plays<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's very dense you have 16 plays that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's very dense you have 16 plays that
place<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.159> shell<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> point<00:01:27.509> though

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
place in a shell that's the point though

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
place in a shell that's the point though
is<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.930> blade<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.890> not<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
is that this is the blade there's not a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
is that this is the blade there's not a
carrier<00:01:32.850> underneath<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> there's<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
carrier underneath that there's not a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230 
carrier underneath that there's not a
thick<00:01:34.380> metal<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.369> gives<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> rigidity

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
thick metal that gives it the rigidity

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
thick metal that gives it the rigidity
you're<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> rigidity<00:01:37.409> from

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you're getting the rigidity from

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.690 
you're getting the rigidity from
focusing<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.869> that's<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> heatsink

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
focusing in on this that's the heatsink

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.810 
focusing in on this that's the heatsink
that<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.540> exactly<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.290> same<00:01:43.560> size<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that is exactly the same size and it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
that is exactly the same size and it
attached<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> heatsink<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.320> your

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
attached the heatsink and that's your

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.789 
attached the heatsink and that's your
rail<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.990> rigidity<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
rail and it's your your rigidity for the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
rail and it's your your rigidity for the

each blade in and out of this chassis

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.410 
each blade in and out of this chassis
and<00:01:58.229> yes<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.009> very<00:01:59.250> complex<00:01:59.729> design<00:02:00.149> we're

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and yes it's a very complex design we're

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
and yes it's a very complex design we're
actually<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.409> turns<00:02:01.649> your<00:02:01.799> age<00:02:02.009> /

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
actually if I just turns your age /

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.000 
actually if I just turns your age /
actually

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
actually

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.730 
actually
spend<00:02:03.510> quite<00:02:04.510> some<00:02:04.540> time<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.140> do<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.380> thermal

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
spend quite some time to do the thermal

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.090 
spend quite some time to do the thermal
simulations<00:02:06.490> or<00:02:06.760> in<00:02:07.630> order<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:07.990> achieve<00:02:08.440> best

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
simulations or in order to achieve best

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.900 
simulations or in order to achieve best
you<00:02:09.820> know<00:02:10.000> wait<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.810> effectiveness<00:02:11.910> ratio

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you know wait to effectiveness ratio

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.910 
you know wait to effectiveness ratio
because<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.720> thing<00:02:14.020> should<00:02:14.320> not<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.710> very

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
because this thing should not be very

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.800 
because this thing should not be very
heavy<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> keep<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.500> system<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.490> down

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
heavy just to keep the system way down

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.170 
heavy just to keep the system way down
okay<00:02:19.810> basically<00:02:20.740> what<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.190> came<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.490> with<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
okay basically what we came up with is a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.250 
okay basically what we came up with is a
16<00:02:22.750> place<00:02:22.960> in<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> seven<00:02:23.590> years<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:25.030> get<00:02:25.260> your

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
16 place in the seven years you get your

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.530 
16 place in the seven years you get your
32<00:02:26.740> GPU<00:02:27.220> cars<00:02:27.490> first<00:02:27.880> seven<00:02:28.210> you<00:02:28.300> which<00:02:28.510> is

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
32 GPU cars first seven you which is

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.300 
32 GPU cars first seven you which is
unheard<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.320> that's<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.800> pretty<00:02:29.980> big<00:02:30.130> number

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
unheard of that's a pretty big number

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.670 
unheard of that's a pretty big number
and<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:31.240> did<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.480> compromise<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:31.990> design<00:02:32.500> so

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and we did not compromise on design so

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.370 
and we did not compromise on design so
what<00:02:32.860> we<00:02:33.010> have<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.820> separate<00:02:34.540> northbridge

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
what we have is a separate northbridge

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.410 
what we have is a separate northbridge
with<00:02:35.650> PCI<00:02:35.980> Express<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.850> explain

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
with PCI Express so this explain

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.310 
with PCI Express so this explain
generation<00:02:38.260> 2<00:02:38.290> per<00:02:38.800> GPU<00:02:39.330> who<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.750> only<00:02:40.780> this

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
generation 2 per GPU who not only this

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.870 
generation 2 per GPU who not only this
but<00:02:41.380> we<00:02:41.740> also<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.190> single<00:02:42.640> port

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
but we also have a single port

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.150 
but we also have a single port
connectives<00:02:43.510> infiniband<00:02:44.200> what<00:02:44.710> qgr

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
connectives infiniband what qgr

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.870

infiniband<00:02:45.850> port<00:02:46.090> per<00:02:46.570> GPU<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
infiniband port per GPU so it's a

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
c10 you could have a bigger system a

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.520 
c10 you could have a bigger system a
little<00:05:57.300> something<00:05:58.300> it's<00:05:58.419> only<00:05:58.690> seven<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.319> you
