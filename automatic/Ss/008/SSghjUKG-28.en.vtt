00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
case sir has been a church on the site

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
case sir has been a church on the site
there<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.610> her<00:00:56.730> actually<00:00:57.210> since<00:00:57.510> he<00:00:58.020> was

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

there for her actually since he was
killed<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.460> there<00:01:00.149> must<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.420> been

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
killed there so there must have been

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.349 
killed there so there must have been
something<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.940> conquest<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
something there before the conquest and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.479 
something there before the conquest and
there<00:01:04.199> was<00:01:04.320> certainly<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.739> church<00:01:05.010> built<00:01:05.280> there

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
there was certainly a church built there

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.450 
there was certainly a church built there
quite<00:01:06.390> soon<00:01:06.600> afterwards<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
quite soon afterwards and this is the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.810 
quite soon afterwards and this is the
third<00:01:08.670> church<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.020> dominates<00:01:10.470> your

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820

that's<00:01:14.549> been<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> side<00:01:15.150> over<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> last

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that's been on the side over the last

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's been on the side over the last
year<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.470> you've<00:01:17.220> had<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
year or so you've had a lot of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.690 
year or so you've had a lot of
restoration<00:01:18.570> work<00:01:18.750> done<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:20.250> partly

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
restoration work done to the well partly

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.450 
restoration work done to the well partly
because<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:21.210> were<00:01:21.360> thinking<00:01:21.720> about<00:01:22.460> getting

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
because we were thinking about getting

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
because we were thinking about getting
ready<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> Olympics<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.960> partly

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
ready for the Olympics and partly

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.469 
ready for the Olympics and partly
because<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.729> necessary<00:01:27.240> work

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
because there was very necessary work

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.260 
because there was very necessary work
that<00:01:27.689> needed<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.020> done<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.590> tower<00:01:29.270> we

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that needed to be done on the tower we

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.960 
that needed to be done on the tower we
got<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> legacy<00:01:31.020> from<00:01:31.439> somebody<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.820> were

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
got a legacy from somebody so we were

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.230 
got a legacy from somebody so we were
able<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.390> restore<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.200> end<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> church

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
able to restore this end of the church

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.850 
able to restore this end of the church
but<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:37.020> something<00:01:37.470> similar

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
but now we want to do something similar

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.010 
but now we want to do something similar
to<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.460> other<00:01:38.700> end<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> church<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
