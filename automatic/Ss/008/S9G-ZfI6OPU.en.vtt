00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
someday it's got a definite date so by

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.879 
someday it's got a definite date so by
january<00:03:38.849> first<00:03:39.209> 2014<00:03:40.199> and<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.609> goal<00:03:41.790> specific

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
january first 2014 and the goal specific

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.039 
january first 2014 and the goal specific
so<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.549> goal<00:03:44.729> is<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:45.239> generates<00:03:45.720> at<00:03:45.870> least

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
so the goal is that generates at least

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.930 
so the goal is that generates at least
three<00:03:46.530> hundred<00:03:46.859> dollars<00:03:47.129> per<00:03:47.519> month<00:03:47.549> on

three hundred dollars per month on

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.390 
three hundred dollars per month on

average and endures for a minimum of
five<00:03:50.699> years<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.290> passive<00:03:52.889> income

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
five years so this is a passive income

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.420 
five years so this is a passive income
goal<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:54.150> say<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.389> have<00:03:54.629> a<00:03:54.659> goal<00:03:54.870> for<00:03:54.989> yourself
