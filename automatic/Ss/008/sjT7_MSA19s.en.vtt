00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.510 

back<00:00:04.330> in<00:00:04.420> the<00:00:04.509> day<00:00:04.660> we<00:00:04.810> used<00:00:04.840> to<00:00:05.050> like<00:00:05.260> to<00:00:05.520> get

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
back in the day we used to like to get

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.660 
back in the day we used to like to get
some<00:00:06.729> reverse<00:00:07.059> sounds<00:00:07.569> so<00:00:07.660> we'd<00:00:07.809> have<00:00:07.840> like<00:00:08.080> a

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
some reverse sounds so we'd have like a

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.610 
some reverse sounds so we'd have like a
boom<00:00:09.670> well<00:00:10.420> in<00:00:10.809> order<00:00:11.049> to<00:00:11.139> do<00:00:11.290> that<00:00:11.410> with<00:00:11.589> a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
boom well in order to do that with a

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.430 
boom well in order to do that with a
with<00:00:11.950> tape<00:00:12.190> you'd<00:00:12.820> write<00:00:13.030> track<00:00:13.419> 1<00:00:13.690> through<00:00:13.929> 24

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
with tape you'd write track 1 through 24

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.140 
with tape you'd write track 1 through 24
on<00:00:14.530> a<00:00:14.559> sheet<00:00:14.799> of<00:00:14.919> paper<00:00:15.099> and<00:00:15.429> then<00:00:15.730> right<00:00:15.940> next

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
on a sheet of paper and then right next

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.110 
on a sheet of paper and then right next
to<00:00:16.360> those<00:00:16.539> numbers<00:00:17.050> you<00:00:17.080> start<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:18.400> track<00:00:18.610> 24

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
to those numbers you start with track 24

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.730 
to those numbers you start with track 24
and<00:00:19.240> go<00:00:19.330> down<00:00:19.510> to<00:00:19.660> 1<00:00:19.870> and<00:00:20.170> then<00:00:20.320> so<00:00:20.560> you'd<00:00:20.710> have

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
and go down to 1 and then so you'd have

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.150 
and go down to 1 and then so you'd have
to<00:00:20.950> coordinate<00:00:21.220> so<00:00:22.150> track<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:23.590> you<00:00:23.800> if<00:00:24.040> the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
to coordinate so track if you if the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160 
to coordinate so track if you if the
sound<00:00:24.400> you<00:00:24.520> under<00:00:24.790> reverse<00:00:25.180> was<00:00:25.540> recorded<00:00:26.050> on

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
sound you under reverse was recorded on

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.600 
sound you under reverse was recorded on
track<00:00:28.020> 2<00:00:29.020> when<00:00:29.620> you<00:00:29.710> flip<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:29.950> tape<00:00:30.220> over<00:00:30.430> it

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
track 2 when you flip the tape over it

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.299 
track 2 when you flip the tape over it
would<00:00:30.880> now<00:00:31.000> be<00:00:31.060> track<00:00:31.450> 23<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.439> then<00:00:33.040> you<00:00:33.160> had

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
would now be track 23 and then you had

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.549 
would now be track 23 and then you had
to<00:00:33.399> use<00:00:33.579> that<00:00:33.760> same<00:00:34.059> chart<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.690> know<00:00:34.870> when

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
to use that same chart to know when

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.700 
to use that same chart to know when
where<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.160> record<00:00:36.579> what<00:00:36.910> you've<00:00:37.059> just<00:00:37.089> done<00:00:37.710> so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
where to record what you've just done so

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.040 
where to record what you've just done so
in<00:00:39.070> Pro<00:00:39.640> Tools<00:00:39.670> it's<00:00:40.179> a<00:00:40.239> little<00:00:40.510> bit<00:00:40.629> different

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
in Pro Tools it's a little bit different

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.329 
in Pro Tools it's a little bit different
I<00:00:41.109> haven't<00:00:41.320> done<00:00:41.409> this<00:00:41.530> in<00:00:41.589> a<00:00:41.739> while<00:00:41.769> so<00:00:42.100> bear

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
I haven't done this in a while so bear

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.549 
I haven't done this in a while so bear
with<00:00:42.370> me<00:00:42.550> here's<00:00:43.329> my<00:00:43.570> original<00:00:43.809> sound<00:00:44.320> like

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
with me here's my original sound like

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.020 
with me here's my original sound like
here's<00:00:44.769> a<00:00:44.829> here's<00:00:45.159> a<00:00:45.219> here's<00:00:45.609> a<00:00:45.670> snare<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
here's a here's a here's a snare so

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.110 
here's a here's a here's a snare so
let's<00:00:49.269> say<00:00:49.449> we<00:00:49.629> want<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:49.929> we<00:00:50.350> want<00:00:50.379> a<00:00:51.120> reverse

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
let's say we want to we want a reverse

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.349 
let's say we want to we want a reverse
version<00:00:52.539> of<00:00:52.839> that<00:00:53.079> well<00:00:53.979> what<00:00:54.609> I<00:00:54.640> do<00:00:54.789> there's

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
version of that well what I do there's

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.849 
version of that well what I do there's
probably<00:00:55.629> some<00:00:55.780> better<00:00:55.960> ways<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.440> fact<00:00:56.559> coal

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
probably some better ways in fact coal

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.229 
probably some better ways in fact coal
has<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.129> better<00:00:57.429> way<00:00:57.640> but<00:00:57.699> we're<00:00:57.940> going<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.120> try

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
has a better way but we're going to try

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.790 
has a better way but we're going to try
my<00:00:58.390> way<00:00:58.569> today<00:00:58.719> because<00:00:59.079> it's<00:00:59.260> it's<00:00:59.589> more

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
my way today because it's it's more

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.299 
my way today because it's it's more
complex<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.609> convoluted<00:01:00.909> than<00:01:01.359> just<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:02.309> don't

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
complex and convoluted than just I don't

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.420 
complex and convoluted than just I don't
know<00:01:03.519> why<00:01:03.699> I<00:01:03.729> like<00:01:04.330> it<00:01:04.540> so<00:01:05.140> listen<00:01:05.890> we're<00:01:06.280> going

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
know why I like it so listen we're going

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.830 
know why I like it so listen we're going
to<00:01:06.490> take<00:01:06.610> this<00:01:06.759> little<00:01:07.000> piece<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.420> sound

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
to take this little piece of the sound

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.280 
to take this little piece of the sound
we're<00:01:08.799> gonna<00:01:08.979> we're<00:01:09.549> gonna<00:01:09.670> make<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.509> copy<00:01:10.899> and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
we're gonna we're gonna make a copy and

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.690 
we're gonna we're gonna make a copy and
then<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.040> took<00:01:12.219> and<00:01:13.259> reverse<00:01:14.259> that<00:01:14.560> copy<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.490> I

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
then I took and reverse that copy so I

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.539 
then I took and reverse that copy so I
just<00:01:16.320> highlighted<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.469> rendered<00:01:18.310> and

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
just highlighted it rendered and

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.359 
just highlighted it rendered and
reversed<00:01:19.329> it<00:01:19.509> not<00:01:19.689> your<00:01:20.170> every<00:01:20.530> da<00:01:20.740> W<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.340> a

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
reversed it not your every da W is a

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.700 
reversed it not your every da W is a
little<00:01:21.700> bit<00:01:21.820> different<00:01:22.270> now<00:01:22.450> while<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.229> had<00:01:23.590> it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
little bit different now while I had it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.060 
little bit different now while I had it
reversed<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:26.610> recorded<00:01:28.619> effects<00:01:29.619> on<00:01:29.890> this

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
reversed I recorded effects on this

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.670 
reversed I recorded effects on this
little<00:01:30.280> bad<00:01:30.460> boy<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.000> check<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.390> out<00:01:31.680> now

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
little bad boy so check this out now

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.310 
little bad boy so check this out now
that<00:01:33.490> I've<00:01:33.549> got<00:01:33.729> reversed<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.390> put<00:01:34.659> I<00:01:34.810> put<00:01:35.079> a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
that I've got reversed I put I put a

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.920 
that I've got reversed I put I put a
little<00:01:35.740> echo<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:37.030> little<00:01:37.329> reverb<00:01:37.539> on

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
little echo on it and a little reverb on

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.109 
little echo on it and a little reverb on
it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.230 

okay<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.840> now<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.049> recorded<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.090> onto<00:01:46.090> this

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
okay so now I recorded that onto this

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.169 
okay so now I recorded that onto this
track<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.170> then<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.310> then<00:01:48.429> I<00:01:48.460> reversed<00:01:48.969> it

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
track and then and then I reversed it

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.620 
track and then and then I reversed it
again<00:01:49.600> back<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.710> then<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.280> put<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.759> in<00:01:51.880> time<00:01:52.210> so

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
again back and then I put it in time so

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.149 
again back and then I put it in time so
now<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:53.049> going<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.289> coordinate<00:01:53.829> with<00:01:53.979> this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
now it's going to coordinate with this

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.380 
now it's going to coordinate with this
track<00:01:54.490> here<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:56.429> so<00:01:57.429> let's<00:01:57.729> see<00:01:57.850> what<00:01:58.240> we've

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
track here so so let's see what we've

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:07.949 
track here so so let's see what we've
got<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:06.310> can<00:02:06.340> do<00:02:06.640> quicker<00:02:07.119> delays<00:02:07.539> and

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
got and you can do quicker delays and

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.600 
got and you can do quicker delays and
tighter<00:02:08.229> patterns<00:02:08.769> you<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.009> do<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.280> guitar

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
tighter patterns you can do it on guitar

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.710 
tighter patterns you can do it on guitar
part<00:02:09.910> snare<00:02:10.450> parts<00:02:10.899> vocal<00:02:11.410> parts<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.540> you've

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
part snare parts vocal parts and you've

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.930 
part snare parts vocal parts and you've
got<00:02:13.900> you've<00:02:14.140> got<00:02:14.170> total<00:02:14.650> control<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.400> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
got you've got total control so the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.600 
got you've got total control so the
amount<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.900> amount<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.290> delays<00:02:18.160> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
amount of the amount of delays and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.190 
amount of the amount of delays and
reverb<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.269> have<00:02:19.390> going<00:02:19.720> into<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
reverb that you have going into the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.190 
reverb that you have going into the
original<00:02:20.440> sound<00:02:21.040> which<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.610> here<00:02:21.640> is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
original sound which is up here is

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.630 
original sound which is up here is
determine<00:02:23.200> about<00:02:23.380> everything<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.130> do<00:02:24.310> here

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
determine about everything you do here

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.330 
determine about everything you do here
so<00:02:24.819> I've<00:02:24.970> got<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.209> lot<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.870> feedback<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.709> then

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
so I've got a lot of feedback and then

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.250 
so I've got a lot of feedback and then
and<00:02:27.640> then<00:02:28.090> I've<00:02:28.420> got<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.750> little<00:02:32.049> bit<00:02:32.140> of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
and then I've got about a little bit of

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.069 
and then I've got about a little bit of
reverb<00:02:32.380> now<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.040> feedback<00:02:33.370> up<00:02:33.790> here<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.900> could

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
reverb now the feedback up here we could

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.809 
reverb now the feedback up here we could
have<00:02:38.170> done<00:02:38.380> what<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> we<00:02:42.579> could<00:02:42.700> have

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
have done what is that so we could have

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.640 
have done what is that so we could have
done<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.970> quarter<00:02:43.390> note<00:02:43.569> we<00:02:43.840> could<00:02:43.989> done<00:02:44.200> so

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
done a quarter note we could done so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.860 
done a quarter note we could done so
quarter<00:02:44.980> notes<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.600> would<00:02:46.780> be

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
quarter notes is that that that would be

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.530 
quarter notes is that that that would be
that<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.889> but<00:02:48.609> you<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:48.880> do<00:02:48.970> both<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.450> then

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
that that but you can do both and then

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.940 
that that but you can do both and then
blend<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:49.989> record<00:02:50.380> two<00:02:50.560> different<00:02:50.889> ones

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
blend them record two different ones

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.039 
blend them record two different ones
that<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.530> know<00:02:53.650> like<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:54.150> anyway<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
that you know like that anyway it's the

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.069 
that you know like that anyway it's the
fact<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.730> can<00:02:57.880> do<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.239> easily<00:02:58.269> now<00:02:58.870> with

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
fact that you can do so easily now with

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.900 
fact that you can do so easily now with
a<00:02:59.109> lot<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.380> plugins<00:02:59.769> from<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.459> say<00:03:00.700> maybe

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
a lot of plugins from like say maybe

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.170 
a lot of plugins from like say maybe
some<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.989> bt<00:03:02.380> plug-ins<00:03:02.889> for<00:03:02.980> isotope<00:03:03.639> you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
some of the bt plug-ins for isotope you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.490 
some of the bt plug-ins for isotope you
can<00:03:04.269> do<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.389> lot<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.630> things<00:03:04.810> out<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.019> manic<00:03:05.380> but

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
can do a lot of things out of manic but

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.200 
can do a lot of things out of manic but
just<00:03:06.370> one<00:03:06.519> way<00:03:07.200> adios
