00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
now that matches our people with the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.400 
now that matches our people with the
curry<00:00:54.489> like<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.940> said<00:01:01.210> one<00:01:01.359> career<00:01:01.690> day<00:01:01.929> for<00:01:02.199> two

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
curry like I said one career day for two

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.430 
curry like I said one career day for two
years<00:01:02.440> would<00:01:02.829> time<00:01:03.010> up<00:01:03.160> for<00:01:03.340> holidays<00:01:04.289> are<00:01:05.289> you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
years would time up for holidays are you

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.070 
years would time up for holidays are you
right<00:01:05.649> on<00:01:06.030> 660<00:01:07.030> well<00:01:07.300> I<00:01:07.360> wanted<00:01:07.660> to<00:01:07.720> do<00:01:07.840> six

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
right on 660 well I wanted to do six

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.270 
right on 660 well I wanted to do six
more<00:01:08.289> but<00:01:08.590> then<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:08.800> thought<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.130> would<00:01:09.250> be

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
more but then we thought that would be

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.060 
more but then we thought that would be
too<00:01:09.490> wicked<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.420> we<00:01:10.660> ended<00:01:10.990> up<00:01:11.110> starting

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
too wicked and so we ended up starting

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.550 
too wicked and so we ended up starting
1001<00:01:13.000> but<00:01:13.209> the<00:01:13.300> book<00:01:13.479> what<00:01:13.840> I've<00:01:13.959> gotten<00:01:14.349> to<00:01:14.440> be

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
1001 but the book what I've gotten to be

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.770 
1001 but the book what I've gotten to be
too<00:01:14.590> big<00:01:15.009> because<00:01:15.819> when<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.179> think<00:01:16.420> about<00:01:16.509> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
too big because when you think about the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.389 
too big because when you think about the
concept<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.319> Curry's<00:01:17.740> from<00:01:18.039> an<00:01:18.099> Indian

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
standpoint it really is everything to do

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.440 
standpoint it really is everything to do
with<00:01:20.800> sauces<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.789> nothing<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.209> do<00:01:22.330> with

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
with sauces and nothing to do with

nothing<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.890> do<00:04:31.040> with<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.400> even<00:04:31.670> though<00:04:31.760> they

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
nothing to do with it even though they

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.250 
nothing to do with it even though they
are<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.060> back<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.510> layering<00:04:32.810> hers

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
are the back of layering hers

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.900 
are the back of layering hers
it's<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.830> layering<00:04:34.100> it's<00:04:34.430> if<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:34.670> doesn't

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
it's the layering it's if it doesn't

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.550 
it's the layering it's if it doesn't
have<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> sauce<00:04:35.330> it's<00:04:35.660> not<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> curry<00:04:36.110> all<00:04:36.350> right
