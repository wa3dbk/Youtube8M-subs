00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.290
 Dealers pointed to the border, we cross the right direction 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 and so healthy way that I'm so good at swimming the moon 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.869
 please pay attention to the dizziness on the fit 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.210
 she must be able to press the face while pressing 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.490
 without a good opportunity 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.320
 the technique is not a sad occasion 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.439
 therefore it is advisable at the beginning 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.329
 the arms and legs movements individually trains 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.060
 for example, with a swimming board 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.919
 it is better to swim short distances properly 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.810
 as long stretches 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.200
 the situation in the water must be calm 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.880
 Avoid commuting 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.290
 The arms dive in the train phase always in service and right turn 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.480
 Current and shoulder width 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.930
 and with closed window in the project 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.690
 then they hear under water 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.160
 one hand each with 90 degrees bent elbows past the body 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 to the middle of the thigh 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.100
 your own hand dips 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.690
 leaves the other hand 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.390
 Thigh just that thing 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.030
 and becomes above the water surface with bent elbows on the body of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.960
 Bahrain pulled forward 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.280
 and then put back there again 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.799
 meanwhile, the elbow is always the highest point in motion 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.530
 that they use this time tractor to water 1 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.930
 then both were important 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.130
 shouted loud 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 every third turn 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.580
 The IPA musculature remains relaxed so far have returned to the water 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.760
 dips 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 and to recapture with the other hand 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 Meanwhile, the fine beats just below the water surface 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.310
 For a role swim with a hefty hit on the accounts 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980
 the bank 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.850
 makes a difference 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 Now turn your body after knocking off the wall 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.320
 walk with the feet back to the root position 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 Avoid cramping during kicking 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.990
 by preheating and stretching 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.260
 as well as enough water and magnesium in the diet
