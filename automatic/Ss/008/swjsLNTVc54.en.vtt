00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
going to be because tension strings out

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
going to be because tension strings out

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
don't have the patience to do the whole

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.510 
don't have the patience to do the whole
to<00:01:51.630> night<00:01:51.959> thing<00:01:52.319> you<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.130> want<00:01:53.249> to<00:01:53.340> twist

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to night thing you don't want to twist

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.639 
to night thing you don't want to twist
your<00:01:53.700> hair<00:01:53.969> two<00:01:54.149> nights<00:01:54.389> in<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.630> row<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:55.469> do<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
your hair two nights in a row just do a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.679 
your hair two nights in a row just do a
braid<00:01:55.950> out<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.549> braid<00:01:56.909> outs<00:01:57.149> give<00:01:57.569> you

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
braid out because braid outs give you

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.260 
braid out because braid outs give you
more<00:01:57.899> attention<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:59.039> twist<00:01:59.340> outs<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.060> that's

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
more attention then twist outs so that's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.969 
more attention then twist outs so that's
automatically<00:02:01.049> gonna<00:02:01.319> straighten<00:02:01.709> the<00:02:01.829> hair

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
automatically gonna straighten the hair

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.519 
automatically gonna straighten the hair
out<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> give<00:02:02.639> you<00:02:02.759> more<00:02:02.999> shine<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.139> your<00:02:04.229> hair

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
out and give you more shine to your hair

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.190 
out and give you more shine to your hair
the<00:02:05.159> second<00:02:05.490> thing<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.209> moisture<00:02:06.779> balance

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the second thing how to moisture balance

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.980 
the second thing how to moisture balance
now<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:07.770> need<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.250> maintain<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:09.000> protein<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
now you need to maintain the protein and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.020 
now you need to maintain the protein and
moisture<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.099> hair<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.700> times

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
moisture in your hair at all times

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.960 
moisture in your hair at all times
because<00:02:12.750> when<00:02:13.470> your<00:02:13.650> hair<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.860> filled<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.459> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
because when your hair is filled in you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.330 
because when your hair is filled in you
will<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.360> flat<00:02:15.720> surface<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.709> light<00:02:17.130> to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
will have a flat surface for light to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.730 
will have a flat surface for light to
bounce<00:02:17.490> off<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.900> therefore<00:02:18.900> giving<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.440> more

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
bounce off of therefore giving you more

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.809 
bounce off of therefore giving you more
shine<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.330> how<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.110> maintain<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
shine so how do you maintain the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.940 
shine so how do you maintain the
Seymour<00:02:23.239> serve<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.569> say<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.319> just<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:24.799> it

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
Seymour serve on say it is just like it

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.740 
Seymour serve on say it is just like it
sounds<00:02:25.459> put<00:02:25.790> more<00:02:25.939> protein<00:02:26.299> on<00:02:26.450> when<00:02:26.659> your

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
sounds put more protein on when your

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.780 
sounds put more protein on when your
hair<00:02:26.900> needs<00:02:27.109> protein<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.859> stop<00:02:28.370> doing<00:02:28.579> the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
hair needs protein and stop doing the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.160 
hair needs protein and stop doing the
protein<00:02:29.239> when<00:02:29.420> your<00:02:29.569> hair<00:02:29.719> doesn't<00:02:30.079> need

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
protein when your hair doesn't need

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.289 
protein when your hair doesn't need
protein<00:02:30.590> that's<00:02:31.129> how<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.430> maintain<00:02:32.000> a

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
protein that's how you maintain a

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.330 
protein that's how you maintain a
protein<00:02:32.900> moisture<00:02:33.230> balance<00:02:33.590> your<00:02:33.739> hair<00:02:33.890> you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
protein moisture balance your hair you

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.399 
protein moisture balance your hair you
should<00:02:34.430> always<00:02:34.760> be<00:02:35.209> moisturizing<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:36.140> hair

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
do the protein a little bit more when

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.149 
do the protein a little bit more when
your<00:02:43.819> hair<00:02:43.970> needs<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.629> do<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.769> shea

very<00:03:40.340> humid<00:03:40.879> or<00:03:41.180> very<00:03:41.629> hot<00:03:41.989> or<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.790> are<00:03:44.090> using

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
very humid or very hot or you are using

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.640 
very humid or very hot or you are using
a<00:03:45.139> pH<00:03:45.409> of<00:03:45.889> 8<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.459> 9<00:03:46.959> that's<00:03:47.959> gonna<00:03:48.260> make<00:03:48.500> your

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
a pH of 8 and 9 that's gonna make your

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.349 
a pH of 8 and 9 that's gonna make your
cuticles<00:03:49.190> up<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.639> it's<00:03:49.790> gonna<00:03:49.940> be<00:03:50.060> really

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
cuticles up and it's gonna be really

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.539 
cuticles up and it's gonna be really
awful<00:03:50.540> ok<00:03:51.139> so<00:03:51.199> just<00:03:51.379> make<00:03:51.680> sure<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.519> a

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
awful ok so just make sure that is a

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.520 
awful ok so just make sure that is a
factor<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.299> if<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.690> feel<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:54.109> you're<00:03:54.260> doing

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
factor so if you feel like you're doing

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.319 
factor so if you feel like you're doing
everything<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.430> your<00:03:55.579> hair<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:55.849> still<00:03:56.060> kind

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
everything but your hair is still kind

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.869 
everything but your hair is still kind
of<00:03:56.389> frizzin<00:03:56.840> out<00:03:56.959> that's<00:03:57.650> why<00:03:57.949> maybe<00:03:58.340> it's<00:03:58.609> too

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
of frizzin out that's why maybe it's too

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.689 
of frizzin out that's why maybe it's too
hot<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.479> humid<00:03:59.930> where<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.409> are<00:04:00.590> maybe<00:04:01.370> you're

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699 
hot and humid where you are maybe you're

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.949 
hot and humid where you are maybe you're
using<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.329> power

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
using to power

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.809 
using to power
I<00:04:03.109> still<00:04:03.379> use<00:04:03.409> warm<00:04:03.829> water<00:04:03.919> to<00:04:04.310> wash<00:04:04.489> my<00:04:04.699> hair

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
I still use warm water to wash my hair

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.780 
I still use warm water to wash my hair
because<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.239> can't<00:04:05.659> bother<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.650> know<00:04:07.129> I<00:04:07.250> can't<00:04:07.699> do

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
because I can't bother I know I can't do

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.619 
because I can't bother I know I can't do
with<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:07.970> cold<00:04:08.180> water

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
with the cold water

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.719 
with the cold water
I<00:04:08.659> do<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.500> rinses<00:04:09.889> but<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.129> keep<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.609> like

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
I do the rinses but I keep it like

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.759 
I do the rinses but I keep it like
lukewarm<00:04:11.090> because<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.870> can't<00:04:12.139> do<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.379> freezing

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
lukewarm because I can't do the freezing

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.060 
lukewarm because I can't do the freezing
goal<00:04:12.949> thing<00:04:13.189> ok<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.900> yeah<00:04:15.109> just<00:04:15.680> keep<00:04:15.859> that<00:04:16.010> in

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
goal thing ok so yeah just keep that in

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.069 
goal thing ok so yeah just keep that in
mind<00:04:16.400> but<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.760> don't<00:04:17.060> obsess<00:04:17.539> about<00:04:17.840> those

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
mind but I don't obsess about those

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.259 
mind but I don't obsess about those
things<00:04:18.380> because<00:04:18.829> they<00:04:19.430> are<00:04:19.699> by<00:04:20.000> nature

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
things because they are by nature

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.540 
things because they are by nature
obsessive<00:04:21.229> they're<00:04:21.470> always<00:04:21.680> changing<00:04:22.190> and

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
I used to shower and wash my hair with

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.340 
I used to shower and wash my hair with
this<00:04:34.790> fluctuating<00:04:35.540> so<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.720> just<00:04:35.900> don't<00:04:36.080> focus

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
this fluctuating so I just don't focus

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.950 
this fluctuating so I just don't focus
on<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.860> so<00:04:37.010> much<00:04:37.220> because<00:04:37.520> I<00:04:37.940> want<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.810> drive

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
on it so much because I want to drive

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.540 
on it so much because I want to drive
myself<00:04:39.320> crazy<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:39.980> would<00:04:40.130> suggest<00:04:40.310> that

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
myself crazy and I would suggest that

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.850 
myself crazy and I would suggest that
for<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:40.940> as<00:04:41.090> well<00:04:41.300> so<00:04:41.360> just<00:04:41.690> don't<00:04:42.080> don't

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
for you as well so just don't don't

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.560 
for you as well so just don't don't
really<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.130> don't<00:04:43.310> think<00:04:43.490> about<00:04:43.669> it<00:04:43.880> somebody

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
really I don't think about it somebody

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.570 
really I don't think about it somebody
well<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.840> can<00:04:45.110> think<00:04:45.590> about<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.919> bogus<00:04:46.400> time

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
well you can think about a bogus time

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.790 
well you can think about a bogus time
that<00:04:46.820> makes<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.150> big<00:04:47.389> difference<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:48.440> the

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
that makes a big difference is the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.340 
that makes a big difference is the
protein<00:04:49.310> moisture<00:04:49.880> balance<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:51.169> that's

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
protein moisture balance and that's

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.219 
protein moisture balance and that's
gonna<00:04:51.500> fill<00:04:51.889> in<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.850> holes<00:04:53.120> in<00:04:53.360> your<00:04:53.479> hair<00:04:53.720> you

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
gonna fill in the holes in your hair you

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.050 
gonna fill in the holes in your hair you
know<00:04:54.380> what's<00:04:54.650> what's<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.100> point<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.580> protein

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
know what's what's the point the protein

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.480 
know what's what's the point the protein
treatments<00:04:56.960> fill<00:04:57.560> in<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.860> holes<00:04:58.130> in<00:04:58.340> your

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
treatments fill in the holes in your

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.580 
treatments fill in the holes in your
hair<00:04:58.699> that<00:04:58.729> are<00:04:59.030> naturally<00:04:59.750> created<00:05:00.290> because

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
hair that are naturally created because

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.460 
hair that are naturally created because
the<00:05:00.710> hair<00:05:00.949> all<00:05:01.490> hair<00:05:01.990> some<00:05:02.990> people<00:05:03.290> more<00:05:03.410> than

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
the hair all hair some people more than

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.190 
the hair all hair some people more than
others<00:05:03.680> naturally<00:05:04.580> lose<00:05:04.729> protein<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.600> that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
others naturally lose protein and that

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.370 
others naturally lose protein and that
creates<00:05:06.650> gaps<00:05:07.280> in<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.880> hair<00:05:07.910> shaft<00:05:08.300> which<00:05:08.990> do

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
creates gaps in the hair shaft which do

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.580 
creates gaps in the hair shaft which do
not<00:05:09.410> allow<00:05:09.740> light<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.550> reflect<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:11.300> refract

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
not allow light to reflect and refract

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.390 
not allow light to reflect and refract
which<00:05:12.590> can<00:05:12.919> create<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.580> dull<00:05:14.350> effect<00:05:15.350> so<00:05:16.220> when

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
which can create a dull effect so when

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.250 
which can create a dull effect so when
the<00:05:16.550> holes<00:05:16.790> are<00:05:16.970> filled<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:18.050> have<00:05:18.229> a

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
the holes are filled in you have a

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.460 
the holes are filled in you have a
flatter<00:05:18.590> surface<00:05:18.860> light<00:05:19.850> bounces<00:05:20.630> off<00:05:20.840> you

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
flatter surface light bounces off you

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.530 
flatter surface light bounces off you
