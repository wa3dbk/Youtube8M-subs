 Republicans who met with

 work 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.990
 how 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.080
 how can that be so the president 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.810
 will act but will act because still 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.640
 those 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.890
 who have indicated that they want to work 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.720
 Us fled and were later 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.040
 of Republicans' refusal to 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 address the issue of reform 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.180
 migratory is representative Luis 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.430
 Gutiérrez believes that the president still 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.830
 can do a lot for immigrants 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.770
 undocumented that I think he's going to 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.930
 be me I think he's going to literally 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.360
 free millions of undocumented immigrants from 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.220
 of deportation is what I think 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.350
 it's going to be how many millions I do not know but 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.790
 I do not think there will be thousands I think 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.320
 that are going to be much more than 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.780
 dreamers who are little more than 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 six hundred thousand of them likewise 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.830
 Gutierrez said that dreamers do not 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.360
 they should worry about losing daca but 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.030
 to prepare to teach 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.220
 register the dreamers what they have 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.710
 what to prepare is for the announcement of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.660
 president because if it's how broad I 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.360
 I think it's going to be where they have to 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.040
 take your good education and the fact of 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.320
 that they have a document and have passed 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.140
 for the process and help your father to 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.910
 fill out those papers by asking the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.070
 congressman about the future of the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.140
 thousands of immigrant children detained in 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.060
 the border his answer was not so 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.759
 encouraging and believes that most 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.179
