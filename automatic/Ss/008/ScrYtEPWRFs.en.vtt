00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.329 
and so the last move by white knight Ito
was<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> mistake<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.649> pause<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
was a mistake and you can pause this

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:57.459 
was a mistake and you can pause this
video<00:00:50.609> to<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:52.159> that<00:00:53.159> was<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> mistake

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.160 

okay<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> mistake<00:00:59.430> because<00:01:00.170> black

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
okay that was a mistake because black

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.539 
okay that was a mistake because black
can<00:01:01.199> play<00:01:02.360> Bishop<00:01:03.500> h3<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.990> bishop<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.770> h3

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.899 
is untouchable because if white takes
bishop<00:01:13.880> then<00:01:14.880> black<00:01:15.869> plays<00:01:16.110> Knight<00:01:17.929> f3<00:01:18.929> fork

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.279 

because<00:01:50.160> three<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.610> its<00:01:50.789> species<00:01:51.330> on<00:01:52.050> the

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
because three of its species on the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.190 
because three of its species on the
attack<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.220> look<00:01:53.459> on<00:01:53.789> each<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.610> attack

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
attack so look on each one on the attack

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.759 
attack so look on each one on the attack
night<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.739> attack<00:01:59.099> and<00:02:00.229> Bishop<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.379> on<00:02:01.410> the

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:01.769 
night on the attack and Bishop is on the

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:08.660 
night on the attack and Bishop is on the
attack<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.640> wide<00:02:03.599> resigned<00:02:07.670> well

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
attack so here wide resigned well

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.199 
attack so here wide resigned well
actually<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> better<00:02:10.170> move<00:02:11.209> white

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
actually there was a better move white

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.500 
actually there was a better move white
if<00:02:12.569> white<00:02:12.989> castle's<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.900> black<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.410> play

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
if white castle's then black would play

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.899 
if white castle's then black would play
Knight<00:02:18.510> takes<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.260> f3<00:02:19.440> anyway<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:23.090> check<00:02:24.090> and

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
Knight takes on f3 anyway so check and

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.850 
Knight takes on f3 anyway so check and
actually<00:02:26.909> it's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.120> fork<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.720> king<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.560> queen

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
actually it's a fork on king and queen

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.780 
actually it's a fork on king and queen
so<00:02:29.390> white<00:02:30.390> has<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.720> take<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.319> night<00:02:31.790> then

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
so white has to take this night then

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.470 
so white has to take this night then
black<00:02:33.450> takes<00:02:33.780> rook<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.280> rook<00:02:35.970> takes<00:02:36.269> Bishop

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
black takes rook and rook takes Bishop

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.970 
black takes rook and rook takes Bishop
so<00:02:37.170> calm<00:02:39.500> black<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.739> up<00:02:41.489> exchange<00:02:42.480> raw<00:02:43.379> versus

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so calm black is up exchange raw versus

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.339 
so calm black is up exchange raw versus
Bishop<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.659> situation<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:48.200> even<00:02:49.200> in

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
Bishop in this situation but even in

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.250 
Bishop in this situation but even in
this<00:02:49.500> situation<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:52.439> black<00:02:52.709> is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
this situation the black is

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.830 
this situation the black is
significant<00:02:55.260> clue<00:02:55.440> by<00:02:55.620> them
