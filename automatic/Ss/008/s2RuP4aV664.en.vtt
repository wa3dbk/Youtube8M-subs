let's go ahead and build up some
warriors<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.230> thought<00:00:16.410> they<00:00:16.560> would<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
warriors I thought they would be the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.720 
warriors I thought they would be the
best<00:00:17.550> troop<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.199> gem<00:00:19.980> those<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.460> here

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
best troop to do this gem those up here

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.279 
best troop to do this gem those up here
we<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> thousand<00:00:21.660> five<00:00:21.840> hundred<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
we have a thousand five hundred and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
we have a thousand five hundred and
eleven<00:00:22.380> gems<00:00:22.920> left<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.609> let's<00:00:24.119> attack<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
eleven gems left and let's attack this I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.929 
eleven gems left and let's attack this I
have<00:00:25.019> everything<00:00:25.260> boosted<00:00:25.859> um<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:28.699> let's<00:00:29.699> see

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
have everything boosted um and let's see

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.209 
have everything boosted um and let's see
right<00:00:30.150> looking<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:32.160> we

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
right looking at this here I think we

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.819 
right looking at this here I think we
should<00:00:32.369> probably<00:00:32.520> throw<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> barrage<00:00:33.829> right

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
should probably throw a barrage right

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
should probably throw a barrage right
there<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:38.120> hope<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.450> takes<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.960> those

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
there and hope that it takes out those

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
there and hope that it takes out those
boom<00:00:40.469> mines<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:43.160> think<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> should<00:00:44.399> take<00:00:44.610> out

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
boom mines I think it should take out

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.119 
boom mines I think it should take out
more<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> those<00:00:45.899> though<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.469> gonna<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:47.039> gonna

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
more of those though I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:57.260 
more of those though I'm gonna I'm gonna
try<00:00:47.430> again<00:00:49.430> alright

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.640 

throw<00:00:58.270> a<00:00:58.329> little<00:00:58.480> bit<00:00:58.719> farther<00:00:58.989> up<00:01:04.560> that<00:01:05.560> was

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
throw a little bit farther up that was

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.340 
throw a little bit farther up that was
pretty<00:01:05.860> good<00:01:06.100> there's<00:01:06.880> one<00:01:07.210> left<00:01:07.509> but<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.840> think

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
pretty good there's one left but I think

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.770 
pretty good there's one left but I think
we<00:01:09.190> should<00:01:09.369> be<00:01:09.460> fine<00:01:09.700> all<00:01:10.450> right

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
we should be fine all right

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.160 
we should be fine all right
so<00:01:11.350> drop<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:11.979> Warriors<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.750> hopefully

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
so drop the Warriors there hopefully

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
so drop the Warriors there hopefully
just<00:01:14.350> going<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.530> automatically<00:01:15.130> run<00:01:15.369> up<00:01:15.550> there

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
just going to automatically run up there

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.359 
just going to automatically run up there
so<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.320> mortar<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.649> probably<00:01:17.890> going<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.100> shoot

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
so the mortar is probably going to shoot

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.960 
so the mortar is probably going to shoot
and<00:01:18.580> miss<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.110> got<00:01:20.259> one<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:21.759> gonna

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
and miss actually it got one I'm gonna

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.149 
and miss actually it got one I'm gonna
have<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.210> shock<00:01:22.479> bomb<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.619> it<00:01:23.680> doesn't<00:01:24.009> pick

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
have to shock bomb it so it doesn't pick

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.370 
have to shock bomb it so it doesn't pick
off<00:01:24.340> any<00:01:24.550> more<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.840> then<00:01:25.930> we're<00:01:26.049> hopefully

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
off any more and then we're hopefully

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.510 
off any more and then we're hopefully
just<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.680> let<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.860> Warriors<00:01:27.100> go<00:01:27.460> to

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
just going to let the Warriors go to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.120 
just going to let the Warriors go to
work<00:01:27.759> here<00:01:28.060> um<00:01:28.560> hopefully<00:01:29.560> it's<00:01:29.950> going<00:01:30.070> to

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
work here um hopefully it's going to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.359 
work here um hopefully it's going to
look<00:01:30.429> at<00:01:30.580> them<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:30.940> then<00:01:31.060> miss<00:01:31.800> like<00:01:32.800> that

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
look at them and then miss like that

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.790 
look at them and then miss like that
maybe<00:01:34.360> there<00:01:35.259> we<00:01:35.410> go

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
maybe there we go

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.410 
maybe there we go
and<00:01:35.920> then<00:01:36.399> we<00:01:36.490> can<00:01:36.640> go<00:01:36.729> ahead<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.060> flare<00:01:37.300> to

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
and then we can go ahead and flare to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.460 
and then we can go ahead and flare to
the<00:01:37.450> HQ<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.229> begin<00:01:38.500> smoking<00:01:38.830> right<00:01:39.280> there<00:01:40.470> two

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
the HQ and begin smoking right there two

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.630 
the HQ and begin smoking right there two
three<00:01:42.220> four<00:01:43.050> if<00:01:44.050> we<00:01:44.740> win<00:01:45.130> this<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.460> will<00:01:45.610> be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
three four if we win this this will be

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.029 
three four if we win this this will be
huge

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
huge

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.010 
huge
all<00:01:48.039> right<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:48.310> we<00:01:48.399> have<00:01:48.429> 75<00:01:49.179> gumbo<00:01:49.659> energy

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
all right so we have 75 gumbo energy

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.139 
all right so we have 75 gumbo energy
left<00:01:50.229> let's<00:01:50.679> go<00:01:50.800> ahead<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.190> wait<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:52.060> that

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
left let's go ahead and wait for that

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.240 
left let's go ahead and wait for that
smoke<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.539> wear<00:01:52.690> off<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.140> then<00:01:53.560> shop<00:01:53.800> I'm<00:01:54.009> here

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
smoke to wear off and then shop I'm here

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.850 
smoke to wear off and then shop I'm here
here<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:54.850> here<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.710> hopefully<00:01:56.710> that'll

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
here here and here and hopefully that'll

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.649 
here here and here and hopefully that'll
be<00:01:56.950> enough<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.850> Warriors<00:01:58.270> are<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.509> going<00:01:58.600> to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
be enough the Warriors are just going to

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.779 
be enough the Warriors are just going to
wipe<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.080> HQ<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.800> pieces<00:02:00.250> even<00:02:00.580> though<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
wipe that HQ to pieces even though the

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.940 
wipe that HQ to pieces even though the
super<00:02:01.119> mortar<00:02:01.420> did<00:02:01.869> get<00:02:02.080> off<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.289> couple<00:02:02.739> shots

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
super mortar did get off a couple shots

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.830 
super mortar did get off a couple shots
so<00:02:03.190> that<00:02:03.340> was<00:02:03.429> like<00:02:03.550> four<00:02:03.910> shots<00:02:04.209> what<00:02:04.479> was<00:02:04.660> it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
so that was like four shots what was it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.690 
so that was like four shots what was it

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
three um and they're just going to go

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.570 
three um and they're just going to go
ahead<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.179> wreck<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.380> base<00:02:08.649> we<00:02:09.069> got<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.250> ton

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
ahead and wreck that base we got a ton

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.850 
ahead and wreck that base we got a ton
of<00:02:09.610> life<00:02:09.880> crystals<00:02:10.360> no<00:02:11.080> how<00:02:11.410> can<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.709> be<00:02:11.830> I

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
of life crystals no how can it be I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.410 
of life crystals no how can it be I
planned<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.310> base<00:02:12.520> perfectly<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.150> now<00:02:13.239> it's

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
planned this base perfectly and now it's

it<00:03:22.090> for<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.269> episode<00:03:22.620> didn't<00:03:23.620> really<00:03:23.769> take

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
it for this episode didn't really take

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.140 
it for this episode didn't really take
too<00:03:24.159> long<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.519> thought<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.730> was<00:03:24.819> going<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:24.970> take
