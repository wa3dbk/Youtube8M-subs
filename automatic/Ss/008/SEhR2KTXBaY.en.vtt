redstone<00:01:52.860> energy<00:01:53.340> cell<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
redstone energy cell here and as you can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.870 
redstone energy cell here and as you can
see<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.140> slowly<00:01:55.439> ticking<00:01:55.860> away<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
see it's slowly ticking away at the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
see it's slowly ticking away at the
power<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> needs<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.840> sustained<00:01:58.380> power

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
power so it needs a sustained power

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.800 
power so it needs a sustained power
source<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.570> online

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
source and you can see that it's online

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.310 
source and you can see that it's online
now<00:02:01.759> this<00:02:02.759> alone<00:02:03.329> does<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.110> anything

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
now this alone does not do anything

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.010 
now this alone does not do anything
other<00:02:04.619> than<00:02:04.860> tie<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> wireless<00:02:06.360> controller<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
other than tie a wireless controller to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
other than tie a wireless controller to
it<00:02:07.110> which<00:02:07.259> will<00:02:07.409> get<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.950> later<00:02:08.160> part<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it which will get in in a later part so

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.460 
it which will get in in a later part so
the<00:02:09.509> next<00:02:09.539> part<00:02:09.899> we're<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.289> looking

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the next part we're going to be looking

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.440 
the next part we're going to be looking
at<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.890> emmy<00:02:11.069> chest

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
at is the emmy chest

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.300 
at is the emmy chest
here's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.290> recipe<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.160> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
here's a recipe for that and the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.000 
here's a recipe for that and the
conversion<00:02:14.790> matrix<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.360> made<00:02:15.569> like<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
conversion matrix is made like so and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.130 
conversion matrix is made like so and
you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:17.849> another<00:02:18.030> basic<00:02:18.450> processor<00:02:18.930> this

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you can see another basic processor this

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.020 
you can see another basic processor this
one<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:19.890> made<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.610> gold<00:02:20.879> ingot

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
one is the one made with a gold ingot

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.240 
one is the one made with a gold ingot
same<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.900> diamond<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.470> replace<00:02:22.769> with

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
same as the diamond just replace with

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.460 
same as the diamond just replace with
gold<00:02:23.489> ingot<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.019> said<00:02:25.080> you're<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.410> to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
gold ingot like I said you're going to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.990 
gold ingot like I said you're going to
be<00:02:25.560> needing<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:26.010> ton<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> these<00:02:26.849> now<00:02:28.310> any<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
be needing a ton of these now any of the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.420 
be needing a ton of these now any of the
Emmy<00:02:30.300> or<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.900> Applied<00:02:31.530> Energy<00:02:31.920> six<00:02:32.130> pieces

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
Emmy or the Applied Energy six pieces

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.680 
Emmy or the Applied Energy six pieces
that<00:02:32.670> are<00:02:32.790> placed<00:02:32.940> next<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.239> each<00:02:33.330> other<00:02:33.420> will

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
that are placed next to each other will

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.449 
that are placed next to each other will
draw<00:02:33.930> power<00:02:34.230> from<00:02:34.380> each<00:02:34.769> other<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.280> can

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
draw power from each other so you can

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.850 
draw power from each other so you can
see<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.910> now<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:37.140> be<00:02:37.230> powered<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.800> you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
see that this now can be powered and you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.380 
see that this now can be powered and you
can<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.790> chest<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.209> here

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
can see that it's here the chest is here

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.589 
can see that it's here the chest is here
now<00:02:40.200> alone<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.860> chest<00:02:41.190> does<00:02:41.370> nothing<00:02:41.849> what

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
now alone this chest does nothing what

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.380 
now alone this chest does nothing what
you<00:02:42.720> need<00:02:42.989> are<00:02:45.290> some<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> these<00:02:46.500> storage<00:02:46.920> units

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
you need are some of these storage units

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.690 
you need are some of these storage units
there's<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:48.569> k4k<00:02:49.430> 16<00:02:50.430> k<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.849> 64<00:02:51.510> k<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:53.130> let<00:02:53.610> me

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
there's one k4k 16 k and 64 k and let me

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.050 
there's one k4k 16 k and 64 k and let me
just<00:02:53.880> grab<00:02:54.230> one<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.260> those<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.980> recipe<00:02:59.459> for

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
just grab one of those so the recipe for

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.610 
just grab one of those so the recipe for
this<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:01.579> as<00:03:02.579> seen<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.780> 1k<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.410> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
this is as seen here for the 1k as you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.910 
this is as seen here for the 1k as you
go<00:03:04.739> up<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.880> storage<00:03:06.870> size<00:03:07.140> they<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.530> get

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
go up in in storage size they do get

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.490 
go up in in storage size they do get
more<00:03:08.160> complex<00:03:08.690> when<00:03:09.690> you're<00:03:09.810> looking<00:03:10.140> at<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
more complex when you're looking at the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860 
more complex when you're looking at the
storage<00:03:10.920> unit<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.760> see<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:11.910> 0<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.450> 100

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
storage unit you can see that 0 of 100

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.470 
storage unit you can see that 0 of 100
earth<00:03:13.019> 0<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.950> thousand<00:03:14.400> 24<00:03:14.819> bytes<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.269> used

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
earth 0 of a thousand 24 bytes is used

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.220 
earth 0 of a thousand 24 bytes is used
of<00:03:15.690> n<00:03:16.019> 0<00:03:16.410> 63<00:03:17.100> types<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.970> these<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.690> each<00:03:18.959> hold

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
of n 0 63 types so these can each hold

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.069 
of n 0 63 types so these can each hold
63<00:03:19.950> different<00:03:20.100> types<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.639> items<00:03:21.120> from<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
63 different types of items from the

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.559 
63 different types of items from the
game<00:03:22.290> depending<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.370> how<00:03:23.459> big<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.790> them<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
game depending on how big of them of a

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.569 
game depending on how big of them of a
storage<00:03:25.109> unit<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.440> have<00:03:25.470> they<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.100> hold<00:03:26.250> more

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
storage unit you have they can hold more

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.120 
storage unit you have they can hold more
of<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.780> here's<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.109> recipe<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.709> 1k

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
of that so here's the recipe for the 1k

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.819 
of that so here's the recipe for the 1k
it's<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.459> very<00:03:29.639> smallest<00:03:30.530> storage<00:03:31.530> cell<00:03:31.709> is

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
it's the very smallest storage cell is

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.140 
it's the very smallest storage cell is
made<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.549> again<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.819> can<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
made like this and again you can see the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.270 
made like this and again you can see the
basic<00:03:33.510> processor<00:03:34.079> which<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.530> made<00:03:34.709> out<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.069> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
basic processor which is made out of the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.830 
basic processor which is made out of the
biggest<00:03:35.579> basic<00:03:36.030> cooking<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.480> basic

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
biggest basic cooking the basic

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.780 
biggest basic cooking the basic
processor<00:03:37.680> assembly<00:03:37.799> which<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.459> showed<00:03:38.609> you

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
processor assembly which I showed you

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.199 
processor assembly which I showed you
before<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:40.280> now<00:03:41.280> when<00:03:41.609> you're<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> Emmy

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
before so now when you're in the Emmy

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.720 
before so now when you're in the Emmy
chest<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.079> can<00:03:43.230> take<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.459> put<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.670> right

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
chest you can take this and put it right
