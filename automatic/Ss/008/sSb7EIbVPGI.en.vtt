00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
can just select segments of it say I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.070 
can just select segments of it say I
like<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.430> segment<00:02:55.880> here<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.240> can<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.870> drag

like this segment here I can just drag

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.699 
like this segment here I can just drag
over<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:58.730> create<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.150> loop<00:02:59.480> region<00:02:59.750> that

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
over it to create a loop region that

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.770 
over it to create a loop region that
represents<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.250> segment<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.850> when<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> drag

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
represents this segment and when I drag

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.040 
represents this segment and when I drag
from<00:03:03.770> that<00:03:03.950> time<00:03:04.220> line<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:05.360> my<00:03:05.480> timeline<00:03:05.840> I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
from that time line to my timeline I

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.310 
from that time line to my timeline I
only<00:03:06.590> get<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:06.980> selected<00:03:07.640> segment<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.290> I

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
only get that selected segment and so I

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.590 
only get that selected segment and so I
