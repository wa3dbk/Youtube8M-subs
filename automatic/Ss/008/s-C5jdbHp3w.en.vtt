00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
right they stand a better chance at

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.060 
right they stand a better chance at
winning<00:00:42.899> more<00:00:43.079> games<00:00:43.290> believe<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:43.980> not

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
ever play the game Kobe I get a little

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.929 
ever play the game Kobe I get a little
pissy<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.710> he<00:02:01.890> didn't<00:02:02.070> get<00:02:02.130> his<00:02:02.219> touches<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.640> lot

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
pissy if he didn't get his touches a lot

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.550 
pissy if he didn't get his touches a lot
like<00:02:03.149> Dwight<00:02:03.420> did<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> beginning<00:02:04.170> but

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
like Dwight did the beginning but

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
like Dwight did the beginning but
everyone<00:02:04.950> bitched<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.399> Dwight<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.000> think

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
everyone bitched at Dwight and I think

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.459 
everyone bitched at Dwight and I think
it's<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.390> he<00:02:06.540> doesn't<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.049> Rings

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it's because he doesn't have the Rings

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.820 
it's because he doesn't have the Rings
that<00:02:07.649> Kobe<00:02:08.099> does<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:09.209> i<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:10.110> i<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.770> you
