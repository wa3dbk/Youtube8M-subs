00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.970
 and of merz has declared impetus to the saga 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.109
 see myself as a young man 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:20.910
 What do you think of this comparison so I 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:26.820
 I know is what we meet for 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.179
 races in Qatar Oman then also others have it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 said he but I do not feel to be in 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.540
 can now say the same 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 what, however, I would like to become 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.129
 peeters a gun and marx with all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.579
 respect that he because he is an idol 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.899
 for all it is a legend that that in 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.270
 course 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:01.500
 I'm very glad you said one 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:03.329
 What seems so much that six 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 considered the rising star of the new 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 cycling by many a new mercks 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.760
 indeed, yet for many it is eternal 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.299
 second 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.820
 what you answer I have arrived at 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:21.060
 cycling as eder saga also I do bce 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.250
 I enjoy his bike on then maybe I have 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.119
 also brought something new to cycling 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.460
 that I didn't even know it did 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.869
 something new because it came to me 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.439
 mountain biking always the same, but they are not 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.009
 so some don't mind some not 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.320
 I like what I think I am going up front 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.180
 so do cycling do my maximum 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.840
 to do well 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.979
 just fiandre roubaix what dreams of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.759
 win in Flanders Roubaix 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.180
 yes first then oil both then 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.460
 I believe that both are important 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.110
 sinti pÃ©ter how to run with alberto 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.750
 contador in the team or for 3 1 who was there 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.750
 so much experience is a yes 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.890
 knows several characteristics of me certain 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.610
 but I like being with him in a team 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.670
 and surely it can also give me so much 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.410
 experience for many kids you're already 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.020
 an idol maybe because of your way 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.410
 run a little out of the rules that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.050
 advice you'd give to them I do n't know 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.050
 for what can i say 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.840
 a life seems hard but sometimes me 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.440
 so many things have come 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.360
 I don't say easy but it's always me 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.820
 I enjoyed myself as a child and all things 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 the sun was opening which I never have 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.630
 thought to reach the prof that always 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.050
 I was riding bike and in the end I 'm here 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.390
 among professionals who occasionally 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:14.350
 I wonder what I do here but what 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:20.019
 I can advise young people to live 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.610
 quiet and have fun at the Tyrrhenian Sea 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.590
 Adriatic we saw you doing a 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.269
 tightrope walker number to not miss 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.220
 the balance after a curve in one 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.500
 chronometer a number of put of the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.610
 cycling as you did 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.350
 I don't know if I have luck though if I was 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:43.540
 glad that I managed to stay in 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:49.410
 bike yes no I did not expect it to slip 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.410
 the wheel, however, sometimes happens
