00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
9 and along with iOS 8 point for the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.200 
9 and along with iOS 8 point for the
jailbreakers<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.220> not<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.550> access<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.090> those

jailbreakers do not have access to those

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
jailbreakers do not have access to those
softwares<00:00:42.720> yet<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.050> would<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.470> sort<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
softwares yet so would be sort of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
softwares yet so would be sort of
pointless<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.340> them<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> develop<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.329> iOS<00:00:45.660> 8.3

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
pointless for them to develop an iOS 8.3

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
pointless for them to develop an iOS 8.3
jailbreak<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.130> as<00:00:47.220> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.520> i'll<00:00:47.610> scroll

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
jailbreak so as you can see i'll scroll

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520 
jailbreak so as you can see i'll scroll
down<00:00:47.970> here<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.270> says<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.630> actual<00:00:49.020> conference

have a couple weeks before this and the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
have a couple weeks before this and the
jailbreakers<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.829> tend<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.579> wait<00:01:00.120> until

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
jailbreakers really tend to wait until

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
jailbreakers really tend to wait until
they<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.629> full<00:01:00.870> access<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
they have full access to all the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
they have full access to all the
software<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> knowing<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.390> actual

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
software and knowing that the actual

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
software and knowing that the actual
conference<00:01:04.440> is<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.770> be<00:01:04.860> happening<00:01:05.040> then

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
conference is going to be happening then

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.480 
conference is going to be happening then
when<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.850> release<00:01:06.149> iOS<00:01:06.360> 9<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.470> iOS<00:01:07.740> 8.4

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
when they release iOS 9 and iOS 8.4

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.960 
when they release iOS 9 and iOS 8.4
which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> actually<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.140> June<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:11.220> would<00:01:11.729> not

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
which is actually in June it would not

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.280 
which is actually in June it would not
really<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.540> sense<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.930> them<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.080> release

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
really make sense for them to release

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.219 
really make sense for them to release
the<00:01:13.619> iOS<00:01:13.979> 8.3<00:01:14.400> jailbreak<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.510> saying

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the iOS 8.3 jailbreak right now saying

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
the iOS 8.3 jailbreak right now saying
that<00:01:16.440> they<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:16.979> probably<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.820> start

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that they actually probably will start

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.960 
that they actually probably will start
developing<00:01:18.510> iOS<00:01:18.869> 91<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.680> OS<00:01:19.950> 8.41<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:20.880> they

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
developing iOS 91 the OS 8.41 when they

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
developing iOS 91 the OS 8.41 when they
get<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> hands<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.510> their<00:01:21.600> software<00:01:21.960> right

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
get the hands on their software right

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.600 
get the hands on their software right
now<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> wouldn't<00:01:22.950> expect<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> come<00:01:23.549> out

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
now I wouldn't expect it to come out

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
now I wouldn't expect it to come out
until<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.420> least<00:01:24.659> two<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.049> three<00:01:25.229> weeks<00:01:25.260> from

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
until at least two or three weeks from

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
until at least two or three weeks from
now<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> WWDC<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.510> they

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
now when the WWDC is going on and they

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
now when the WWDC is going on and they
actually<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> betas<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.590> their<00:01:28.710> hands

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
actually have the betas in their hands

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.250 
actually have the betas in their hands
that<00:01:29.580> being<00:01:29.850> said<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.360> think<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.020> about

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
that being said I think it will be about

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.890 
that being said I think it will be about
the<00:01:31.470> same<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.280> pangu<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.060> tyco<00:01:33.270> jailbreak

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the same as the pangu and tyco jailbreak

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050 
the same as the pangu and tyco jailbreak
tools<00:01:34.170> were<00:01:34.500> it'll<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.460> click<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.760> hook

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
tools were it'll be one click you hook

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
tools were it'll be one click you hook
up<00:01:36.180> your<00:01:36.270> device<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.570> we'll<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.409> simple

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
up your device and we'll just be simple

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
up your device and we'll just be simple
no<00:01:38.549> problems<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.270> jailbreaking<00:01:40.140> is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
no problems at all jailbreaking is

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.539 
no problems at all jailbreaking is
getting<00:01:40.500> tougher<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.830> tougher<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.310> think

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
getting tougher and tougher but I think

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.820 
getting tougher and tougher but I think
it'll<00:01:41.700> still<00:01:42.030> remain<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> way<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.740> those

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
it'll still remain that way so for those

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.560 
it'll still remain that way so for those
of<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.070> don't<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.580> egan<00:01:44.909> Pangu<00:01:45.420> are

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
your device I expect the jailbreak to be

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.610 
your device I expect the jailbreak to be
just<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.420> however<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.320> terms<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
just like that however in terms of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
just like that however in terms of
release<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.190> expect<00:02:14.820> them<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.030> release<00:02:15.239> its

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
release I expect them to release its

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.509 
release I expect them to release its
sometime<00:02:15.959> around<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.260> WWDC<00:02:16.889> a<00:02:17.100> couple<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
sometime around the WWDC a couple of

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.500 
sometime around the WWDC a couple of
weeks<00:02:17.669> from<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.060> wouldn't<00:02:18.419> really

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
weeks from now is it wouldn't really

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.270 
weeks from now is it wouldn't really
make<00:02:18.690> sense<00:02:18.930> before<00:02:19.169> that<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.889> terms<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
make sense before that in terms of the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.680 
make sense before that in terms of the
Apple<00:02:20.579> watch<00:02:20.669> jailbreak<00:02:21.180> actually<00:02:21.359> had<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
Apple watch jailbreak actually had the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.300 
Apple watch jailbreak actually had the
Apple<00:02:21.930> watch

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
Apple watch

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.120 
Apple watch
right<00:02:22.550> here<00:02:22.819> as<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.120> can<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.739> think<00:02:24.770> it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
right here as you can see and I think it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.710 
right here as you can see and I think it
will<00:02:25.190> actually<00:02:25.459> be<00:02:25.849> very<00:02:26.060> cool<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.450> see<00:02:26.569> what

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
will actually be very cool to see what

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.000 
will actually be very cool to see what
they<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:26.870> do<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.620> Apple<00:02:27.890> watch

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
they can do with that the Apple watch

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.949 
they can do with that the Apple watch
actually<00:02:28.250> runs<00:02:28.550> through<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> iphone<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:29.540> all

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
actually runs through the iphone so all

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:30.970 
actually runs through the iphone so all
you<00:02:30.140> would<00:02:30.260> really<00:02:30.410> need<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.950> my

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
you would really need to do in my

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.620 
you would really need to do in my
opinion<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:31.489> be<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> jailbreak<00:02:32.090> your<00:02:32.239> iphone

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
opinion would be a jailbreak your iphone

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.510 
opinion would be a jailbreak your iphone
and<00:02:32.870> they<00:02:33.050> may<00:02:33.440> actually<00:02:33.680> have<00:02:33.950> applications

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
and they may actually have applications

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.860 
and they may actually have applications
that<00:02:34.670> you'd<00:02:34.760> be<00:02:34.880> able<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.120> run<00:02:35.270> on<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.569> Apple

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that you'd be able to run on the Apple

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.440 
that you'd be able to run on the Apple
watch<00:02:36.050> through<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.920> iphone<00:02:37.459> again<00:02:38.120> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
watch through the iphone again that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.759 
watch through the iphone again that
Apple<00:02:38.900> watch<00:02:39.019> is<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.230> totally<00:02:39.530> different

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
Apple watch is a totally different

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.020 
Apple watch is a totally different
device<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.160> runs<00:02:40.280> totally<00:02:40.670> different<00:02:40.940> than

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
device that runs totally different than

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.759 
device that runs totally different than
the<00:02:41.569> iphone<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.110> we'll<00:02:42.230> have<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.440> wait<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.620> see

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
the iphone so we'll have to wait and see

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.650 
the iphone so we'll have to wait and see
but<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.220> think<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.730> would<00:02:43.790> be<00:02:43.880> very<00:02:44.120> cool<00:02:44.420> if

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
but I think that would be very cool if

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.120 
but I think that would be very cool if
you<00:02:44.989> could<00:02:45.110> jailbreak<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.650> watch<00:02:45.890> through

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
you could jailbreak that watch through

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.800 
you could jailbreak that watch through
the<00:02:46.160> iphone<00:02:46.550> give<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.390> ability<00:02:47.480> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the iphone give you the ability to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.650 
the iphone give you the ability to
actually<00:02:48.110> customize<00:02:48.709> different<00:02:49.160> things<00:02:49.340> like

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
actually customize different things like

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.309 
actually customize different things like
watch<00:02:50.660> faces<00:02:51.170> save<00:02:51.500> battery<00:02:53.050> install<00:02:54.050> other

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
watch faces save battery install other

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.440
