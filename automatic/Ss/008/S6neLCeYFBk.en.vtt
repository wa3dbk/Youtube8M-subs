00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
a little bit higher than that it's going

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.710 
a little bit higher than that it's going
to<00:02:42.640> give<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.820> little<00:02:42.970> bit<00:02:43.120> too<00:02:43.270> sensitive<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
to give a little bit too sensitive and

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.900 
to give a little bit too sensitive and
you're<00:02:43.930> going<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.110> risk<00:02:44.320> peaking<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.130> which<00:02:45.640> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
you're going to risk peaking it which I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.210 
you're going to risk peaking it which I
don't<00:02:45.970> want<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.900> usually<00:02:47.260> keep<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.650> at<00:02:47.770> 50<00:02:48.040> or

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
don't want so I usually keep it at 50 or

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.250 
don't want so I usually keep it at 50 or
below<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.760> used<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.270> actually<00:02:49.360> keep<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.780> at<00:02:49.900> 20

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
below I used to actually keep it at 20

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.410 
below I used to actually keep it at 20
but<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.740> would<00:02:51.160> find<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.580> had<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> raise<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
but I would find that I had to raise the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.900 
but I would find that I had to raise the
levels<00:02:52.720> after<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.560> post<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.700> would<00:02:54.790> just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
levels after in post and that would just

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.460 
levels after in post and that would just
give<00:02:55.030> me<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> lot<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.450> noise<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.900> now<00:02:55.930> putting<00:02:56.320> at

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
give me a lot of noise so now putting at

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.740 
give me a lot of noise so now putting at
50<00:02:56.770> seems<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.550> work<00:02:57.670> pretty<00:02:57.700> well<00:02:57.970> I'm<00:02:58.570> in<00:02:58.720> a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
50 seems to work pretty well I'm in a

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.810 
50 seems to work pretty well I'm in a
very<00:02:59.050> echoey<00:02:59.500> room<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.670> air

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
very echoey room and the air

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.670 
very echoey room and the air
conditioners<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.660> do<00:03:01.870> not<00:03:02.050> have<00:03:02.140> my<00:03:02.260> fan<00:03:02.500> on

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
conditioners on I do not have my fan on

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.140 
conditioners on I do not have my fan on
or<00:03:02.860> anything<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> fan<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.060> my

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
or anything like that but the fan to my

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.330 
or anything like that but the fan to my
computer<00:03:04.570> which<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.900> right<00:03:05.050> here<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.470> running

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
computer which is right here is running

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.830 
computer which is right here is running
so<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.790> don't<00:03:07.150> know<00:03:07.240> how<00:03:07.330> well<00:03:07.540> you're<00:03:07.690> going<00:03:07.720> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
so I don't know how well you're going to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.000 
so I don't know how well you're going to
be<00:03:07.930> able<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.080> hear<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.440> or<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.770> you're<00:03:08.890> going

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
be able to hear that or if you're going

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.740 
be able to hear that or if you're going
to<00:03:09.100> hear<00:03:09.250> any<00:03:09.400> noise<00:03:09.580> from<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.270> if<00:03:10.510> we

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
to hear any noise from that but if we

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.170 
to hear any noise from that but if we
switch<00:03:10.930> over<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> d7000<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.850> will<00:03:12.970> hear

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
switch over to the d7000 you will hear

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.970 
switch over to the d7000 you will hear
that<00:03:13.360> it's<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.600> huge<00:03:14.110> difference<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.800> it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
that it's a huge difference and it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.310 
that it's a huge difference and it
really<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.520> doesn't<00:03:15.760> compare<00:03:16.240> now<00:03:16.870> you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
really just doesn't compare now you

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.350 
really just doesn't compare now you
can't<00:03:17.560> use<00:03:17.650> an<00:03:17.890> onboard<00:03:18.370> microphone<00:03:18.910> for<00:03:19.150> good

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
can't use an onboard microphone for good

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.940 
can't use an onboard microphone for good
audio<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:19.989> doesn't<00:03:20.320> work<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.620> way

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
audio it just doesn't work that way

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.860 
audio it just doesn't work that way
so<00:03:21.130> getting<00:03:21.400> something<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> zoom<00:03:22.209> h1<00:03:22.420> is

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
so getting something like the zoom h1 is

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.600 
so getting something like the zoom h1 is
really<00:03:23.140> good<00:03:23.320> because<00:03:23.470> it's<00:03:24.100> really<00:03:24.459> small

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
really good because it's really small

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.790 
really good because it's really small
and<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.360> can<00:03:25.480> actually<00:03:25.630> attach<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.350> onto<00:03:26.680> the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
and you can actually attach it onto the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.590 
and you can actually attach it onto the
camera<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.030> take<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.269> with<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
camera and you can take that with you

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.330 
camera and you can take that with you
and<00:03:28.630> use<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.080> as<00:03:29.230> an<00:03:29.380> on-board<00:03:29.680> microphone<00:03:29.769> in

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
and use it as an on-board microphone in

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.220 
and use it as an on-board microphone in
a<00:03:30.370> way<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.180> now<00:03:31.330> switching<00:03:31.600> back<00:03:31.810> over<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.110> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
a way so now switching back over to the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.930 
a way so now switching back over to the
zoom<00:03:32.380> h1<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:33.010> hear<00:03:33.190> how<00:03:33.340> much<00:03:33.489> better<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
zoom h1 you can hear how much better the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.970 
zoom h1 you can hear how much better the
audio<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:35.019> really<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.440> makes<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.800> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
audio is and it really just makes it a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.860 
audio is and it really just makes it a
better<00:03:36.340> experience<00:03:36.790> especially<00:03:37.239> when<00:03:37.720> you

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
better experience especially when you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.690 
better experience especially when you
want<00:03:38.260> good<00:03:38.620> audio<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.250> right<00:03:39.400> now<00:03:39.489> I'm<00:03:39.610> going

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
want good audio so right now I'm going

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.040 
want good audio so right now I'm going
to<00:03:39.790> give<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.030> two<00:03:40.209> little<00:03:40.420> clips<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.900> I've

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
to give you two little clips that I've

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.080 
to give you two little clips that I've
made<00:03:41.290> one<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.680> my<00:03:41.769> car<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.340> one<00:03:42.580> at<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.880> beach

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
made one of my car and one at the beach

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.580 
made one of my car and one at the beach
so<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:43.810> showing<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.200> some<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.530> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
so this is just showing you some of the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.750 
so this is just showing you some of the
things<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.860> could<00:03:45.010> do<00:03:45.100> with<00:03:45.250> this<00:03:45.400> because

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
things you could do with this because

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.610 
things you could do with this because
it's<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.269> small<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:46.810> portable<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.440> could

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
it's so small and so portable you could

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.020 
it's so small and so portable you could
take<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.860> places<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.370> record<00:03:48.670> pretty<00:03:48.820> much

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
take it places and record pretty much

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.460 
take it places and record pretty much
anything<00:03:49.299> so<00:03:49.930> that's<00:03:50.049> where<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.290> going<00:03:50.410> to

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
anything so that's where you going to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.720 
anything so that's where you going to
hear<00:03:50.560> right<00:03:50.709> now<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.130> we'll<00:03:51.250> get<00:03:51.370> back<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
hear right now and we'll get back to the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:45.800 
hear right now and we'll get back to the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
this microphone what do I think about it

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.860 
this microphone what do I think about it
for<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.130> price<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.669> really<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.210> amazing<00:05:04.540> you

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870

I like about it well it is made out of

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.000 
I like about it well it is made out of

peeve thing is that eat through

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.620 
peeve thing is that eat through
batteries<00:05:42.220> really<00:05:42.699> quick<00:05:42.940> now<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.270> combat

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
batteries really quick now to combat

batteries really quick now to combat
that<00:05:43.810> I<00:05:43.870> just<00:05:44.169> bought<00:05:44.350> rechargeable

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
that I just bought rechargeable

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.500 
that I just bought rechargeable
batteries<00:05:45.460> which<00:05:45.729> is<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.030> thing<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.330> recommend

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
batteries which is the thing I recommend

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.300 
batteries which is the thing I recommend
but<00:05:47.199> if<00:05:47.260> you<00:05:47.440> don't<00:05:47.620> have<00:05:47.770> rechargeable

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
but if you don't have rechargeable

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.950 
but if you don't have rechargeable
batteries<00:05:48.669> expect<00:05:49.150> to<00:05:49.270> go<00:05:49.389> through<00:05:49.419> batteries

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
batteries expect to go through batteries

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.930 
batteries expect to go through batteries
very<00:05:50.020> fast<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.949> most<00:05:51.100> annoying<00:05:51.520> thing<00:05:51.850> I

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
very fast and the most annoying thing I

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.550 
very fast and the most annoying thing I
found<00:05:52.150> that<00:05:52.330> actually<00:05:52.690> causes<00:05:53.139> a<00:05:53.289> problem

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
found that actually causes a problem

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.740 
found that actually causes a problem
sometimes<00:05:53.949> for<00:05:54.370> me<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:55.120> buttons<00:05:55.419> aren't

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
sometimes for me is the buttons aren't

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.629 
sometimes for me is the buttons aren't
very<00:05:56.110> sensitive<00:05:56.710> you<00:05:56.919> really<00:05:57.280> have<00:05:57.400> to<00:05:57.520> make

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
very sensitive you really have to make

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.070 
very sensitive you really have to make
sure<00:05:57.820> that<00:05:57.850> you<00:05:58.090> click<00:05:58.300> them<00:05:58.479> otherwise<00:05:58.840> they

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
sure that you click them otherwise they

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.779 
sure that you click them otherwise they
might<00:05:59.289> not<00:05:59.530> respawn<00:05:59.919> and<00:06:00.310> there<00:06:00.639> has<00:06:00.760> been

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
might not respawn and there has been

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.190 
might not respawn and there has been
multiple<00:06:01.300> occasions<00:06:01.690> where<00:06:01.840> I've<00:06:01.930> clicked

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
multiple occasions where I've clicked

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.710 
multiple occasions where I've clicked
record<00:06:02.349> and<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:03.190> just<00:06:03.370> hasn't<00:06:03.639> recorded<00:06:04.300> now

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
record and it just hasn't recorded now

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.940 
record and it just hasn't recorded now
I'm<00:06:04.870> not<00:06:05.020> sure<00:06:05.139> if<00:06:05.229> I'm<00:06:05.380> doing<00:06:05.740> something

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
I'm not sure if I'm doing something

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.350 
I'm not sure if I'm doing something
wrong<00:06:06.220> but<00:06:06.460> I<00:06:06.520> shouldn't<00:06:06.880> have<00:06:06.970> to<00:06:07.150> think

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
wrong but I shouldn't have to think

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.670 
wrong but I shouldn't have to think
about<00:06:07.570> whether<00:06:07.750> or<00:06:07.930> not<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.110> pressed<00:06:08.500> it

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
about whether or not I pressed it

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.320 
about whether or not I pressed it
correctly<00:06:08.979> but<00:06:09.400> like<00:06:09.610> I<00:06:09.729> said<00:06:09.789> it's<00:06:10.240> really

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
correctly but like I said it's really

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.850 
correctly but like I said it's really
not<00:06:10.660> a<00:06:10.720> big<00:06:10.870> deal<00:06:10.930> just<00:06:11.380> something<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.740> have

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
not a big deal just something you have

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.560 
not a big deal just something you have
to<00:06:11.950> get<00:06:12.099> used<00:06:12.280> to<00:06:12.400> so<00:06:12.760> anyway<00:06:13.060> guys<00:06:13.210> for<00:06:13.539> a

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
to get used to so anyway guys for a

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.120 
to get used to so anyway guys for a
hundred<00:06:13.960> bucks<00:06:13.990> this<00:06:14.440> is<00:06:14.590> probably<00:06:14.919> one<00:06:15.099> of

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
hundred bucks this is probably one of

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.620 
hundred bucks this is probably one of
the<00:06:15.220> best<00:06:15.430> microphones<00:06:16.030> you<00:06:16.180> could<00:06:16.300> buy<00:06:16.419> out

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
the best microphones you could buy out

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.050 
the best microphones you could buy out
there<00:06:16.900> I<00:06:17.050> 100%<00:06:17.620> recommend<00:06:18.039> it<00:06:18.400> especially<00:06:18.520> if

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
there I 100% recommend it especially if

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.790 
there I 100% recommend it especially if
you<00:06:19.210> need<00:06:19.389> something<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:19.870> can<00:06:20.169> record<00:06:20.500> great

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
you need something that can record great

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.589 
you need something that can record great
audio<00:06:21.130> and<00:06:21.400> you're<00:06:21.490> always<00:06:21.760> on<00:06:22.060> the<00:06:22.150> go<00:06:22.300> it's

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
audio and you're always on the go it's

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.150 
audio and you're always on the go it's
great<00:06:22.840> because<00:06:23.020> it's<00:06:23.289> really<00:06:23.349> small<00:06:23.620> so<00:06:24.039> if

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
great because it's really small so if

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.860 
great because it's really small so if
you<00:06:24.280> have<00:06:24.400> a<00:06:24.430> small<00:06:24.760> desk<00:06:25.060> or<00:06:25.300> a<00:06:25.330> small<00:06:25.630> room
