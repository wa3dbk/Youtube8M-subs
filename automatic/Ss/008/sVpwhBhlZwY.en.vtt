00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.429
 once again on strong for you, and today 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.869
 Do you see my first appointment? 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.880
 about adlons warfare and yes i am 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.179
 especially in a private lobby as fast 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.210
 Alone we can see here 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.320
 and yes, we are going to look at the park today 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.090
 glitches on 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.850
 and yeah I am fine just a few we 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.820
 are currently on the mep solar and yes 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.949
 here there are the cool glitch so 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.859
 he comes here in the band and yes that 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.050
 I 'll tell you now 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.730
 I also watched it myself 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 after the German tutorial but that gave 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.030
 it is not or I happen to have 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.059
 found and I thought so close 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.780
 come when the whole amis and the 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.910
 heat and the whole klitschen fun 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.290
 I'll just do that in German and 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 yes, I just explain now step 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.040
 by step how that works and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.700
 then it could still do it if 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.740
 you want 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.420
 if you want to see more of it then 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.549
 Just let it be easier or write 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.020
 in the comments 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.750
 or do you have no abo there I am myself 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.200
 happy about mega and well of say 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.020
 Let's say 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.990
 So, as you can see, I am now on the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.340
 page sentinel disbon and run now 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.350
 just once long and that's here 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.180
 yes for such statements the squares 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.439
 are simply times 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.149
 and yes you just go there like that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.469
 I just have to look down 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.149
 I do not think so 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.530
 that you have to and then you just have to 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.520
 jump through it 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.590
 I 'm doing so job and if so 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.770
 you could double jump then yes 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.079
 if the circle presses, it is now included 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.590
 3 seriously injured , yes yes 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.630
 this 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.500
 knock down katja people afterwards 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.350
 a house connects the power 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.929
 So just double track and the punch 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.579
 and then just have to go against the wall 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.220
 The walkways had time you would have to 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.840
 if he does that, he did that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.080
 already seen if he does that now 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.890
 double jump and then right after the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.500
 double jump the beat with circle and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.480
 just to the right then you will notice 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.530
 mobile at once fixed but goes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:32.459
 just to the right then you can do so 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.489
 completing fine 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.680
 I mean you can not stay here 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.290
 waiting 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 but that is quite intelligent 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.650
 Built-up also asked the whole time 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.110
 and you do not hit me when I shoot like that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.420
 but not so close I meet the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.470
 earth so you see here the white one 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.209
 line 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.120
 this is the invisible line 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.680
 yes she is invisible and if you are there 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:04.329
 over it if he aimed over it he kill 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.370
 you do not do it then that he exactly 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.810
 like here 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:13.359
 there he meets nothing because you already meet 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.239
 that has to be exactly the same here as well 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:22.510
 you can not do that from here and here as well 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.769
 I could not do that here but yes 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.930
 that's just a small glacier 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.430
 not in the text without errors that comes 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.639
 just if he continues here to the rear 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.190
 But who goes here shows his data like 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:38.079
 it is with white but unfortunately I am 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.530
 So not at all yes if you like it 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.480
 I liked it then I would 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.190
 I'm happy as I said a rating 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 and I would say see you 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.160
 Just skin again in the next video 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.160
 pure until then
