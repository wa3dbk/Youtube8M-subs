00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
pomade pomade comes in two different

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.160 
pomade pomade comes in two different
forms<00:01:14.380> either<00:01:14.530> water<00:01:14.890> based<00:01:15.280> or<00:01:16.170> petroleum

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
forms either water based or petroleum

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.700 
forms either water based or petroleum
based<00:01:17.380> or<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:18.070> other<00:01:18.220> words<00:01:18.460> oil<00:01:18.820> based<00:01:19.710> water

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
based or in other words oil based water

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.760 
based or in other words oil based water
based<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.399> usually<00:01:22.149> easier<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:23.110> wash<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.679> to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
based is usually easier to wash it to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.200 
based is usually easier to wash it to
your<00:01:23.890> hair

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
your hair

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.340 
your hair
and<00:01:25.830> over<00:01:26.830> time<00:01:27.100> during<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.060> day<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.690> usually

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
and over time during the day it usually

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.190 
and over time during the day it usually
tends<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.800> harden<00:01:30.009> where<00:01:30.759> oil<00:01:31.119> base<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.750> harder

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
tends to harden where oil base is harder

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.620 
tends to harden where oil base is harder
to<00:01:32.320> get<00:01:32.590> out<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.770> your<00:01:32.830> hair<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.450> it'll<00:01:34.450> stay

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
to get out of your hair and it'll stay

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.740 
to get out of your hair and it'll stay
smoother<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.530> be<00:01:36.039> easily<00:01:36.670> comb<00:01:37.270> Bowl<00:01:37.539> during

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.050 
smoother and be easily comb Bowl during
the<00:01:37.960> day<00:01:38.140> now<00:01:38.530> American<00:01:39.190> Crew<00:01:39.369> pomade<00:01:39.819> is

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
the day now American Crew pomade is

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.570 
the day now American Crew pomade is
water-based<00:01:40.690> which<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.619> because<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:42.160> hate

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
water-based which I like because I hate

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.460 
water-based which I like because I hate
anything<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.330> takes<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.660> long<00:01:43.780> time<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.110> rinse

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
anything that takes a long time to rinse

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.300 
anything that takes a long time to rinse
out<00:01:44.679> of<00:01:44.770> your<00:01:44.860> hair<00:01:45.009> if<00:01:46.739> if<00:01:47.739> you<00:01:47.860> guys<00:01:48.009> have

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
really heavy wax it's really just a

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.690 
really heavy wax it's really just a
nuisance<00:01:55.959> to<00:01:56.229> wash<00:01:56.709> it<00:01:56.920> out<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.069> your<00:01:57.160> hair<00:01:57.369> so

nuisance to wash it out of your hair so
this<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.179> a<00:01:58.209> water-based<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.380> going<00:01:59.470> to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
this is a water-based and it's going to

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.130

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
like I said a water base usually tends

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.900
