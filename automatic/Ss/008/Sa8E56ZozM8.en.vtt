00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.790
 we are going to prepare an almond cake of 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.419
 chocolate for this we need a few 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.320
 yeast butter a little yeast 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.230
 chocolate sugar in this desserts and 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.660
 Ground almonds for coverage 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.070
 We will need liquid chocolate cream in 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.199
 this desserts and a little more than 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.150
 butter we'll start melting at 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.949
 bain marie or microwave chocolate 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.199
 with butter 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.480
 we need 150 grams chocolate nestle 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.440
 desserts we have a grammage 25 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.310
 grams each bar 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.920
 let's trace the chocolate 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.400
 we add the butter 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 and we will melt them 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.390
 we introduce it in the microwave and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 we schedule about two minutes two minutes 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 and a half to 700 once we have the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020
 melted chocolate we continue making 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.730
 the pie we are going to separate the yolks from 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.880
 the Clares 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.829
 and we will ride is clear to the point of snow 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.050
 let's add a pinch of salt so that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.329
 stay firm, we will mount them with 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 electric rods or manually but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.850
 it's much more practical if we have some 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 electric rods 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 the clear ones have to be firm but not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.720
 they must be as hard as for a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.410
 Meringue 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.660
 then we continue making the base 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 we add the sugar we continue beating 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.410
 until they whiten 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.400
 we add the chocolate 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.710
 and we continue beating a little more 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.130
 we incorporate the yeast 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.650
 and we went to work manually 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 we continue adding the ground almond 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.640
 we mix well 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.940
 little by little we incorporate the whites 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.740
 assembled 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.740
 the mounted whites have to be added 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.360
 slowly and if they have to go making 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.990
 enveloping movements so that 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.330
 lose the volume they have and the air 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.230
 this is perhaps the hardest part of 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.230
 the cake 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.550
 once we have the ready mass we are going to 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.290
 pour it into a mold the mold we have it 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.030
 previously greased with a little bit of 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.030
 butter and sprinkled with flour 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's bake it we introduce it in the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.040
 preheated oven and we will know about 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.930
 30 minutes at 180 degrees while 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.330
 we bake the cake we are going to prepare the 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.000
 coverage for it we have the cream 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.950
 boiling hot and we're going to add 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.950
 chocolate and butter 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.770
 and stir well until it melts 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.890
 we do this process for 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.910
 get an optimal temperature for 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.740
 the coverages 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.810
 so we get a lot of brightness and 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.590
 we get a coverage with the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.590
 perfect temperature 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.470
 the cooking time has elapsed 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 we can check if the cake is 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.150
 cooked by pinching it with a skewer of 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.500
 wood a wooden stick if it comes out 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.500
 dried that is cooked 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.130
 perfect 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.350
 and we continue once we have the cake 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.400
 we have disassembled it and we are going to 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.400
 cover it with coverage 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.190
 the chocolate that is left over we will pick it up and 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.350
 You can use for many other things 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.180
 it's a chocolate cream that you keep 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.010
 in a jar in the fridge and you can 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.780
 use as a cream anyone is 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.040
 important not to move the coverage of 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.260
 chocolate if we have much more 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.990
 bright and looks a lot more 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.490
 nice now we let it cool down to 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.430
 room temperature the temperature of 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.489
 he cooks for a few hours and he's 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.560
 list once we have the cold cake the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.600
 we serve decorating with some raspberries or 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.650
 what fruit you have 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.650
 to enjoy it
