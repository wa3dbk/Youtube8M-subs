hi<00:00:00.480> friends<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.260> Mohammad<00:00:01.680> Shaikh<00:00:01.829> in

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hi friends this is Mohammad Shaikh in

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.949 
hi friends this is Mohammad Shaikh in
here<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.790> tutorial<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.449> based<00:00:03.629> on

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
here and this tutorial is based on

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.650 
here and this tutorial is based on
creating<00:00:04.500> teardrop<00:00:05.040> which<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:05.970> coming<00:00:06.270> under

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
creating teardrop which is coming under

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.770 
creating teardrop which is coming under
the<00:00:06.930> flange<00:00:07.710> drop<00:00:08.010> down<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.910> walls

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
the flange drop down in the walls

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.870 
the flange drop down in the walls
toolbar<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.590> generative<00:00:11.429> sheet<00:00:11.610> but<00:00:11.759> we'll

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
toolbar in generative sheet but we'll

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.530 
toolbar in generative sheet but we'll
design<00:00:12.150> what<00:00:12.360> pencils<00:00:12.750> KCM<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.230> find<00:00:14.540> there

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
design what pencils KCM you find there

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.900 
design what pencils KCM you find there
are<00:00:15.570> two<00:00:15.660> ways<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.139> invoking<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.920> teardrop

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
are two ways of invoking the teardrop

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.540 
are two ways of invoking the teardrop
one<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> by<00:00:18.539> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> walls<00:00:19.230> tool<00:00:19.470> bar<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.920> we

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
one is by going to walls tool bar and we

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.849 
one is by going to walls tool bar and we
have<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.970> flange<00:00:21.359> drop<00:00:21.630> down<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:21.900> select

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
have the flange drop down here select

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.980 
have the flange drop down here select
the<00:00:23.100> third<00:00:23.279> option<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> teardrop<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the third option that is a teardrop and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
the third option that is a teardrop and
the<00:00:25.859> next<00:00:26.189> option<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> go<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.519> swept<00:00:29.519> walls

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the next option is to go all swept walls

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.730 
the next option is to go all swept walls
and<00:00:30.410> teardrop

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and teardrop

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.959 
and teardrop
so<00:00:32.399> teardrop<00:00:33.180> name<00:00:33.690> comes<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.890> shape<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
so teardrop name comes from the shape of

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
so teardrop name comes from the shape of
the<00:00:36.300> sheet<00:00:36.540> metal<00:00:36.690> component<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.980> gives<00:00:38.280> out

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the sheet metal component it gives out

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.569 
the sheet metal component it gives out
as<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> output<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.260> I'll<00:00:40.950> click<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
as the output so I'll click on the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
as the output so I'll click on the
teardrop<00:00:42.149> option<00:00:42.570> click<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.040> edge<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
teardrop option click on the edge so a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
teardrop option click on the edge so a
teardrop<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.039> similar<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> ham<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
teardrop is similar to a ham with the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
teardrop is similar to a ham with the
only<00:00:48.690> difference<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.559> flat<00:00:49.950> wall<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
only difference that if flat wall of the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.319 
only difference that if flat wall of the
teardrop<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.960> inlined<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.559> an<00:00:52.680> angle<00:00:56.329> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
teardrop will be inlined at an angle so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
teardrop will be inlined at an angle so
by<00:00:57.510> default<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.260> basic<00:00:58.620> option<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
by default the basic option is going to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.689 
by default the basic option is going to
be<00:00:59.940> selected<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.649> flange<00:01:01.949> drop-down<00:01:02.430> list

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
be selected in the flange drop-down list

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
be selected in the flange drop-down list
and<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> result<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> width<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and as a result the width of the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
and as a result the width of the
teardrop<00:01:05.519> feature<00:01:05.820> created<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.960> equal

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
teardrop feature created will be equal

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.030 
teardrop feature created will be equal
to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> width<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> selected<00:01:08.640> edge<00:01:10.040> I'll

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
to the width of the selected edge I'll

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760 
to the width of the selected edge I'll
be<00:01:11.369> explaining<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.600> work<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> limited

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
be explaining you to work on the limited

be explaining you to work on the limited
option<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> next<00:01:15.240> tutorial<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.650> have

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
option in the next tutorial and we have

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
option in the next tutorial and we have
couple<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> options<00:01:17.610> over<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> length

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
couple of options over here as a length

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
couple of options over here as a length
radius<00:01:19.470> spine<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:21.140> trim<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.619> length<00:01:23.460> option

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
radius spine and trim so length option

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.359 
radius spine and trim so length option
is<00:01:24.180> used<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.350> increase<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.040> decrease<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
is used to increase and decrease the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.179 
is used to increase and decrease the
length<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.990> looks<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.740> am<00:01:28.860> going

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
length so how it looks like I am going

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.600 
length so how it looks like I am going
to<00:01:29.340> show<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> from<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> side<00:01:30.090> view

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.640 

so<00:01:38.210> as<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.540> can<00:01:38.690> see<00:01:38.750> over<00:01:39.080> here<00:01:39.110> when<00:01:39.530> I

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
so as you can see over here when I

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.040 
so as you can see over here when I
increase<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.340> length

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
increase the length

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.560 
increase the length
you<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.830> see<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.640> particular<00:01:43.970> portion

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
you can see that this particular portion

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.980 
you can see that this particular portion
will<00:01:45.440> be<00:01:45.470> remained<00:01:46.130> attached<00:01:46.760> with<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.270> base

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
will be remained attached with the base

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.980 
will be remained attached with the base
wall<00:01:48.310> whereas<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.880> inclination<00:01:50.330> goes<00:01:50.750> on

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
wall whereas the inclination goes on

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.960 
wall whereas the inclination goes on
increasing<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.890> decreasing<00:01:52.070> when<00:01:52.670> I

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
increasing and decreasing when I

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.510 
increasing and decreasing when I
increase<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.510> decrease<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.990> length<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.680> you

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
increase and decrease the length and you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.580 
increase and decrease the length and you
have<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.940> radius<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.680> radius<00:01:58.100> also

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
have the radius and the radius also

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.650 
have the radius and the radius also
keeps<00:02:00.590> increasing<00:02:00.860> decreasing<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.450> can

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
keeps increasing decreasing so you can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.390 
keeps increasing decreasing so you can
specify<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.260> radius<00:02:03.560> according<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.280> your

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
specify the radius according to your

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.540 
specify the radius according to your
requirement<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.860> have<00:02:07.100> an<00:02:07.220> option

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
requirement and you have an option

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.400 
requirement and you have an option
called<00:02:07.730> as<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:08.119> propagate<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.960> option<00:02:09.290> is

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
called as a propagate this option is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.480 
called as a propagate this option is
used<00:02:09.680> to<00:02:09.890> select<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.330> tangential<00:02:12.020> edges<00:02:12.680> so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
used to select the tangential edges so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.280 
used to select the tangential edges so
if<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.760> don't<00:02:14.000> have<00:02:14.240> any<00:02:14.450> tangential<00:02:14.840> edges

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
if you don't have any tangential edges

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.890 
if you don't have any tangential edges
such<00:02:15.590> are<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.100> going<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.370> propagate<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.840> you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
such are not going to propagate so you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.170 
such are not going to propagate so you
have<00:02:18.410> an<00:02:18.560> option<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.890> trim<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.430> support<00:02:19.820> or
