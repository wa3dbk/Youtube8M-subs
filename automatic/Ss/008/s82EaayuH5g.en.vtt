00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.670
 well if you go to the game 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.070
 looks there are a tupac 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.139
 crucial moments have been quite a whole 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.019
 the first goal, of course, the keeper 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.020
 gibran yes yes yes and also injured 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.890
 off everything so wrong for such a boy 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.279
 can go and for us 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.650
 went wrong and then that moment roy 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.789
 coach with rob comes he goes flat 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.439
 sets the 2011 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.060
 so that was quite thick 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.519
 while I did find that gentleman himself 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.110
 pretty good football but there was 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.940
 another option to boom where that free 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.379
 kick against a moment because 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.149
 a goalkeeper who comes to a free ring 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.890
 kick the porridge what's the risk 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.960
 it just wasn't different 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 no the latter but nothing machine 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.809
 he the doctor 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.910
 viso indicated that he was no longer on it 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 could stand still yes 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.149
 Rule 1 is always that you never have to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.309
 exchange with Mrs standard situations 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.320
 you didn't normally have camp against that either 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.640
 went high again 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.670
 in the second half you stay alive 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.260
 thanks to kortsmit initially yes 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.370
 if i have had that idea then it is 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.629
 great course 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 I want to go back to the first evening 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.000
 I found us 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.770
 promising out of 100, even more lives up 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.370
 subscribe that their first half to one 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.170
 quite 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.400
 pretty good contender had the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.010
 best chances are not needed 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.650
 each other but joon or even and with no no 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.240
 and the two still with 2 0 as I am 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.440
 nature has happened 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 well then we have a revival 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.540
 top two there and then we were 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.220
 actually the competition was completely over 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.730
 balance force can with a very large one 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.130
 opportunity 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.780
 yes and also dangerous then 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.870
 because we took a lot of risks but yes that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.060
 could also make foscam so you know 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.050
 we have put everything in it 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.560
 and today we are going to have a few moments 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.930
 is not going to be crucial here 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.780
 did not have to plus within that dressing room 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.950
 is huge because we come from far and wide 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.080
 emotions naturally also increase 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 would logically have sports people in it 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.650
 I think an incredible beautiful 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 struggle to it was really one 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.090
 match that went out for both 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.980
 sides and unfortunately proc because short site 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 do you look back on you 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.850
 period so far at sparta well 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.590
 you know it's very heavy leftover 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360
 I have my last matches 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.440
 full focus maybe that we are 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.570
 a l 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.700
 I can do another quiet time 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.310
 is now full of emotion solid and the none 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.950
 We now want to consider a scratch because 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.510
 I too was concerned with my soul and salvation 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.740
 today is then 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.200
 why your change in the setup 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.220
 today what you get with miriam and more 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.750
 real defender versus short hand and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.700
 logical place until it was correct 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.510
 also much better and plus the fact 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.770
 that I also thought we were using magic and and 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.230
 made of wood 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.150
 often very dangerous by god so according to 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.170
 I was in pretty good shape 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.830
 do you go about trees days was every 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.150
 train once 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.040
 to do with disappointments here 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.510
 gets 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.670
 we just have not achieved promo 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.800
 for very far well then you go the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.350
 business prenezues evolve 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.420
 go long talk last time too 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.370
 done it with leo leg hacker 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.040
 about the new look for the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.270
 for the new season so those are the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.200
 things we need in the coming days 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.530
 going to do 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.530
 you're welcome
