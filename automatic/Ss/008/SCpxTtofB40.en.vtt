 8 speakers talking about 12 and going 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.350
 gradually increasing 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.450
 only that glasses categories that this is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 possible for anyone 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.309
 here begins this very serious practice 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 or severe and has to be much more as the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.199
 player are always two loudspeakers 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.719
 and three applicators of 100 thousand watts each 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.360
 one to play only speakers who do not 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.879

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.300
 ten thousand to complete the show the government 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.300

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:32.439
 is the leandro looking at our task 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.909
 already wanting to show this matter is 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.189
 the next because you do not need 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.590
 even a truck to have a big one 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.170
