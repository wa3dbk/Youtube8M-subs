canvas fight the GPU here is doing a
very<00:04:19.449> good<00:04:19.750> job

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:46.870 

and<00:04:38.919> it's<00:04:39.280> time<00:04:39.550> for<00:04:39.580> some<00:04:39.970> shooting

let's<00:04:47.600> see<00:04:47.750> how<00:04:47.870> well<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.230> does<00:04:48.440> at<00:04:49.000> subway

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
let's see how well it does at subway

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.170 
let's see how well it does at subway
surf<00:04:50.270> which<00:04:50.480> is<00:04:50.630> pretty<00:04:51.440> easy<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.280> not<00:04:52.700> so

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
surf which is pretty easy and not so

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.960 
surf which is pretty easy and not so
graphic<00:04:53.570> every<00:04:53.750> game<00:04:53.930> but<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.520> good<00:04:55.640> game

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
graphic every game but it is a good game

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.940 
graphic every game but it is a good game
to<00:04:56.180> test<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.990> touch<00:04:57.200> sensitivity<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
to test the touch sensitivity of the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.890 
to test the touch sensitivity of the
screen<00:04:58.220> how<00:04:58.640> will<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:58.970> responds<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.720> touch

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
screen how will it responds to the touch

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.640 
screen how will it responds to the touch
so<00:05:00.460> far<00:05:01.460> doing<00:05:01.850> highs<00:05:02.120> colors<00:05:03.080> are<00:05:03.260> coming<00:05:03.530> out

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
so far doing highs colors are coming out

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.160 
so far doing highs colors are coming out
to<00:05:03.800> be<00:05:03.920> nice<00:05:04.180> color<00:05:05.180> reproduction<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.930> fairly

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
to be nice color reproduction is fairly

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.380 
to be nice color reproduction is fairly
good<00:05:06.410> here<00:05:06.440> as<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.920> can<00:05:06.950> see<00:05:07.150> looks<00:05:08.150> very

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
good here as you can see looks very

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:31.860 
good here as you can see looks very
natural<00:05:08.570> nicely<00:05:09.530> saturated<00:05:10.130> color

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.969 

so<00:05:32.870> we<00:05:32.990> had<00:05:33.139> a<00:05:33.169> pretty<00:05:33.409> good<00:05:33.560> gaming

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
so we had a pretty good gaming

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.260 
so we had a pretty good gaming
experience<00:05:34.490> with<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.729> micromax<00:05:35.150> canvas

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
experience with the micromax canvas

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.879 
experience with the micromax canvas
night<00:05:35.629> let<00:05:35.930> me<00:05:36.050> quickly<00:05:36.259> show<00:05:36.439> you<00:05:36.620> the

the test again after our first test and

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.950 
the test again after our first test and
we<00:05:41.930> got<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.110> score<00:05:42.409> of<00:05:42.560> 20<00:05:43.210> 9940<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:44.840> is

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
we got a score of 20 9940 to this is

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.450 
we got a score of 20 9940 to this is
higher<00:05:45.169> than<00:05:45.469> what<00:05:45.710> we<00:05:45.860> got<00:05:46.039> on<00:05:46.069> the<00:05:46.279> first

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
time it was 25,000 something maybe we

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.559 
time it was 25,000 something maybe we
were<00:05:49.279> running<00:05:49.460> low<00:05:49.699> on<00:05:49.729> battery<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.419> there

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
were running low on battery and there

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.510 
were running low on battery and there
was<00:05:50.779> some<00:05:51.110> load<00:05:51.499> on<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.800> background<00:05:52.069> with

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
which it was not performing as well but

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.689 
which it was not performing as well but
we<00:05:56.360> got<00:05:56.389> a<00:05:56.539> score<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.020> 20<00:05:57.400> 9900<00:05:58.400> which<00:05:58.550> is

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
we got a score of 20 9900 which is

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.450 
we got a score of 20 9900 which is
higher<00:05:59.330> than<00:05:59.719> the<00:05:59.930> samsung<00:06:00.319> galaxy<00:06:00.710> s4<00:06:01.189> here

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460

as<00:06:02.029> you<00:06:02.270> can<00:06:02.419> see<00:06:02.629> and<00:06:02.810> it<00:06:03.409> scores<00:06:03.770> higher<00:06:04.099> in

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
as you can see and it scores higher in

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
etc so this is about the antutu and let

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.980 
etc so this is about the antutu and let
