00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
last I think I'll start with the worst
and<00:01:37.170> hardest<00:01:37.649> sniper<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> gold<00:01:38.990> which

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

like<00:02:02.670> they're<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:04.380> wouldn't<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.800> one-shot

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
like they're that wouldn't be a one-shot

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.040 
like they're that wouldn't be a one-shot
kill<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.970> then<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:06.600> shot<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.900> in<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
kill but then if you shot them in the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.230 
kill but then if you shot them in the
head<00:02:07.110> afterwards<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.759> still<00:02:09.000> got<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
head afterwards and still got that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.180 
head afterwards and still got that
headshot<00:02:09.509> because<00:02:10.440> obviously<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.920> hit<00:02:11.100> them

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
headshot because obviously you hit them

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
headshot because obviously you hit them
with<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:11.970> below<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.450> still<00:02:12.690> wouldn't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
with that one below that still wouldn't

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.410 
with that one below that still wouldn't
count<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.320> one<00:02:13.530> shot<00:02:13.710> kill<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:15.120> get<00:02:15.270> those

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
count as a one shot kill so to get those

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.900 
count as a one shot kill so to get those
250<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.410> shot<00:02:16.680> kills<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.160> start<00:02:17.520> off<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
250 one shot kills to start off the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.530 
250 one shot kills to start off the
camos<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.440> easy<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> SVU<00:02:23.540> but

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
camos it's not easy with the SVU but

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420 
camos it's not easy with the SVU but
yeah<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.650> darling<00:02:25.830> Callum<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.310> this

I believe yeah the first one was the DSR
the<00:02:55.440> second<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:55.980> was<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.700> third<00:02:56.940> was

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
but yep this is what this looks like the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.830 
but yep this is what this looks like the
only<00:03:05.040> thing<00:03:05.130> I'm<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.550> too<00:03:05.700> keen<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.300> on<00:03:06.720> the

only thing I'm not too keen on is on the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
only thing I'm not too keen on is on the
scope<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.410> big<00:03:07.560> black<00:03:07.800> bit<00:03:08.040> hanging<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.459> at

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
scope the big black bit hanging out at

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.759 
scope the big black bit hanging out at
the<00:03:09.090> left<00:03:09.390> side<00:03:09.480> obviously<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> thing<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.620> top

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.830 
the left side obviously the thing on top
is<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> ballistics<00:03:11.519> cpu<00:03:11.640> attachment<00:03:12.600> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
is the ballistics cpu attachment to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.300 
is the ballistics cpu attachment to
reduce<00:03:13.290> why<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:16.230> yeah<00:03:16.380> let's<00:03:16.590> move<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.740

hit there haha but yeah the thing that I

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.560 
hit there haha but yeah the thing that I
like<00:03:37.709> about<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.040> ballista<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.209> actual

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
like about the ballista is the actual

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.540 
like about the ballista is the actual
bolt<00:03:39.930> at<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.410> side<00:03:40.620> look<00:03:40.920> if<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.100> shoot<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
bolt at the side look if I shoot it and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.340 
bolt at the side look if I shoot it and
then<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.730> pause<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.060> falling<00:03:42.360> back<00:03:42.510> back<00:03:43.170> and

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
then you pause it falling back back and

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.860 
then you pause it falling back back and
forward<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:44.250> bolt<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.670> all<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.150> diamond<00:03:45.810> D

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
forward the bolt is all like diamond D

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.060 
forward the bolt is all like diamond D
and<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.019> think<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.350> looks<00:03:46.440> really<00:03:46.680> awesome

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070

diagonally down to the left from the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.229 
diagonally down to the left from the
actual<00:03:52.019> scope<00:03:52.380> itself<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:53.070> olives<00:03:53.370> bowls<00:03:56.239> next
