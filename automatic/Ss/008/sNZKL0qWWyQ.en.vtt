just look at a potential anchor site and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.529 
just look at a potential anchor site and
ask<00:02:01.500> yourself<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.580> hold<00:02:02.789> me<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
ask yourself will that hold me you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.540 
ask yourself will that hold me you
really<00:02:03.899> need<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.080> ask<00:02:04.289> yourself<00:02:04.470> will<00:02:05.399> this

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
really need to ask yourself will this

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.059 
really need to ask yourself will this
anchor<00:02:05.940> point<00:02:06.149> oh<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.569> truck<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.950> the
