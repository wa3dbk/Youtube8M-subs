00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
gyro arm rest and that is what I molded

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.210 
gyro arm rest and that is what I molded
this<00:03:36.550> one<00:03:36.790> from<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.420> took<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:38.260> only<00:03:38.560> since<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.100> only

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
this one from I took I only since I only

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.010 
this one from I took I only since I only
had<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.700> passenger<00:03:40.240> side<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.630> had<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.930> make

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
had the passenger side and I had to make

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.860 
had the passenger side and I had to make
a<00:03:41.080> driver's<00:03:41.590> side<00:03:41.800> I<00:03:42.130> took<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.180> block<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.660> foam

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
a driver's side I took a block of foam

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.160 
a driver's side I took a block of foam
and<00:03:44.140> carved<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.190> exactly<00:03:48.360> it's<00:03:49.360> exactly<00:03:49.960> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
and carved it exactly it's exactly the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.600 
and carved it exactly it's exactly the
same<00:03:50.410> size

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.710 

it<00:03:54.330> fits<00:03:54.660> exactly<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.440> same<00:03:55.680> as<00:03:55.860> an<00:03:55.980> oem<00:03:59.720> so

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
it fits exactly the same as an oem so

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.420 
it fits exactly the same as an oem so
when<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.140> wrap<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.770> leather<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.220> just

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
when you wrap this with leather you just

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.010 
when you wrap this with leather you just
bring<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.760> leather<00:04:02.970> right<00:04:03.240> down<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.720> end<00:04:03.900> it

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
bring the leather right down and end it

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.900 
bring the leather right down and end it
in<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.290> corner<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.920> then<00:04:05.550> this<00:04:05.670> will

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
in that corner and then this will

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.140 
in that corner and then this will
actually<00:04:06.500> squish<00:04:07.700> on<00:04:08.810> both<00:04:09.810> sides<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:11.850> it

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
actually squish on both sides so that it

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.820 
actually squish on both sides so that it
can<00:04:12.270> be<00:04:12.390> pushed<00:04:12.630> all<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.870> way<00:04:12.990> into<00:04:13.260> seat<00:04:13.710> at

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
can be pushed all the way into seat at

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.860 
can be pushed all the way into seat at
the<00:04:13.920> back<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.850> same<00:04:15.090> thing<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.570> drill

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
the back and the same thing you drill

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.170 
the back and the same thing you drill
holes<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.500> run<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> screw<00:04:17.700> through<00:04:17.730> into<00:04:18.150> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
holes here run a screw through into a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.060 
holes here run a screw through into a
speed<00:04:18.540> nut<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.170> holds<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.560> secure<00:04:19.980> in

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
speed nut and that holds it secure in

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.590 
speed nut and that holds it secure in
place<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:21.510> that's<00:04:21.720> pretty<00:04:21.959> much<00:04:22.049> how<00:04:22.410> that

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
place so that's pretty much how that

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.540 
place so that's pretty much how that
that<00:04:24.600> looks<00:04:24.900> when<00:04:25.140> it's<00:04:25.170> done<00:04:25.500> there's<00:04:26.340> room

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
that looks when it's done there's room

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.150 
that looks when it's done there's room
for<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.850> tweeter<00:04:27.530> everything<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.980> way<00:04:29.010> it

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
for the tweeter everything is the way it

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.350 
for the tweeter everything is the way it
should<00:04:29.280> be<00:04:31.580> these<00:04:32.580> are<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.880> molds<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.330> a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
should be these are the molds this is a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.430 
should be these are the molds this is a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
to maybe aid in three pieces I see a lot

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.250 
to maybe aid in three pieces I see a lot
of<00:04:59.640> other<00:04:59.850> people<00:05:00.000> try<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.570> do<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.080> they

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
of other people try and do it and they

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.409 
of other people try and do it and they
try<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.560> make<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.070> armrest<00:05:02.550> into<00:05:02.910> pieces<00:05:03.180> and

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
try and make the armrest into pieces and

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.840 
try and make the armrest into pieces and
then<00:05:03.690> glass<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.260> all<00:05:04.380> together<00:05:04.560> once<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.669> comes

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
then glass it all together once it comes

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.400 
then glass it all together once it comes
out<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.270> mold<00:05:06.479> it's<00:05:06.780> easier<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.229> make<00:05:07.380> a

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
out of the mold it's easier to make a

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.469 
out of the mold it's easier to make a
mold<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.890> separates<00:05:08.580> three<00:05:08.970> different<00:05:09.300> ways

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
mold that separates three different ways

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.140 
mold that separates three different ways
so<00:05:09.870> there's<00:05:10.770> no<00:05:10.950> there's<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.400> lot<00:05:11.640> of<00:05:11.669> negative

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
so there's no there's a lot of negative

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.480 
so there's no there's a lot of negative
reliefs<00:05:12.479> on<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> on<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.110> piece<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:14.340> is

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
reliefs on the on the piece and this is

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.050 
reliefs on the on the piece and this is
the<00:05:14.610> easiest<00:05:14.940> way<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.240> do<00:05:15.450> it<00:05:15.600> so<00:05:16.850> this<00:05:17.850> is<00:05:17.880> the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the easiest way to do it so this is the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
the easiest way to do it so this is the
door<00:05:18.360> card<00:05:19.010> it's<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.220> molds<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:21.720> finished

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
door card it's the molds the finished

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.460 
door card it's the molds the finished
piece<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:23.669> like<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:23.940> say<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.900> can<00:05:25.080> line<00:05:25.290> this

line up the same everything is identical

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.650 
line up the same everything is identical
I<00:05:34.010> know<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.160> lot<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.430> people<00:05:35.580> were<00:05:35.970> looking<00:05:36.150> for
