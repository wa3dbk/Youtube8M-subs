00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the line if you click on the line and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.219 
the line if you click on the line and
you<00:01:02.909> click<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.269> on<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.749> keyboard

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you click I on your keyboard

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690 
you click I on your keyboard
it'll<00:01:04.470> invert<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> line<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> can

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it'll invert the line and you can

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.280 
it'll invert the line and you can
actually<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:06.630> part<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> line<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
actually see which part of the line you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.670 
actually see which part of the line you
write<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.600> already<00:01:10.110> tell<00:01:10.230> though

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
write on you can already tell though

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.980 
write on you can already tell though
because<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.190> this<00:01:11.340> blue<00:01:11.700> shaded<00:01:12.060> side<00:01:12.480> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
because it's this blue shaded side the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.900 
because it's this blue shaded side the
rest<00:01:13.230> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.620> line<00:01:13.800> is<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.430> looks<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
rest of the line is just for looks and

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.930 
rest of the line is just for looks and
it<00:01:15.120> does<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.680> impact<00:01:16.680> where<00:01:17.190> your<00:01:17.400> bike<00:01:17.610> rides

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
it does not impact where your bike rides

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.540 
it does not impact where your bike rides
so<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.480> example<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.770> will<00:01:19.980> work<00:01:20.190> just<00:01:20.220> fine

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
so for example this will work just fine

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.870 
so for example this will work just fine
and<00:01:21.060> it'll<00:01:21.540> ride<00:01:21.870> on<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> blue<00:01:23.490> part<00:01:23.730> of<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and it'll ride on the blue part of the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.800 
and it'll ride on the blue part of the
line<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.660> maroon<00:01:25.200> part<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:26.150> I<00:01:27.150> invert<00:01:27.660> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
line not the maroon part if I invert the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
line not the maroon part if I invert the
line<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.200> you'll<00:01:28.440> see<00:01:28.760> still<00:01:29.760> rides<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.120> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
line now you'll see still rides on the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.500 
line now you'll see still rides on the
blue<00:01:30.300> part<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> line<00:01:35.030> next<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.240> when<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
blue part of the line next is when you

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.160 
blue part of the line next is when you
connect<00:01:36.840> lines<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.490> just<00:01:38.490> pressed<00:01:39.300> L<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
connect lines I just pressed L to go to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.440 
connect lines I just pressed L to go to
the<00:01:40.260> line<00:01:40.440> if<00:01:40.620> I<00:01:41.370> try<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.640> create<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.970> line<00:01:42.210> from

the line if I try to create a line from

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
the line if I try to create a line from
right<00:01:42.510> here<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.440> sure<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.130> zoom<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
right here make sure that you zoom in

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.060 
right here make sure that you zoom in
enough<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.300> you<00:01:46.050> get<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.410> beginning<00:01:46.560> point

radius so click where your two points

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.080 
radius so click where your two points
connect<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:26.129> can<00:02:26.280> create<00:02:26.519> your<00:02:26.610> radius<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
connect you can create your radius this

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.210 
connect you can create your radius this
way<00:02:27.920> click<00:02:28.920> again<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.400> end<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.640> radius<00:02:30.000> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
way click again to end the radius and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.270 
way click again to end the radius and
you<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.400> do<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:33.090> both<00:02:33.920> inside<00:02:34.920> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
you can do this for both inside and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.400 
you can do this for both inside and
outside<00:02:36.000> lines

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.190 

so<00:02:40.410> here's<00:02:40.709> an<00:02:40.860> outsize<00:02:41.360> radius<00:02:45.019> here's<00:02:46.019> an

so here's an outsize radius here's an

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.229 
so here's an outsize radius here's an
outside<00:02:46.650> radius<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.370> actually<00:02:47.940> creates

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
outside radius and this actually creates

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.350 
outside radius and this actually creates
a<00:02:48.329> very<00:02:48.540> good<00:02:48.720> example<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:50.549> an<00:02:50.819> internal

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
a very good example and then an internal

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.479 
a very good example and then an internal

radius sometimes when you create the
radii<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> line<00:02:54.930> will<00:02:55.200> invert

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
radii like that the line will invert

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.000 
radii like that the line will invert

to<00:04:00.450> line<00:04:00.660> up<00:04:00.870> as<00:04:01.609> well<00:04:02.609> as<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.910> can<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.359> lot<00:04:03.569> of

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
to line up as well as you can a lot of

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.780 
to line up as well as you can a lot of
the<00:04:03.720> times<00:04:03.959> they'll<00:04:04.260> actually<00:04:04.500> snap<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.400> when

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
the times they'll actually snap in when

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.220 
the times they'll actually snap in when
they<00:04:05.910> get<00:04:06.060> close<00:04:06.269> enough<00:04:06.450> like<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.930> see<00:04:07.200> that

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
they get close enough like you see that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.830 
they get close enough like you see that
one<00:04:07.560> moves<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:08.010> lot<00:04:08.879> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> time<00:04:09.239> it's<00:04:09.569> smart

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
one moves a lot of the time it's smart

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.180 
one moves a lot of the time it's smart
enough<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:10.049> do<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.260> by<00:04:10.349> itself

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.600 

all<00:04:14.190> right<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.400> this

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
all right so this

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.039 
all right so this
Bart<00:04:14.910> isn't<00:04:15.150> very<00:04:15.270> important<00:04:15.690> but<00:04:15.810> just<00:04:15.960> so

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
Bart isn't very important but just so

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.569 
Bart isn't very important but just so
you<00:04:16.109> know<00:04:16.320> when<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.709> make<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.890> circle<00:04:17.430> or<00:04:17.549> a

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
you know when you make a circle or a

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.840 
you know when you make a circle or a
line<00:04:17.820> say<00:04:18.450> for<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.660> circle<00:04:18.989> first<00:04:19.760> once<00:04:20.760> you

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
line say for a circle first once you

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.460 
line say for a circle first once you
started<00:04:21.090> creating<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.570> radius<00:04:21.900> if<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.350> go

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
started creating the radius if you go

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.440 
started creating the radius if you go
clockwise<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.730> line<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.210> on<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
clockwise the line is going to be on the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.430 
clockwise the line is going to be on the
inside<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:25.490> if<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.610> go<00:04:27.440> counterclockwise

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
inside and if you go counterclockwise

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.040 
inside and if you go counterclockwise
it's<00:04:29.160> going<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.730> be<00:04:29.850> on<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> outside<00:04:30.150> either

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
it's going to be on the outside either

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.990 
it's going to be on the outside either
way<00:04:31.470> like<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.860> said<00:04:32.040> before<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.520> doesn't<00:04:32.700> really

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
way like I said before it doesn't really

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.430 
way like I said before it doesn't really
matter<00:04:33.270> because<00:04:33.450> your<00:04:33.690> bike<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.020> only<00:04:34.200> going

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440

out of line segments so you can see this

levels<00:07:39.270> and<00:07:39.450> uploading<00:07:39.870> them<00:07:39.900> to<00:07:40.020> by<00:07:40.410> crease

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710 
levels and uploading them to by crease

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.840 
levels and uploading them to by crease
levels<00:07:41.070> calm<00:07:41.550> thanks<00:07:42.419> for<00:07:42.539> watching
