00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.240 
is going to put a value on the nutrition
as<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.409> whole<00:03:25.620> which<00:03:25.799> we<00:03:25.919> kind<00:03:26.099> of<00:03:26.129> already

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
as a whole which we kind of already

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.939 
as a whole which we kind of already
discuss<00:03:26.639> is<00:03:26.819> not<00:03:27.810> only<00:03:28.079> our<00:03:28.199> carbs<00:03:28.530> fats<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
discuss is not only our carbs fats and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.379 
discuss is not only our carbs fats and
protein<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.579> micro<00:03:29.849> nutrients<00:03:30.180> and

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
protein but as our micro nutrients and

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.000 
protein but as our micro nutrients and
vitamins<00:03:30.449> so<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.319> think<00:03:31.379> a<00:03:31.500> lot<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.650> people<00:03:31.889> go

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
vitamins so I think a lot of people go

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.559 
vitamins so I think a lot of people go
wrong<00:03:32.310> by<00:03:32.489> viewing<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:32.909> because<00:03:33.120> they<00:03:33.239> fix<00:03:33.449> it

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
wrong by viewing it because they fix it

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.030 
wrong by viewing it because they fix it
on<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.689> foods<00:03:33.959> not<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.470> nutrients<00:03:34.889> within

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
on the foods not the nutrients within

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.379 
on the foods not the nutrients within
the<00:03:35.159> foods<00:03:35.400> because<00:03:35.609> that's<00:03:35.790> ultimately<00:03:35.970> what

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
the foods because that's ultimately what

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.000 
the foods because that's ultimately what
we<00:03:36.449> want<00:03:36.689> because<00:03:37.079> what's<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.409> value<00:03:37.650> what<00:03:37.949> do

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
we want because what's the value what do

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.770 
we want because what's the value what do
you<00:03:38.099> look<00:03:38.280> at<00:03:38.430> when<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:39.030> look<00:03:39.269> at<00:03:39.479> a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
you look at when you look at a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.939 
you look at when you look at a
particular<00:03:40.109> food<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.560> look<00:03:40.769> at<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
particular food you look at the

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.409 
particular food you look at the
nutritional<00:03:41.489> label<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.879> look<00:03:42.060> at<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
nutritional label you look at the

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.210 
nutritional label you look at the
nutrition<00:03:43.199> within<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> food<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:43.919> that's<00:03:44.069> kind

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
nutrition within the food so that's kind

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.309 
nutrition within the food so that's kind
of<00:03:44.250> my<00:03:44.340> point<00:03:44.370> there<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.479> then<00:03:45.780> another<00:03:45.989> thing

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
of my point there and then another thing

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.920 
of my point there and then another thing
with<00:03:46.859> flexible<00:03:47.489> dieting<00:03:47.729> or<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.509> it<00:03:48.629> fits<00:03:48.810> your

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
with flexible dieting or if it fits your

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.449 
with flexible dieting or if it fits your
macros<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.829> think<00:03:50.069> we're<00:03:50.189> a<00:03:50.220> lot<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
macros that I think we're a lot of

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.800 
macros that I think we're a lot of
people<00:03:50.669> go<00:03:50.790> wrong<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.509> people

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
people go wrong and this is the people

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.409 
people go wrong and this is the people
who<00:03:51.900> implement<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.769> people<00:03:53.489> use<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.060> and

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
who implement it is people use it and

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.819 
who implement it is people use it and
abuse<00:03:54.509> it<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.049> give<00:03:55.169> it<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.290> bad<00:03:55.439> name<00:03:55.680> because

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
abuse it and give it a bad name because

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.920 
abuse it and give it a bad name because
they<00:03:56.159> almost<00:03:56.310> use<00:03:56.579> it<00:03:56.729> as<00:03:56.849> an<00:03:57.150> excuse<00:03:57.599> or<00:03:57.810> as<00:03:57.900> a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
they almost use it as an excuse or as a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.899 
they almost use it as an excuse or as a
scapegoat<00:03:58.229> you<00:03:58.979> know<00:03:59.099> they'll<00:03:59.370> post<00:03:59.609> pictures

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909
