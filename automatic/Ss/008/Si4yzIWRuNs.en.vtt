00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:13.600
 Oh, oh, I took it fast and caught up with the latest technologies in Japan 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.600
 Earth Seku' to the plate under decipher tomorrow's economy from there 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.759
 The first newcomer is Yoichi Ito, a familiar economic analyst 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.130
 And a sister of technology love fraud 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:30.070
 Anna Ao Rena gar 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 Today, the world looks at the display technology that anticipates the future and spins out of it 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 Approaching advanced technology 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.989
 2 is now set to start o 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:01:04.230
 Buba is a liquid crystal display Day Watch et al.'S no example of this is the ne e-book dinosaur erotic 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:07.680
 That's Satoko 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.850
 It doesn't evolve from year to year, is n't it great? 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 And so here is Chiba University researching the Mira Display that has evolved into a server 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.510
 It seems that there is a laboratory 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.570
 Furthermore it is spring win or this is counterfeit it 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.570
 We declare in the world of center doser today 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:32.730
 Chiba University visited by 3 people 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:39.650
 First Visited Wow Oze Chie 's Lab's Office 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.650
 It is usually expected that the liquid crystal that is contained in this is beat by phone mail to generate power 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:53.750
 By I use the role corresponding to say it Ako Buber was the children of Hama is to Buber taking the tee expectations 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:58.440
 Do you enjoy yourself 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:03.650
 In fact, when you look at it with a microscope, it's a tiny tick. 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:08.030
 It is important to note that this liquid remains liquid 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:14.220
 Such 13 distress Is that trapped 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:17.690
 If you fall in love with a really strong force, the liquid will come out of the inside a 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.690
 Naa likely Datte some of the eggs 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:40.390
 NiÃ±o twitter Te Buber 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:47.110
 Mix the flour in it you think you can bet Well Pinky 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.880
 Then the light red when I'll put a sweat in the example destruction Hey made at the layout 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.720
 There also 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 How does the liquid crystal in a microcapsule move? 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.800
 It is still a problem with a little bit of simple experiment in the cause of the operation to try to check in the experiment 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 But also 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.670
 Try to touch a building little Pochira to the electrode 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.670
 Yes 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.040
 Let's see people 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.069
 so 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.269
 It will light the Tsuitaa no force Bears in a small microcapsules by intoxicated key 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.670
 Went into 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:28.090
 The primary molecule of the liquid is moving, so it won't let the 8 lights pass 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.599
 Is this going to make videos possible? 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.220
 Who What is needed is flowing again this kind of touch Chichibu minutes 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.630
 It is also very important to say how much transparency is good in the class of electrode materials. 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.520
 It is limited 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:51.350
 It is usually difficult to use itot-friendly material, and if you are asked to bend it a lot 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:04:04.680
 Can Thin-film transistor called to try to control one by one month from Patti 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:06.600
 If there is no one that Buba to have Tim introduction to this 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.940
 Yes that song Bern 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:17.310
 Thing likely beautiful video yet can color in Hao display Yes 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.450
 Say not in the dream is also possible that in the future save that kind of moving a little more fine guard 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.720
 I think so 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:28.200
 Liquid crystal which is more stable than organic el 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.280
 Bending transistor to bending transparent electrode 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:36.950
 You can play the video in the future by further refinement 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.950
 You may be able to make a bent LCD 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.639
 Yoichiro Ito tomorrow Teku compass 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:53.780
 I It Is It is a tan even think of the deceased 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:58.580
 Today has been a very looking forward to seeing you and the people of image science department of Chiba University 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:04.639
 Though it it's my uncle is the sputum working for Fuji film 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.630
 I chose the university of origin as Chiba University, but I am considerably older than me 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.240
 I why I went Chiba University 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.960
 If you ask me, only at National University 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:18.360
 I said that there was a photography department 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.020
 It is I image Science is when I heard the story today 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.520
 The photography department 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:29.030
 I heard that it has been canceled and developed into the current department 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.529
 It is now from this I that is display 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:37.299
 It will not be how to develop today 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:39.040
 The global display market will continue to grow 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:42.120
 It is in theory 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:47.490
 There is also a prospect that it will be 10 trillion yen 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:53.160
 The display is of crucial importance to the future industrial activities 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.510
 Moreover, the display seems to be various things in the refrigerator in various places 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.050
 I will follow you 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:02.139
 The microwave oven is also about that kind of thing 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:05.860
 What do to the way of the future what kind of development 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:10.840
 Today's topic was whether something with functionality came out 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.700
 Though book is suspicious in the field of devices today 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.530
 New display 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.790
 Bending displays Various displays If you develop any time strike 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.150
 I can bag 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.150
 I thought that the technology of this university would live there 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.700
 Now I today Yes 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:35.420
 I can not help it-follow how to evolve 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:40.700
 How it was not I'd think the story, or rather become what form future 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:45.670
 So yes I I thought I mobile phone you are using a little Well now I Is not me to use even even if you 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:49.960
 After all I thought it would be nice if I could use my mobile phone more publicly than noon 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:54.760
 I like micro-tapping That same kind of liquid crystal hatome love 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:59.370
 I think that strange feeling that I have to play that I think already white I received an explanation 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.370
 It would have been like you hadn't been there . 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:18.120
 A woman who is inferior to Buber 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:22.320
 Can you display ah ah ah one nude point 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:27.990
 By what kind of large growing patient group 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.560
 That's right I felt that kind of anxiety I stripped it next week in the world of cutting-edge technology 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.560
 Let's meet 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500
 haha
