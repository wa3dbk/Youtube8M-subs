00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
IP will be in the description and it's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.980 
IP will be in the description and it's
right<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.130> screen<00:00:17.340> right<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:17.990> so

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
right here on the screen right now so

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.340 
right here on the screen right now so
it's<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:20.189> service<00:00:20.460> cord<00:00:20.670> Helle<00:00:20.880> crafts<00:00:21.350> so

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's the service cord Helle crafts so

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.259 
it's the service cord Helle crafts so
let's<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.680> join<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.279> make<00:00:23.730> sure<00:00:23.760> you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
let's just join that and make sure you

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.670 
let's just join that and make sure you
add<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.570> port<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> end<00:00:25.710> because

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
add that port in at the end because

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.400 
add that port in at the end because
usually<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.220> 55<00:00:29.609> 65<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.779> it's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
usually it's to 55 65 but this one it's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.610 
usually it's to 55 65 but this one it's
to<00:00:31.679> 55<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.579> 56<00:00:33.149> 69<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> add<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to 55 to 56 69 so you have to add that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.490 
to 55 to 56 69 so you have to add that
at<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> end<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.840> copy<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
at the end so just copy it from the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.860 
at the end so just copy it from the
description<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.100> paste<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.870> so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
description and paste it in here so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.190 
description and paste it in here so
let's<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.140> join<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> server<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> just

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
let's just join the server and you just

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
let's just join the server and you just
need<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> login<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.160> guys<00:00:44.370> even<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.850> my

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
need a login I know you guys even see my

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.369 
need a login I know you guys even see my

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so there we go now this server has no

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.479 
so there we go now this server has no
lag<00:00:53.210> usually<00:00:54.210> there's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> people<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.739> I

have been asking me how do you register
it's<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.210> hard<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.780> need<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> read

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it's not that hard you just need to read

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.640 
it's not that hard you just need to read
the<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.619> bottom<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.150> who<00:01:18.630> asked<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> type
