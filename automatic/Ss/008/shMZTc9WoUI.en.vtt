 It means that it will be a so-called volcanic eruption 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:22.280
 That there is a big volcano 100,000 years ago 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.280

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.680
 One is curved fart ball and the other one drifts mysterious atmosphere not extend straight 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.150

 As you can see the voice w 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.390
 But this kind of picture the 3 groups 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.420
 It's too much energy 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.550
 It is everyone something to those things 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.550
 I think you feel 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.110
 Following power spot of Aso is Nabeke waterfall in the Omni town 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.960
 Many people visit for cool in summer 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.960
 The pot is 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.960
 It has gained popularity as the ultimate healing spot 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:02.550
 This waterfall has long been known as the Urami waterfall, as the name implies 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.550
 It is an unusual book that can be seen from behind the waterfall 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:19.370

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.370
 It is believed that this type of waterfall has been created 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.230
 goo

 I think that there is power 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:46.490
 Mr. Anai immediately takes great charm of the waterfall to the local who has continued maintenance of Nabegataki 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:51.800

 Three power spots created by Aso 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.000
