00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
don't know if that's cool or not I might

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
don't know if that's cool or not I might
let<00:00:34.230> him<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> since<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.040> hosting<00:00:35.309> well

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
let him do that since I'm hosting well

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.869 
let him do that since I'm hosting well
hosting<00:00:36.690> i<00:00:36.809> would<00:00:36.930> say<00:00:37.110> rather<00:00:37.680> i'm<00:00:38.040> doing<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
hosting i would say rather i'm doing the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.240 
hosting i would say rather i'm doing the
show<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.450> end<00:00:39.719> trying<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> commentate<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
show on my end trying to commentate and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
show on my end trying to commentate and
stuff<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.760> he<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.510> might<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.840> able

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
stuff like that so he he might be able

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.330 
stuff like that so he he might be able
to<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.140> away<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.350> flight<00:00:43.770> leave<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:44.190> would

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
to get away with flight leave i would

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
to get away with flight leave i would
definitely<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.629> could<00:00:45.809> have

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
definitely do it and then we could have

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
definitely do it and then we could have
some<00:00:46.230> other<00:00:46.379> people<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.950> filtering<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
some other people you know filtering and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
some other people you know filtering and
stuff<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.030> I'll<00:00:48.719> probably<00:00:49.079> always<00:00:49.260> be

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
stuff like that I'll probably always be

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
stuff like that I'll probably always be
wingman<00:00:50.370> number<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:51.170> in<00:00:52.170> those<00:00:52.440> situations

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
wingman number two in those situations

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.650 
wingman number two in those situations
probably<00:00:53.460> never<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> combat<00:00:54.149> lead<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
probably never the combat lead and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
probably never the combat lead and
something<00:00:55.620> else<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.949> probably<00:00:56.309> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
something else would probably be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
something else would probably be
happening<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.780> multi-player

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
happening will be you know multi-player

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680 
happening will be you know multi-player
deathmatch<00:00:59.039> games<00:00:59.460> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.539> was

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
deathmatch games kind of like what was

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
deathmatch games kind of like what was
in<00:01:00.899> ace<00:01:01.379> combat<00:01:01.680> six<00:01:02.100> from<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:02.760> he<00:01:02.879> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in ace combat six from what he was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
in ace combat six from what he was
telling<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.080> yeah<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.500> thinking<00:01:04.710> about

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
telling me so yeah I was thinking about

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
telling me so yeah I was thinking about
setting<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.489> private<00:01:05.970> matches<00:01:06.180> between

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
setting up like private matches between

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.469 
setting up like private matches between
us<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.740> our<00:01:07.790> fellow<00:01:08.790> youtubers<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
us you know all our fellow youtubers and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.080 
us you know all our fellow youtubers and
me<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.090> will

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
me you know just going at it will

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
me you know just going at it will
probably<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.450> team<00:01:12.810> deathmatch<00:01:13.320> they'll

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
probably be team deathmatch they'll

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
probably be team deathmatch they'll
probably<00:01:13.830> free<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.540> stuff

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
probably free for all you know stuff

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
probably free for all you know stuff
like<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.770> doing<00:01:16.920> those<00:01:17.220> also

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
like that so we will be doing those also

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.859 
like that so we will be doing those also
and<00:01:18.509> I'll<00:01:18.600> probably<00:01:18.810> give<00:01:19.259> some<00:01:19.560> fair<00:01:20.280> warning

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
and I'll probably give some fair warning

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.649 
and I'll probably give some fair warning
after<00:01:21.869> well<00:01:22.590> after<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.040> before<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.390> those

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
after well after it before we do those

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
after well after it before we do those
I'll<00:01:24.900> probably<00:01:25.049> start<00:01:25.320> doing<00:01:25.530> those<00:01:25.729> during

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I'll probably start doing those during

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
I'll probably start doing those during
my<00:01:26.850> playthrough<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.420> assault<00:01:28.320> horizon
