00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 there are very good guys how are you waiting 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.120
 that they are well I bring them nothing more a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.040
 fast video of what it would be pretty much 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.139
 what things they give us with we finished the way 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 advanced work campaign for nothing else is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.210
 a small video this how you see is my 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.580
 back that I had as I had already 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.350
 said I have what is the texts 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.359
 Costumes exoskeletons as you want 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.359
 call the gold for having bought 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.050
 atlas edition obviously the atlas and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 now what they gave me this they finish me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.220
 of giving a while ago in a few supplies 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.200
 but that's what they gave me at least 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.320
 to follow the atlas pants that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 They look pretty good though I do not 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.330
 I really like the Atlas boots 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.040
 I like it since generally they are all 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.350
 almost black that section of the felit and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.059
 all that in the case of atlas campaigns 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.640
 This is like the one that came to me in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.309
 born pro edition but it's much more 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 full since it brings all the gloves 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 well i do not see any any difference 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 another type of gloves but already at each 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 whoever you like 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.129
 the former atlas mate is like 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 same as what came to me simply 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 that this is much brighter for me 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.159
 he usually accompanies atlas I do not know 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 now it 's what I'm going to try maybe it's 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.990
 much better and obviously the knees 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.899
 the shin guards that do look pretty 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.470
 Okay now let's see how it would look if 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.330
 we put all this 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.800
 let's save other people 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 none of this is to say that it came to me and 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.580
 This is what I would give us the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.030
 case like these three but if you already know 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.200
 how to get it they gave us 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.830
 absolutely nothing here but let's 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.830
 put this on 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.180
 I do not remember what it was I think it was this 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.580
 for this what would be the glove 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.860
 atlas that really looks much better 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.400
 this but good let's put everything that is 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.630
 of atlas 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.460
 pants knee pads 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.920
 the boots 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.920
 and I would be almost not ready 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.700
 I remember with him was this if that would be 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.030
 totally a soldier atlas nothing more 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.030
 I would miss 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.720
 the shirt but not really getting 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.340
 all things because I missed some 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.340
 how many things to improve in me 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.340
 my exoskeleton in campaign mode then 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.860
 you know they are going to improve and they are going to 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.750
 go giving this kind of things and now 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.819
 I have two types but although I do not go out and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.500
 Well, it would not be anything more than a video 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.000
 short nothing more by teaching them more or less 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.410
 what do they give them when it is what 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.540
 is the campaign if they have not done it and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.129
 gives them eggs or they want nothing more to know if 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.739
 It's worth it because it 's worth it because 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.120
 It is fun and not apart 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.819
 ending unlocking all the garments 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290
 that they can give them so then 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.220
 see you in another video guys count 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.220
 goodbye
