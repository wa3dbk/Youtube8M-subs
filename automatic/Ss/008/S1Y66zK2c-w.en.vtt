control the gain control which is your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590 
control the gain control which is your
preamp<00:01:26.190> which<00:01:26.580> controls<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> amount<00:01:27.300> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
drive control which then controls how

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.889 
drive control which then controls how
much<00:01:31.830> preamp<00:01:32.430> signal<00:01:32.820> goes<00:01:33.270> into<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.690> power

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
much preamp signal goes into the power

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.109 
much preamp signal goes into the power
amp<00:01:34.200> you've<00:01:34.950> got<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.160> base<00:01:35.399> control

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
which controls how much high frequency

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.139 
which controls how much high frequency
presence<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.220> overall<00:01:44.789> smoothness

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.180 
presence and you know overall smoothness
of<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.690> top-end<00:01:45.899> treble<00:01:46.500> response<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.100> the

of the top-end treble response at the
amplifier<00:01:47.640> house<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.390> you've<00:01:48.510> got<00:01:48.690> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
amplifier house then you've got the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.140 
amplifier house then you've got the
master<00:01:49.170> volume<00:01:49.380> control<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.760> then<00:01:51.000> you've

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
master volume control and then you've

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.780 
master volume control and then you've
got<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> standby<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.440> power<00:01:52.619> switch<00:01:52.830> one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
got the standby and the power switch one

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.430 
got the standby and the power switch one
cool<00:01:54.000> feature<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.570> amp<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.930> well<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
cool feature on this amp as well is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.800 
cool feature on this amp as well is
there's<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.340> panel<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.970> resonance

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there's on the back panel a resonance

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.950 
there's on the back panel a resonance
control<00:01:58.260> which<00:01:58.770> basically<00:01:59.250> controls<00:01:59.960> how

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
control which basically controls how

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
control which basically controls how
loose<00:02:01.260> or<00:02:01.439> tight<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> low<00:02:02.070> end<00:02:02.280> feels<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.760> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
loose or tight the low end feels on the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.120 
loose or tight the low end feels on the
amplifier<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.020> control<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.619> range

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
amplifier so you can control a range

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.300 
amplifier so you can control a range
from<00:02:05.369> very<00:02:05.640> modern<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.240> very<00:02:06.720> focused<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:08.250> if

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
from very modern and very focused so if

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.590 
from very modern and very focused so if
you're<00:02:08.429> tuning<00:02:08.700> down<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.269> really<00:02:09.479> keep

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
you're tuning down it can really keep

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600 
you're tuning down it can really keep
your<00:02:09.780> low<00:02:09.899> end<00:02:10.049> pretty<00:02:10.170> tight<00:02:10.500> or<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> go

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
your low end pretty tight or as you go

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
your low end pretty tight or as you go
the<00:02:11.760> other<00:02:11.880> direction<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the other direction on it you can get a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.259 
the other direction on it you can get a
little<00:02:13.920> bit<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.160> vintage<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:14.910> looser
