00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.580 
continuing the MKZ s design language is
this<00:00:25.560> new<00:00:25.769> MKC<00:00:26.279> concept<00:00:27.289> it's<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this new MKC concept it's got the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.099 
this new MKC concept it's got the
typical<00:00:28.800> Lincoln<00:00:29.340> waterfall<00:00:29.789> grille

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
typical Lincoln waterfall grille

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
typical Lincoln waterfall grille
accented<00:00:31.109> by<00:00:31.320> these<00:00:31.590> LEDs<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> headlights

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
accented by these LEDs on the headlights

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720 
accented by these LEDs on the headlights
here<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.350> taillights<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.280> resemble

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
here the taillights actually do resemble

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
here the taillights actually do resemble
the<00:00:35.820> MKZ<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.420> there's<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:36.870> close<00:00:37.200> family

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the MKZ so there's a very close family

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280 
the MKZ so there's a very close family
resemblance<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:39.239> far<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.570> powertrains

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
resemblance here as far as powertrains

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
resemblance here as far as powertrains
goes<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.190> probably<00:00:41.430> expect<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
goes you can probably expect to see the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
goes you can probably expect to see the
two<00:00:42.750> liter<00:00:42.989> from<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> escape<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.280> an

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
two liter from the escape as this is an

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.029 
two liter from the escape as this is an
escape<00:00:44.820> based<00:00:45.059> crossover<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> also

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
escape based crossover and you can also

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.709 
escape based crossover and you can also
expect<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> probably<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.180> front<00:00:48.570> or

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
expect to probably see front or

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.229 
expect to probably see front or
all-wheel<00:00:48.780> drive<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.550> hoping<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
all-wheel drive and we're hoping for a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
all-wheel drive and we're hoping for a
v6<00:00:51.480> option<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> actually<00:00:52.739> come<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.640> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
v6 option and actually come to think of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
v6 option and actually come to think of
it<00:00:53.879> possibly<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> hybrid<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.590> far<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it possibly a hybrid as far as the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
it possibly a hybrid as far as the
interior<00:00:56.820> goes<00:00:57.000> who<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:57.660> know

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
interior goes who really don't know

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.389 
interior goes who really don't know
anything<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.440> expect<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
anything you can expect to see all the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
anything you can expect to see all the
technologies<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.090> you've<00:01:00.239> seen<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> MKZ

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
technologies that's you've seen the MKZ

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.779 
technologies that's you've seen the MKZ
maile<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.469> touch<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.949> kinds<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.280> Park<00:01:02.520> Assist

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
maile can touch all kinds of Park Assist

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.759 
maile can touch all kinds of Park Assist
and<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.080> technology

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and that kind of technology

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.880 
and that kind of technology
so<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> NKC<00:01:06.840> save<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> Lincoln<00:01:07.710> brand

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so will the NKC save the Lincoln brand

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.590 
so will the NKC save the Lincoln brand
that's<00:01:08.310> yet<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.670> seen<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that's yet to be seen we think it's a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.090 
that's yet to be seen we think it's a
step<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.200> direction<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.799> Lincoln

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
step in the right direction for Lincoln

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
step in the right direction for Lincoln
