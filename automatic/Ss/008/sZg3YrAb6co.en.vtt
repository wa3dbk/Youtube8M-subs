00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
today I'm gonna show you how to fix a

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.330 
today I'm gonna show you how to fix a
misfiring<00:00:18.130> engine<00:00:18.670> by<00:00:19.120> swapping<00:00:19.540> parts<00:00:20.340> now

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
misfiring engine by swapping parts now

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.400 
misfiring engine by swapping parts now
this<00:00:21.520> Camry<00:00:22.000> has<00:00:22.360> a<00:00:22.390> check<00:00:22.690> engine<00:00:23.050> light<00:00:23.230> on

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
this Camry has a check engine light on

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.410 
this Camry has a check engine light on
it<00:00:23.529> when<00:00:23.650> we<00:00:23.680> plug<00:00:23.980> in<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.190> scan<00:00:24.460> tool<00:00:24.760> we<00:00:25.390> just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
it when we plug in a scan tool we just

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.390 
it when we plug in a scan tool we just
hook<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.930> tool<00:00:26.140> into<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.590> scan<00:00:26.830> tool<00:00:27.070> port

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
hook the tool into the scan tool port

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.359 
hook the tool into the scan tool port
and<00:00:27.970> then<00:00:28.180> we<00:00:28.360> read<00:00:28.570> what<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.869> says<00:00:29.110> in<00:00:30.040> this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
and then we read what it says in this

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.270 
and then we read what it says in this
case<00:00:30.610> it<00:00:30.790> says<00:00:30.970> Pio<00:00:31.270> 304<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.590> their<00:00:32.800> number<00:00:33.070> for

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
case it says Pio 304 so their number for

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.880 
case it says Pio 304 so their number for
misfire<00:00:33.820> so<00:00:34.750> we<00:00:34.870> know<00:00:35.020> cylinder<00:00:35.530> number<00:00:35.740> four

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
misfire so we know cylinder number four

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.950 
misfire so we know cylinder number four
is<00:00:36.190> misfiring<00:00:36.460> but<00:00:37.180> whole<00:00:37.329> bunch<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.720> things

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
is misfiring but whole bunch of things

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.260 
is misfiring but whole bunch of things
can<00:00:38.170> do<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.560> could<00:00:39.280> be<00:00:39.400> a<00:00:39.430> bad<00:00:39.610> spark<00:00:40.000> plug

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
can do that could be a bad spark plug

fastest quickest the easiest way to

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
fastest quickest the easiest way to
check<00:00:52.989> it<00:00:53.199> will<00:00:53.530> just<00:00:53.710> take<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.070> cover<00:00:54.309> off

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
check it will just take the cover off

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.790 
check it will just take the cover off
pull<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.129> off<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.780> we'll<00:00:58.960> swap<00:00:59.230> ignition

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
pull it off and we'll swap ignition

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.400 
pull it off and we'll swap ignition
coils<00:01:00.390> we'll<00:01:01.390> take<00:01:01.539> off<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.899> number<00:01:02.170> four

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
coils we'll take off the number four

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.020 
coils we'll take off the number four
ignition<00:01:02.920> coil<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.989> just<00:01:05.199> take<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.500> bolt<00:01:05.680> off

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
ignition coil you just take the bolt off

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.530 
ignition coil you just take the bolt off
pull<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:07.240> off<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.900> unclip<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.560> connector

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
pull it off and unclip the connector

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.820 
pull it off and unclip the connector
then<00:01:10.540> we'll<00:01:10.660> swap<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.080> with<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.350> number<00:01:11.620> one

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
then we'll swap it with the number one

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.490 
then we'll swap it with the number one
coil<00:01:12.160> and<00:01:13.060> we<00:01:13.120> got<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.360> little<00:01:13.510> hopper<00:01:13.960> Lucy's

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
coil and we got a little hopper Lucy's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.030 
coil and we got a little hopper Lucy's
gonna<00:01:14.650> help<00:01:14.920> us<00:01:15.040> fix<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.430> today<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.920> we

gonna help us fix it today then we

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.179 
gonna help us fix it today then we
remove<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.430> number<00:01:18.820> one<00:01:18.970> coil<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.770> plugs<00:01:21.040> the

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
remove the number one coil it plugs the

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.069 
remove the number one coil it plugs the
number<00:01:21.430> four<00:01:21.670> coil<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.299> number<00:01:22.570> one<00:01:22.780> and

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
number four coil in the number one and

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.370 
number four coil in the number one and
the<00:01:23.380> number<00:01:23.530> one<00:01:23.860> plug<00:01:24.159> in<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.430> number<00:01:24.700> four

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the number one plug in the number four

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.569 
the number one plug in the number four
since<00:01:26.380> they're<00:01:26.530> now<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.799> different<00:01:27.100> positions

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
since they're now in different positions

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.819 
since they're now in different positions
if<00:01:28.329> it<00:01:28.509> shows<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.689> misfire<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.200> cylinder<00:01:29.740> number

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
if it shows a misfire on cylinder number

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.310 
if it shows a misfire on cylinder number
one<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.880> know<00:01:30.939> that<00:01:31.030> was<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.570> bad<00:01:31.689> coil<00:01:32.140> cuz

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
one you know that was the bad coil cuz

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.100 
one you know that was the bad coil cuz
we<00:01:32.470> switched<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.920> for<00:01:33.100> number<00:01:33.399> four<00:01:33.899> so<00:01:34.899> since

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
we switched it for number four so since

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.660 
we switched it for number four so since
we<00:01:35.229> put<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.560> number<00:01:35.799> four<00:01:36.040> coil<00:01:36.369> on<00:01:36.549> the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
we put the number four coil on the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.999 
we put the number four coil on the
number<00:01:36.939> one<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.930> number<00:01:37.960> one<00:01:38.380> coil<00:01:38.680> on<00:01:38.890> a

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
number one and the number one coil on a

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.920 
number one and the number one coil on a
number<00:01:39.280> four<00:01:39.490> cylinder<00:01:40.000> if<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.570> misfire

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
number four cylinder if the misfire

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.929 
number four cylinder if the misfire
changes<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.649> goes<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.920> number<00:01:42.070> one<00:01:42.369> we'll

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
changes and goes to number one we'll

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.450 
changes and goes to number one we'll
know<00:01:43.060> we<00:01:43.180> got<00:01:43.329> a<00:01:43.360> bad<00:01:43.600> ignition<00:01:43.780> coil<00:01:44.380> then<00:01:45.340> you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
know we got a bad ignition coil then you

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.310 
know we got a bad ignition coil then you
take<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.640> car<00:01:45.939> for<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.180> good<00:01:46.360> ride<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.110> if<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
take a car for a good ride and if the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.719 
take a car for a good ride and if the
check<00:01:47.530> engine<00:01:47.740> light<00:01:48.009> comes<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.369> like<00:01:48.579> this

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
check engine light comes on like this

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.819 
check engine light comes on like this
one<00:01:48.909> does<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.659> plug<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.110> scanner<00:01:50.409> in<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.710> see

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
one does you plug the scanner in and see

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.039 
one does you plug the scanner in and see
what<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.040> says<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:52.450> case<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.869> says

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
what it says and in this case it says

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.380 
what it says and in this case it says
Pio<00:01:53.259> 301<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.189> we<00:01:54.310> know<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.610> ignition<00:01:55.030> coils

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
Pio 301 so we know the ignition coils

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.109 
Pio 301 so we know the ignition coils
bad<00:01:55.600> that's<00:01:55.899> what's<00:01:56.110> causing<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.500> misfires

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
bad that's what's causing the misfires

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.459 
bad that's what's causing the misfires
so<00:01:58.119> all's<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.450> have<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.630> do<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.020> buy<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.229> new

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
so all's we have to do is buy a new

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.830 
so all's we have to do is buy a new
ignition<00:01:59.649> coil<00:02:00.189> assembly<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.939> put<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.570> on<00:02:01.719> the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
ignition coil assembly and put it on the

ignition coil assembly and put it on the
number<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:02.350> where<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.740> had<00:02:02.829> switched<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.369> bad

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
number one where we had switched the bad

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.810 
number one where we had switched the bad
coil<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.630> it'll<00:02:04.840> fix<00:02:05.020> all<00:02:05.229> our<00:02:05.259> problems

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
coil to and it'll fix all our problems

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.670 
coil to and it'll fix all our problems
just<00:02:06.820> pop<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.240> in<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.420> hole<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.960> snap<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.530> in

just pop it in the hole and snap it in

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.940 
just pop it in the hole and snap it in
and<00:02:09.630> put<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.660> little<00:02:10.930> 10<00:02:11.200> millimeter<00:02:11.650> bolt

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and put the little 10 millimeter bolt

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.390 
and put the little 10 millimeter bolt
back<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.340> place<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:14.410> put<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> cover<00:02:14.890> back<00:02:15.070> on

and tighten that on there we go
no<00:02:18.610> more<00:02:18.820> misfiring

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
no more misfiring

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.470 
no more misfiring
so<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.280> next<00:02:21.460> time<00:02:21.640> your<00:02:21.880> car<00:02:21.910> starts

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.440 
so the next time your car starts
misfiring<00:02:22.990> why<00:02:23.650> not<00:02:23.860> swap<00:02:24.190> coils<00:02:24.700> around<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
misfiring why not swap coils around to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.380 
misfiring why not swap coils around to
see<00:02:25.660> if<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.440> what's<00:02:26.650> causing<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.390> because

see if that is what's causing it because

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.570 
see if that is what's causing it because
sometimes<00:02:28.630> just<00:02:28.990> swapping<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.980> couple<00:02:30.310> parts

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
sometimes just swapping a couple parts

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.970 
sometimes just swapping a couple parts
around<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.480> easiest<00:02:31.870> way<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> diagnose<00:02:32.950> a
