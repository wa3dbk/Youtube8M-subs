00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.709
 hello welcome to the gaming channel I am 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.629
 adrián domínguez we are going to present you a 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.749
 mouse that is not yet for sale in 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.650
 Spain is the mouse chrome band of the 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.619
 brand nov 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.640
 that you can see above in the box that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.430
 we have prepared this mouse is a mouse 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.250
 gamer of the brand not as we had 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.199
 commented is a pretty economical mouse 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.720
 and that bring very very good benefits 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.879
 very high looking a little bit 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980
 features that it incorporates we can see 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.690
 that has a sensor below that is going to 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.650
 allow a fairly obvious accuracy 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.900
 quite high 128 kb internal memory 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.890
 or software that allows us to control 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.369
 all the mouse button and 6 leds 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.290
 of the representative color of the brand 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:56.479
 as we said incorporate sensor down 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.229
 which is an optical sensor with a 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:03.830
 quite high precision and it is also 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:06.049
 prepared for left-handed people is a 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.950
 ambidextrous mouse is not going to be worth 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.439
 now the two faces here we can see in 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.780
 the back of the box a series 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.520
 a little guide with all the buttons 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.439
 which includes the mouse but we are going 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.930
 to go through them and let's see them 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.150
 directly on the mouse we are going to 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.430
 open it as you can 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.400
 the box is much more careful than in 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.460
 Previous models of the chrome range is 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 a cardboard box completely and with 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.970
 the mouse inside 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.560
 we are going to raise what would be the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 wrapping where the mouse is included 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.600
 we stopped 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.590
 and here we would have the mouse directly 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.150
 let's look a little bit at what 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.570
 there is inside 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.790
 the cde with the drivers 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.790
 and a small instruction book 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 one of the things that has most 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.530
 surprised has been precisely the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.410
 presentation we are not used to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.599
 that the brand does not give us a presentation 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.200
 so high above all for your products 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.110
 of the crowe range we did not expect so 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.569
 good presentation indeed if you look 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.280
 all the details about the box are 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.910
 screenprinted with a small 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.440
 part of bright and cardboard box 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.660
 It is quite beautiful and also not only 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.940
 you can see it in the box but also 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.890
 as we have seen you can see up in 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.810
 the cde case is very careful 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.640
 the instruction book needless to say 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.680
 has that comes with all the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.490
 well-detailed instructions for 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.990
 the use of software in several languages 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.860
 how the installation changed the 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.130
 buttons everything everything very well prepared 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.440
 and regarding the mouse itself 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.700
 once again we found a mouse with 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.610
 a gold-plated usb connection and a 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.800
 braided cable 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.810
 what will allow us this cable 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.100
 do not break as easily as 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.190
 conventional mice 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.370
 let's talk a bit more about the mouse in 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.100
 if the mouse if you notice it has a way 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.740
 quite aggressive much more than the 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.340
 little brother of the no 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.760
 chrome cool 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.260
 we see here also and it also comes a lot 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.180
 more prepared you can see the ass does not bring 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.730
 the braided cable but it brings a 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.390
 simple blushed plastic cable 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.250
 yes gymnastic and precision is 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.959
 much smaller than in candás as well as 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.019
 you see also the design is much less 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.049
 aggressive in this case we have two 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.060
 grip to perfectly support the fingers 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.110
 without having to be brushing by the table 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.290
 and the buttons on the side 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.890
 which in this we only have in 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.890
 this side 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.620
 As you can see the finish of the mouse is 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.560
 a rare finish 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.180
 so much so gummy and that will give us 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.490
 a very good feeling 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.800
 we have here also the center wheel 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.560
 of the mouse a precision wheel with 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.199
 very precise movements and also here 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.260
 we have the button to change them from 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.620
 country to duels we have up to five 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.790
 bp levels and we can put it in 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.670
 500,000 thousand 500 3,000 and 4,000 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.360
 the most ambitious in the game are not going to 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.310
 have problems 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.889
 we can also see that we have 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.169
 here a small button we can 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.189
 configure through the software and here 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:02.310
 two other moments much more accessible 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:04.800
 to the touch that in the previous level we are going 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.750
 to connect it to the computer so that 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.389
 you see illuminated because it also incorporates 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.280
 the 6 flex mouse in which we are going to 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.419
 allow to have a pretty luminosity 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.419
 high on the mouse itself 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.580
 we connect it to the computer 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.789
 and we see how it starts to light up 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.740
 change color depending on how you 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.720
 let's have formed 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.720
 to fix too 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:46.339
 pink orange red blue purple and green 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.830
 we were very surprised by the ability 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.690
 that this mouse has precision in 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.720
 reference to the price that has output 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.250
 which is about 30 euros in fact is one of 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.300
 the models of the brand that have most 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.210
 we've tried it in games 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.010
 as for example in battlefield 4 the 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.590
 tight to folk and we have not had 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.720
 problems none in fact the use of the 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.430
 button to change them to ask is to say 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.370
 those of phoenix on the fly works 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.310
 pretty good and pretty fast us 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.950
 let's leave a little analysis in the 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.570
 description of the video and we found 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.060
 Our impressions on the product 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.890
 let's do some small tests for 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.410
 show them from six reais and others from 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.300
 own mouse and nothing we hope that you 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.940
 have liked the video that you have 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.730
 liked the mouse crown tandas starting 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.140
 September and see you in the 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.140
 next video see you later
