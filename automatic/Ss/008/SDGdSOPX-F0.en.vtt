00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 but many times when nobody is 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.720

 they are myths 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.160
 because they are still active some 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.940
 after 30 years practicing this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.710
 sport at the level of competition others have 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 deceased and they saw their interrupted 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 career drastically being at the most 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.380
 high and others have stopped competing but 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 they remain in the gap with labors 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.350
 important directives favoring 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.750
 discussion of this sport 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.159

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.989
 tribute then to others 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.049

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.130
 we could say that they touch it in human 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.130
 because they have been perpetuated
