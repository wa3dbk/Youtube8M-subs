00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.670
 Do you think dessert is difficult ? This strawberry Romaro 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.400
 I can't make this happen anymore 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.400
 I 'm an uncle just about to eat one ball 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.369
 Bung Boo 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:27.230
 Egg is put in cheese of mascarpone 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.890
 Oko like to eat is a brandy but you'd better not put 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.400
 I like it 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.230
 It is not ok at all without putting it 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.230
 This is the first case four pieces to 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.300
 I will use it for my skin 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:56.059
 Please mix until it is smooth to here 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.250
 This is cream of about 40% 42% 45% raw cream is still funny 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.210
 There is no condition 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.210
 This is granulated sugar 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.190
 I also have a good strawberry short cake 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.430
 That squeezed cream on a 1 minute short cake 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.410
 Let's stand up to that loose feeling there 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.410
 The last thing I did was that it was easy to use 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.760
 I look forward to seeing you again 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.600
 If you understand this feeling this feeling 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.110
 It 's like I'm going to buy a little cake for a strawberry shortcake 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.830
 The state of the Koreneko of remember a little better 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.820
 Like this 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.980
 Then you can mix it with machcarpone and eggs. 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.800
 Well there is even a little bran 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.390
 Please do not give a presentation 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.170
 This is a bit like mixing it a bit 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.540
 Please try and mix 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.070
 But this is still a bit loose 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.150
 Adjust the hardness at this point 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:07.170
 How much it squeezes onto the strawberry shortcake 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.170
 If you overdo this almost as much as fresh cream, it will not return 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.120
 If you do so, the egg white will remain , please set the egg white 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.270
 It is why are selling air taken into the egg white 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.040
 air 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.170
 One thing is fine, please take a look and the whole will be full of bubbles 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.330
 at this point 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.720

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.250
 If I do this I will do this more than this I'm going to be getting bigger 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.080
 Be careful because we will separate from you 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.490
 This is the limit 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.490
 Mix this meringue here 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.630
 I put in a lot of air, so I did not break it too much 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.980
 Because it is what built the hard way is 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.980
 I think it's too bad here 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.190
 Let's serve in this state 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.670
 Since this will be the basis of another Tiramisu 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.950
 please 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.150
 Setting'm feeling you want to eat anything if this ball full 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.140
 And turn around and clean 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.580

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.120

 Because if there is a meat, this green will be the representative in the mid 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.109
