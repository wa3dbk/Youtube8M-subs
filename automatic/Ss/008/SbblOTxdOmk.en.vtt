00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
the guitar at once and you strum all the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:16.740 
the guitar at once and you strum all the
strings<00:01:03.950> like<00:01:04.520> this<00:01:04.580> for<00:01:04.940> example

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.840 

that<00:01:17.560> was<00:01:17.710> just<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.980> few<00:01:18.130> examples<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.790> some

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
that was just a few examples of some

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.450 
that was just a few examples of some
different<00:01:19.240> chords<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:20.230> course<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:21.310> more

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
different chords and of course the more

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.610 
different chords and of course the more
chords<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.940> know<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.630> more<00:01:22.810> flexibility

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
chords you know the more flexibility

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.900 
chords you know the more flexibility
you're<00:01:23.800> going<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.010> have<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.400> be<00:01:24.520> able<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.700> play

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
you're going to have to be able to play

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.910 
you're going to have to be able to play
a<00:01:24.940> variety<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.570> different<00:01:25.780> songs<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.680> think

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
a variety of different songs so I think

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.650 
a variety of different songs so I think
it<00:01:27.190> goes<00:01:27.340> without<00:01:27.490> saying<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:28.300> it's<00:01:28.479> better

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
it goes without saying that it's better

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.810 
it goes without saying that it's better
to<00:01:28.780> learn<00:01:29.020> as<00:01:29.200> many<00:01:29.470> chords<00:01:29.979> as<00:01:30.070> possible<00:01:30.610> and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
to learn as many chords as possible and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.790 
to learn as many chords as possible and
then<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.540> really<00:01:31.960> have<00:01:32.080> got<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.380> ability<00:01:32.770> to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
then you really have got the ability to

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.070 
then you really have got the ability to
play<00:01:33.160> more<00:01:33.490> things<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.180> especially<00:01:34.690> if

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
play more things and especially if

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.210

more<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.600> more<00:02:10.780> chords<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.770> know<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:12.640> can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
more and more chords and you know we can

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880 
more and more chords and you know we can
go<00:02:12.910> from<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.300> but<00:02:13.660> let's<00:02:13.900> start<00:02:14.080> simple<00:02:14.650> so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
go from there but let's start simple so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.260 
go from there but let's start simple so
I<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> begin<00:02:15.550> by<00:02:15.610> showing<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.239> e

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
I want to begin by showing you the e

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.690 
I want to begin by showing you the e
chord<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.920> take<00:02:18.160> your<00:02:18.280> first<00:02:18.550> finger

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
chord so if you take your first finger

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.090 
chord so if you take your first finger
and<00:02:19.270> put<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.720> onto<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.080> third<00:02:20.320> string<00:02:20.739> at<00:02:21.040> fret

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
and put it onto the third string at fret

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
and put it onto the third string at fret
one<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:22.540> take<00:02:22.750> your<00:02:22.840> middle<00:02:23.080> finger<00:02:23.470> and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
one and then take your middle finger and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.410 
one and then take your middle finger and
put<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.769> onto<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.190> fifth<00:02:24.519> string<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:24.940> fret<00:02:24.970> two

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
put it onto the fifth string at fret two

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.860 
put it onto the fifth string at fret two
and<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.890> take<00:02:27.160> your<00:02:27.400> third<00:02:27.730> finger<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.480> put

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and then take your third finger and put

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.960 
and then take your third finger and put
it<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.410> fourth<00:02:30.160> string<00:02:30.400> at<00:02:30.519> fret<00:02:30.549> two

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
it on to the fourth string at fret two

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.210 
it on to the fourth string at fret two
now<00:02:31.690> if<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.900> look<00:02:32.049> at<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.230> chord<00:02:32.470> box<00:02:32.709> next<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
now if you look at the chord box next to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.009 
now if you look at the chord box next to
me<00:02:33.340> you'll<00:02:33.519> see<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.850> diagram<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.720> know<00:02:34.840> if

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
me you'll see the diagram you know if

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.840 
me you'll see the diagram you know if
you<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:35.140> need<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.560> clarify<00:02:35.799> exactly<00:02:36.700> where

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
you just need to clarify exactly where

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.729 
you just need to clarify exactly where
the<00:02:36.970> notes<00:02:37.150> go<00:02:37.420> now<00:02:38.080> what<00:02:38.260> I'm<00:02:38.320> gonna<00:02:38.410> ask<00:02:38.560> you

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
the notes go now what I'm gonna ask you

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.410 
the notes go now what I'm gonna ask you
to<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.220> hold<00:02:39.430> down<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:40.000> plenty<00:02:40.390> of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
to do is hold down with plenty of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
to do is hold down with plenty of
pressure<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.140> strum<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> strings

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.089 

now<00:02:45.420> ideally<00:02:46.140> all<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.500> those<00:02:46.650> notes<00:02:46.920> were

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
now ideally all of those notes were

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.860 
now ideally all of those notes were
saying<00:02:47.340> nice<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.790> clear<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:48.720> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
saying nice and clear like that but to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.750 
saying nice and clear like that but to
be<00:02:48.900> honest<00:02:49.260> I'd<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.620> surprised<00:02:50.099> if<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> get<00:02:50.640> it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
be honest I'd be surprised if you get it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.270 
be honest I'd be surprised if you get it
signed<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.090> perfect<00:02:51.540> straight<00:02:51.840> away<00:02:52.080> it'd<00:02:53.040> be

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
signed in perfect straight away it'd be

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
signed in perfect straight away it'd be
it'd<00:02:53.819> be<00:02:53.849> perfectly<00:02:54.360> normal<00:02:54.569> if<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.959> sounded

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
it'd be perfectly normal if it sounded

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.650 
it'd be perfectly normal if it sounded
more<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:57.170> first<00:02:58.170> now<00:02:59.069> let<00:02:59.280> me<00:02:59.370> explain

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
more like this first now let me explain

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.119 
more like this first now let me explain
some<00:03:00.660> common<00:03:01.050> mistakes<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.560> people<00:03:01.709> make

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
some common mistakes that people make

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.949 
some common mistakes that people make
when<00:03:02.160> learning<00:03:02.370> chords<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.569> need<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.810> do

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
when learning chords what you need to do

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
when learning chords what you need to do
is<00:03:04.110> make<00:03:04.319> sure<00:03:04.349> you're<00:03:04.769> holding<00:03:05.129> down<00:03:05.280> with

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
is make sure you're holding down with

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.979 
is make sure you're holding down with
the<00:03:05.549> tip<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.910> your<00:03:05.970> finger<00:03:06.450> with<00:03:06.599> plenty<00:03:06.959> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
the tip of your finger with plenty of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.110 
the tip of your finger with plenty of
pressure<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.739> need<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.459> arch<00:03:08.700> these

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
pressure and you need to arch these

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.089 
pressure and you need to arch these
fingers<00:03:09.599> up<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.140> reason<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.830> is

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
fingers up and the reason for that is

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.949 
fingers up and the reason for that is
because<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.760> want<00:03:12.090> plenty<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.629> space

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
because you want plenty of space

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.930 
because you want plenty of space
underneath<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> fingers<00:03:14.160> what<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.790> don't

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
underneath the fingers what we don't

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.640 
underneath the fingers what we don't
want<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.239> happen<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.230> back<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.440> these

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
want to happen is for the back of these

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
want to happen is for the back of these
fingers<00:03:17.099> accidentally<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.120> touch<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.750> next

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
fingers accidentally to touch the next

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.949 
fingers accidentally to touch the next
string<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.440> obstruct<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> note<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.720> when<00:03:21.900> you

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
string and obstruct the note so when you

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.240 
string and obstruct the note so when you
pluck<00:03:22.230> each<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> strings<00:03:22.980> with<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
pluck each of the strings with the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.660 
pluck each of the strings with the
plectrum

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.030 

it<00:03:28.240> should<00:03:28.569> say<00:03:28.750> nice<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.350> clear<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:29.830> that

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
it should say nice and clear like that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.190 
it should say nice and clear like that
so<00:03:30.700> if<00:03:30.760> any<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.030> these<00:03:31.120> notes<00:03:31.360> sound<00:03:31.690> incorrect

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
so if any of these notes sound incorrect

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.660 
so if any of these notes sound incorrect
is<00:03:32.350> probably<00:03:32.680> because<00:03:32.800> you're<00:03:33.010> accidentally

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
is probably because you're accidentally

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.180 
is probably because you're accidentally
touching<00:03:34.330> one<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.500> strings<00:03:35.860> with<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
touching one of the strings with the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.280 
touching one of the strings with the
back<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.640> your<00:03:36.670> fingers<00:03:37.150> accidentally<00:03:38.020> okay

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
back of your fingers accidentally okay

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.230 
back of your fingers accidentally okay
so<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.130> might<00:03:39.250> take<00:03:39.520> a<00:03:39.550> little<00:03:39.730> bit<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.060> work

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
so it might take a little bit of work

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.820 
so it might take a little bit of work
and<00:03:40.510> you'll<00:03:40.630> need<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.900> shuffle<00:03:41.170> your<00:03:41.380> fingers

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.040 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers
around<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.250> get<00:03:42.400> used<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.790> how<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> hold<00:03:43.840> down

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
around and get used to how to hold down

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.690 
around and get used to how to hold down
the<00:03:44.200> chord<00:03:44.470> but<00:03:44.680> eventually<00:03:44.980> you'll<00:03:45.430> get<00:03:45.550> it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the chord but eventually you'll get it

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.480 
the chord but eventually you'll get it
sounding<00:03:46.000> nice<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.360> clear

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
sounding nice and clear

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.880 
sounding nice and clear
so<00:03:49.150> that's<00:03:49.330> something<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.660> work<00:03:49.870> towards<00:03:50.530> so

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
so that's something to work towards so

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.380 
so that's something to work towards so

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
finger on the fourth string of fret 2

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.210 
finger on the fourth string of fret 2
and<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.320> middle<00:03:59.560> finger<00:03:59.920> on<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.070> third

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
and the middle finger on the third

and the middle finger on the third
string<00:04:00.430> at<00:04:01.120> fret<00:04:01.180> 2<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.930> then<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:03.160> third

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
string at fret 2 and then the third

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.030 
string at fret 2 and then the third
finger<00:04:03.850> on<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> second<00:04:04.540> string<00:04:04.570> at<00:04:04.900> fret<00:04:04.930> 2<00:04:05.470> so

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
finger on the second string at fret 2 so

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.550 
finger on the second string at fret 2 so
they're<00:04:06.490> all<00:04:06.700> at<00:04:06.940> fret<00:04:07.180> 2<00:04:07.450> but<00:04:07.840> unfortunately

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
they're all at fret 2 but unfortunately

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.260 
they're all at fret 2 but unfortunately
there's<00:04:08.740> not<00:04:08.860> quite<00:04:09.190> enough<00:04:09.430> room<00:04:09.550> really<00:04:10.090> to

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
there's not quite enough room really to

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.690 
there's not quite enough room really to
fit<00:04:10.540> them<00:04:10.690> all<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:11.050> ideally<00:04:12.040> we'd<00:04:12.250> like<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.580> get

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
fit them all in ideally we'd like to get

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.430 
fit them all in ideally we'd like to get
them<00:04:12.850> right<00:04:13.060> next<00:04:13.240> to<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.570> fret<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.170> in

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
them right next to the fret but in

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.620 
them right next to the fret but in
reality<00:04:14.710> what<00:04:15.220> happens<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.790> we<00:04:16.000> end<00:04:16.030> up<00:04:16.330> using

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
reality what happens is we end up using

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.240 
reality what happens is we end up using
them<00:04:16.900> at<00:04:16.989> an<00:04:17.080> angle<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.680> because

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
them at an angle like this because

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.130 
them at an angle like this because
that's<00:04:18.550> the<00:04:18.670> only<00:04:18.760> way<00:04:18.970> really<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.390> squash

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
that's the only way really to squash

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.200 
that's the only way really to squash
them<00:04:20.380> in<00:04:20.530> there<00:04:20.770> and<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.549> course<00:04:21.610> everyone's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
them in there and of course everyone's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.640 
them in there and of course everyone's
hands<00:04:22.450> are<00:04:22.660> different<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:23.200> know<00:04:23.320> if<00:04:23.500> you've

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
hands are different you know if you've

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.320 
hands are different you know if you've
got<00:04:23.680> skinny<00:04:24.160> little<00:04:24.370> fingers<00:04:24.610> then<00:04:25.030> you'll

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
got skinny little fingers then you'll

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.690 
got skinny little fingers then you'll
probably<00:04:25.480> find<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.900> easier<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.950> look<00:04:27.490> at<00:04:27.610> the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
probably find it easier so look at the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.310 
probably find it easier so look at the
chord<00:04:27.910> chart<00:04:28.150> next<00:04:28.390> to<00:04:28.570> me<00:04:28.690> just<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:29.080> clarify

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
chord chart next to me just to clarify

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.300 
chord chart next to me just to clarify
what<00:04:29.890> notes

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
what notes

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.640 
what notes

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
we're holding down now with the a chord

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.100 
we're holding down now with the a chord
we're<00:04:32.920> just<00:04:33.340> gonna<00:04:33.460> use<00:04:33.700> five<00:04:33.970> strings<00:04:34.480> and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
we're just gonna use five strings and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.780 
we're just gonna use five strings and
what<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.350> mean<00:04:35.560> by<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.220> we're<00:04:36.430> not<00:04:36.580> going

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
what I mean by that is we're not going

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.070 
what I mean by that is we're not going
to<00:04:36.850> pluck<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> sixth<00:04:37.480> string<00:04:37.690> we're<00:04:37.900> just

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
usually happens the back of this finger

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.110 
usually happens the back of this finger
on<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.470> cords<00:04:55.009> accidentally<00:04:55.610> touches<00:04:55.970> the

people get muddled up with this one the
middle<00:05:24.030> finger<00:05:24.390> goes<00:05:24.570> on<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.050> first

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
middle finger goes on to the first

next to you so you don't have to keep

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.059 
next to you so you don't have to keep
rewinding<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.629> video<00:06:12.900> and<00:06:13.259> practice<00:06:13.650> them

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
rewinding the video and practice them

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
and practice them and get them sounding

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.209 
and practice them and get them sounding
nice<00:06:15.569> and<00:06:15.810> clear<00:06:18.710> now<00:06:19.710> there's<00:06:19.949> something

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
nice and clear now there's something

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.709 
nice and clear now there's something
else<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.520> want<00:06:20.699> to<00:06:20.759> tell<00:06:20.969> you<00:06:21.150> you<00:06:21.389> may<00:06:21.569> have

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
else I want to tell you you may have

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.350 
else I want to tell you you may have
noticed<00:06:22.259> my<00:06:22.440> thumb<00:06:22.889> sort<00:06:23.610> of<00:06:23.729> kind<00:06:23.969> of<00:06:24.060> hanging

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
noticed my thumb sort of kind of hanging

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.730 
noticed my thumb sort of kind of hanging
around<00:06:24.629> here<00:06:24.870> over<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.199> top<00:06:25.379> of<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.590> guitar

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
around here over the top of the guitar

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.980 
around here over the top of the guitar
and<00:06:26.099> there<00:06:26.219> is<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.370> reason<00:06:26.610> for<00:06:27.000> this<00:06:27.180> when

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
and there is a reason for this when

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.020 
and there is a reason for this when
we're<00:06:28.139> strumming<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.500> a<00:06:28.650> chord<00:06:29.099> for<00:06:30.000> example

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
we're strumming the a chord for example

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.209 
we're strumming the a chord for example
we<00:06:30.659> don't<00:06:30.930> want<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.379> sixth<00:06:31.710> string<00:06:31.949> to

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
we don't want the sixth string to

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.249 
we don't want the sixth string to
accidentally<00:06:32.879> make<00:06:32.909> a<00:06:33.090> noise<00:06:33.330> so<00:06:33.780> what<00:06:34.169> I'm

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
accidentally make a noise so what I'm

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.290 
accidentally make a noise so what I'm
doing<00:06:34.289> is<00:06:34.710> gently<00:06:35.340> touching<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.940> just<00:06:36.180> a

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
doing is gently touching it just a

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.659 
doing is gently touching it just a
little<00:06:36.449> bit<00:06:36.810> with<00:06:37.409> the<00:06:37.650> thumb<00:06:37.889> and<00:06:38.370> that's

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
little bit with the thumb and that's

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.930 
little bit with the thumb and that's
enough<00:06:39.330> just<00:06:39.539> to<00:06:39.659> mute<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.169> note<00:06:40.379> so<00:06:40.710> it<00:06:40.940> it

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
enough just to mute the note so it it

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.640 
enough just to mute the note so it it
stops<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.539> sixth<00:06:42.810> string<00:06:42.930> from<00:06:43.110> accidentally

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
stops the sixth string from accidentally

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.649 
stops the sixth string from accidentally
making<00:06:43.979> a<00:06:44.069> noise<00:06:44.190> and<00:06:44.639> then<00:06:45.060> when<00:06:45.240> you<00:06:45.330> strum

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
making a noise and then when you strum

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.060 
making a noise and then when you strum
all<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:46.020> five<00:06:46.199> strings

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
all the five strings

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.890 
all the five strings
and<00:06:48.670> you<00:06:48.790> know<00:06:48.970> you're<00:06:49.150> only<00:06:49.300> just<00:06:49.660> getting

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
and you know you're only just getting

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.630 
and you know you're only just getting
the<00:06:49.990> correct<00:06:50.320> notes<00:06:50.560> that<00:06:50.770> you<00:06:50.890> want<00:06:51.100> so

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
the correct notes that you want so

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.520 
the correct notes that you want so
that's<00:06:51.760> the<00:06:51.940> reason<00:06:52.090> for<00:06:52.330> that<00:06:52.630> so<00:06:53.320> what<00:06:53.470> you

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
that's the reason for that so what you

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.440 
that's the reason for that so what you
can<00:06:53.800> do<00:06:54.040> once<00:06:54.370> you've<00:06:54.550> learned<00:06:54.760> these<00:06:54.970> chords

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
can do once you've learned these chords

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.780 
can do once you've learned these chords
is<00:06:55.720> put<00:06:56.530> them<00:06:56.650> into<00:06:56.770> a<00:06:56.890> bit<00:06:57.040> of<00:06:57.070> a<00:06:57.220> sequence<00:06:57.640> for

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.269 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for
example<00:06:58.360> you<00:06:58.480> could<00:06:58.690> play<00:06:58.930> the<00:06:59.110> a<00:06:59.140> chord

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.309 

four<00:07:02.909> times<00:07:03.239> and<00:07:03.599> then<00:07:03.689> you<00:07:03.779> could<00:07:03.899> play<00:07:03.989> the<00:07:04.169> D

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
four times and then you could play the D

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.989 
four times and then you could play the D
chord

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:06.999 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:10.130 

back<00:07:07.479> to<00:07:07.659> the<00:07:07.779> a

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.469 

and<00:07:10.680> then<00:07:10.830> the<00:07:10.980> e-court

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:24.700 

and<00:07:13.779> then<00:07:13.900> you<00:07:13.990> can<00:07:14.110> do<00:07:14.229> that<00:07:14.349> again

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.249 

so<00:07:25.550> you<00:07:25.610> can<00:07:25.789> begin<00:07:25.940> practicing<00:07:26.720> changing

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:27.259 
so you can begin practicing changing
