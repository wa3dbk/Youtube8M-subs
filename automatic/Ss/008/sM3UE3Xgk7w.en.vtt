go ahead and do this ready set go it's
about<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.790> same<00:01:12.530> loading<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:15.229> edge<00:01:16.229> first

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
about the same loading and edge first

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.109 
about the same loading and edge first
and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.400> followed<00:01:17.820> by<00:01:18.799> followed<00:01:19.799> by<00:01:19.979> ACC<00:01:20.970> one

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and then followed by followed by ACC one

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.380 
and then followed by followed by ACC one
m9<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.170> here<00:01:22.950> number<00:01:23.220> seven<00:01:23.700> point<00:01:23.850> six<00:01:24.090> seven

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
m9 so here number seven point six seven

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.170 
m9 so here number seven point six seven
seconds<00:01:25.200> versus<00:01:26.040> eight<00:01:26.280> point<00:01:26.580> five<00:01:26.759> seconds

to<00:02:36.370> make<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.700> fair<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.270> see<00:02:37.660> how<00:02:37.780> fast<00:02:38.050> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
to make it fair and see how fast is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.590 
to make it fair and see how fast is
let's<00:02:38.590> try<00:02:38.830> clash<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.310> clans<00:02:39.640> loading<00:02:40.420> time

alright<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:45.250> seems<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.610> be<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.060> delay

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
alright there seems to be a little delay

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.990 
alright there seems to be a little delay
with<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.110> guest<00:02:47.320> Galaxy<00:02:48.010> s6<00:02:48.370> edge<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
with the guest Galaxy s6 edge but it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.940 
with the guest Galaxy s6 edge but it
does<00:02:49.239> load<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.600> lot<00:02:49.870> faster<00:02:50.350> once<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.680> starts

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
does load a lot faster once it starts

alright let me go ahead and exit out of
those<00:03:49.250> um<00:03:49.719> in<00:03:50.719> this<00:03:51.019> test<00:03:51.379> I<00:03:51.560> just<00:03:51.590> simply<00:03:52.129> hit

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
those um in this test I just simply hit

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.199 
those um in this test I just simply hit
the<00:03:52.569> pause<00:03:53.569> button<00:03:53.739> when<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:55.209> character

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
the pause button when the character

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.589 
the pause button when the character
started<00:03:56.569> talking<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.079> you<00:03:57.140> can<00:03:57.349> see<00:03:57.560> 6<00:03:57.950> seconds

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
started talking so you can see 6 seconds

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.380 
started talking so you can see 6 seconds
4<00:03:59.599> 6<00:04:00.230> X<00:04:00.409> 6<00:04:00.680> point<00:04:00.950> 1<00:04:01.040> 3<00:04:01.370> seconds<00:04:01.760> for<00:04:01.909> the<00:04:02.030> Galaxy

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
4 6 X 6 point 1 3 seconds for the Galaxy

s6 edge and 7 point 1 3 seconds for the
HTC<00:04:06.319> one<00:04:06.470> m9<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.670> these<00:04:07.849> tests<00:04:08.180> conclude<00:04:08.599> that

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
HTC one m9 so these tests conclude that

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.379 
HTC one m9 so these tests conclude that
the<00:04:08.989> s6<00:04:09.500> edge<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:09.829> indeed<00:04:10.670> much<00:04:10.939> much<00:04:11.180> faster

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
the s6 edge is indeed much much faster

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.830 
the s6 edge is indeed much much faster
especially<00:04:12.189> the<00:04:13.189> more<00:04:13.370> graphic<00:04:13.909> intensive<00:04:14.450> it

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
especially the more graphic intensive it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.039 
especially the more graphic intensive it
gets<00:04:15.079> like<00:04:15.859> for<00:04:16.099> games<00:04:16.340> like<00:04:16.849> asphalt<00:04:17.180> 8<00:04:17.810> and

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
gets like for games like asphalt 8 and

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.360 
gets like for games like asphalt 8 and
clash<00:04:18.349> of<00:04:18.530> clans<00:04:18.889> we<00:04:19.699> saw<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.000> huge<00:04:20.599> difference

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.879 
clash of clans we saw a huge difference
50%<00:04:22.370> or<00:04:22.520> more<00:04:22.910> performance<00:04:23.840> boost<00:04:24.229> over<00:04:24.710> the

the<00:04:36.320> Qualcomm<00:04:36.919> Snapdragon<00:04:37.099> 810<00:04:37.990> especially

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 especially

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.020 
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 especially
if<00:04:39.080> there's<00:04:39.349> more<00:04:39.590> graphics<00:04:40.190> involved<00:04:40.820> more

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
if there's more graphics involved more

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.379 
if there's more graphics involved more
graphic<00:04:41.509> intensive<00:04:41.900> apps<00:04:42.470> definitely<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.880> s6

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
graphic intensive apps definitely the s6

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.899 
graphic intensive apps definitely the s6
edge<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.599> gonna<00:04:45.020> win<00:04:45.500> out<00:04:45.800> anyway<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.610> have

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
edge is gonna win out anyway I have

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.320 
edge is gonna win out anyway I have
clearly<00:04:47.449> proved<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.650> performance

clearly proved to you the performance

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.430 
clearly proved to you the performance
improvements<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:50.570> I'm<00:04:50.690> sure<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.169> do

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
improvements and I'm sure you can do

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.990 
improvements and I'm sure you can do
this<00:04:51.650> test<00:04:52.039> if<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.340> have<00:04:52.490> both<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:52.760> these

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
this test if you have both of these

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.700 
this test if you have both of these
phones<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.599> the<00:04:53.840> results<00:04:54.349> are<00:04:54.500> probably

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
phones and the results are probably

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.710 
phones and the results are probably
gonna<00:04:54.949> be<00:04:55.039> identical<00:04:55.789> now<00:04:55.940> for<00:04:56.210> those<00:04:56.360> of<00:04:56.419> you

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
gonna be identical now for those of you

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.020 
gonna be identical now for those of you
