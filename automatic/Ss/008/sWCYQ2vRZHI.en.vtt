00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 if we put sunscreen on 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.700
 protect us from the sun's rays 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 we should also do the same with 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 our eyes good sunglasses 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 can we prevent the spoiling us 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.130
 sight and attention because the experts 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.170
 they say it's not worth any 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 and what is clear is that the glasses 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.860
 so they are for that to protect us 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.810
 of the sun so in closed places and with 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.689
 artificial light must be removed because 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.090
 first of all you have to protect yourself patricia and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.160
 we worry more and more if every time 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.239
 we care more so much what is for 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.710
 the sunglasses at the time of 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.660
 protect our eyesight that is something very 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 important as well as what is the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 fashion that in fact they also sell 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
 sunglasses no longer just to protect 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.220
 but also as a complement more than 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 fashion and by models was not because here 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.480
 we have a lot and there is a variety of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430
 man there are women's children for person 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.560
 more elder here the narrow faces 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.270
 great although what most of all is 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.430
 this year is the big downside 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.650
 let's see fashion sunglasses 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.510
 this summer 2007 patrician and yes that 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.240
 come this year the glasses because 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 here tamara wears a piece of glasses 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.470
 yes exact what is rather big glasses 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 as for example you can see in this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.610
 model comes a lot what is the tone 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.259
 white rods what are wide the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.700
 degraded tone of the lens that by 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.310
 up is a little bit darker though 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 here it is not appreciated much but it continues and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.359
 below it 's a little bit lighter then 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.750
 the pasta is what most the material that 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.950
 more much more than metal 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.479
 then have what it is like you can 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.360
 check recipes from ig de dolce gabbana 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.710
 and bring the extras that the strass itself 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.540
 comes too much incorporated into the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.430
 sunglasses this year and although the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.729
 crystals we see each other 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.500
 colors the lenses protect us like yes 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.420
 Exactly the glasses carry what is a 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.940
 eye protection against 100% 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.130
 Grape rays then there is what is the filter 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.020
 which goes from 1 to 4 depending on the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.030
 hue of the lens for example what 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.950
 is a dark tone will always remove the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.479
 light more than a light tone and so 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.729
 depending on the hue against more 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.220
 dark more remove the light and all these 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.770
 glasses are for women are for men we 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.690
 they serve for both sexes most 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.600
 of the glasses are unisex they serve both 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.280
 for men as for women and there are few 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.020
 models that differ only from men 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.399
 or only as a woman as many times 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.410
 think when you go to a store 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.540
 sunglasses and what is clear is that 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.730
 It always becomes a bit, well, years 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.550
 back because these glasses these glasses the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.120
 had my father in the 60 flights seventies 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.130
 and it's a classic ray-ban has always been 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.070
 worn that goggle and now it comes back again 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.480
 fashionable the lenses are minerals what 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.239
 means that water 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.430
 and then it will grate less than another 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.980
 type of lens but against if it falls 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.420
 the ground tends more to break than the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.890
 another type of lens that is the organic 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.959
 which is most of the glasses that 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.909
 do today, so this year all 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.709
 of pilots and the last thing we have in 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.930
 sunglasses is what you have in the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.750
 hands not exact tamara is the last 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.930
 dior model is a screen 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.730
 but it has a weirdest thing is the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.410
 Rods we remove the rods from 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.260
 within the thanks act are two 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.840
 wires that come out from inside the gau 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.700
 and it is all security will not split 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.069
 wires we 're not going to run out of fat 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.590
 Normal wire is specific for this 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.680
 goggle then to place us we have it 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.750
 take the handles and place it 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.000
 back and those that can not be missing are 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.440
 also sports sunglasses like 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.420
 these that I carry here whatever they are are very 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
 narrow these is that they are more 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.069
 specific to sport what is for 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.530
 beach sport to ski for 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.959
 bicycle all for sports that way 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.420
 it narrows very justita the face and very 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.340
 light and here we have camera with glasses 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.540
 for children who also have to 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.370
 protect from the sun 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.230
 as the weather is now the children 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.790
 are the ones that are going to have more problems 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.620
 with the sun then they have done and I do 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.480
 appointments for children a lot more glasses 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.859
 modernists the kind of pilot that is what 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.670
 that are coming but also for the 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:50.209
 children we have some of here also more 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.890
 sports for children and the last thing 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.349
 last that arrives is the last the last 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.280
 those of babies we already have 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.950
 glasses for babies yes yes and babies of a 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.480

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.400
