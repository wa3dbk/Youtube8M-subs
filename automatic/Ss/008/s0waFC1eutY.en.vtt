00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello to all I come back with a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.480
 new cosplay category on my channel 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.189
 and to start it well I will 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.070
 start with a small series of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.320
 videos about life is strange 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.269
 especially on max there will be 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.470
 several types of videos ie 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 leagues flocks for the t-shirt 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.110
 as well as the bag a makeup tutorial a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.120
 tuto hairstyle and to finish the cosplay 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.860
 final so when it is finished 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.660
 and today I show you how 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.580
 I made the bracelets that Maxim 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 door is really easy to do 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.269
 So to begin gold bracelets 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 needs three leaves of Christian 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.730
 so dark red foam 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.559
 and blue the leaves of Christian foam 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.559
 found in leisure stores 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.819
 creative or in paper mills 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.829
 Then we will need a pair of 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.749
 scissors of a pencil and a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 rule so I first take care of 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.030
 cut the strips for 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.769
 bracelet 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.809
 so we take the Christian leaf 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.780
 foam and we just do a little 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.889
 notch 8 mm wide so I'm coming 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.600
 do that up and down 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:06.210
 then when it's done I come 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.880
 connect the two points with the rule I 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.740
 trace a line and I just listen and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.329
 that's what it gives so we take 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 exactly the same length of the tail 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.740
 the foam created and so you have to do 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.259
 that for the three colors 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 so for this second stage we will have 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.100
 need our three banks to create a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 foam of a black string so I have 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.180
 taken in general I cut out on my 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.509
 clothes the black string ends 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.859
 who's out there who are logically there for 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.869
 hang on the hangers but I 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.009
 do not like it so I discover that but 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.310
 you can very well take another 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.130
 thing 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.480
 then you will need glue from the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.610
 tip of a compass and a land of 6 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.440
 to start using the fight I 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.180
 makes a hole at each end of the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.550
 bank to create foam I come 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.620
 then passed the ribbon in a hole I 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.100
 takes over and I do best for 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.100
 secure 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.460
 then I cut anything over and 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.180
 games to do the same process for 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.180
 the other hole 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.990
 you can fix with glue the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.640
 two ends for more safety 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.640
 but this step is optional 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
 so that's it for the end result and 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.740
 then to talk to you a little about life is 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.390
 strange so this is a game I have 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.610
 really had a huge crush 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.740
 sincerely everything is beautiful the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.020
 music the story the graphics and 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.430
 the endearing characters that we 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.050
 can easily identify himself 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.610
 I really advise you to go to 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.710
 discover the links fell barda 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.890
 so in the meantime I tell you to 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.890
 soon
