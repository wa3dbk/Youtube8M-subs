00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.600
 hi all guys have come 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.360
 jenkins and I find myself forced back to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 make this video for obvious reasons has 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.099
 had to leave the other next 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.270
 ok what is this video in 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.640
 easily explain how to take 9000 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.480
 bar 11 thousand souls very much 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.369
 game easy for the first few hours of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.510
 pacts for those who bought dark souls 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.160
 open that scrape together so many souls 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.540
 at the beginning of our adventure in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.680
 so little time is really a thing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 really really a unique one anyway 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:49.559
 first you will have to open this door 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.410
 this is your to open this door to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.960
 have the cemetery symbol or something 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.140
 this symbol will be inserted 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 in this circular indentation and of the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 capable of poverty 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.229
 the symbol can be taken from andrea di 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.510
 astra and that is the fabio that you will find 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.420
 prior to this point before 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.580
 this key or vitamin demo 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.189
 this symbol to have this time 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.030
 can you spoken you will be able to recover it in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.509
 two ways by killing the smith or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 buying him twenty thousand souls once 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.780
 arrived here and that is in the garden e 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.159
 dark root remember to hit 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 this wall so that there is 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 will open this time you can rest 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:37.020
 this value therefore therefore that which one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 start trick then go down 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 this eye scale in this area 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 there were enemies that could not be cited with the button 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:50.060
 right and analogic to attract 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.060
 the attention of this magician 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:05.259
 go into the basement and wait 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.259
 let the wizard take his course 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.080
 will come up here and down into the abyss 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.099
 here I entered e6420 souls 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.819
 away from lina also that I am at 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.310
 game 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.980
 third or fourth so the souls 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.810
 tripled in this case would have you 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 given two thousand souls the file the magician who 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.849
 just fell into the abyss, however 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.819
 as you can see the trick is easy but 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.799
 if I promised you 11,000 a 9 thousand souls 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.510
 why have we taken since 2000 because 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.000
 perhaps not only the magician can be 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.840
 lured into this mere trap by 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.379
 rascals and in fact we will continue rights 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.209
 in this our odyssey 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:59.269
 here a monk will activate ours 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.970
 attention and even a bandit ok too 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.980
 an even an invisible little killer 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.349
 the invisible killer cannot be 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.940
 toe plate for which you run and eyes a 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.420
 don't get hit by your back 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.849
 assassin attacks will be deadly 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:20.560
 for beginner players to gird 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.560
 I move under the stairs and wait 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:33.650
 1 and 36 thousand souls for you will be 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.650
 other 2000 2 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.630
 this is something that can happen but 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.230
 as you see the war magician alone vi 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.230
 just pay 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.510
 ok in theory here we came to a 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.230
 total of 8,000 souls for me 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.020
 naturally they have increased in a way 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.090
 assiduous since I am a repeat to the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:10.040
 fourth game until third non 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.810
 but I remember this is how gentlemen 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:19.220
 I hope I have been helpful and that 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:23.170
 tell you here you people got jenkins here 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.170
 that greets you guys
