 But because the movement of the horse I was not able to roughly organized in the head 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.119
 It is this that the spray came up by the wind 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.860
 It was in harmony with the movement of the horse that he made the movement 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.920
 I think accidentally after a little funny 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.920

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:11.310
 Assemble this way 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 Chasing chase while thinking whether body and color horse and the town take or resonate 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.310
 Do not speak horse language 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.480
 Humans can speak words 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:27.700

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.700
 I thing reblogged Willing to have attracted great somewhere in the mind 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.909
 of 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:40.380
 500 f 4 there is also the time Pick conditions say backlit 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:44.450
 I was relieved because it was severe but it was a work that I felt relieved 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:50.979
 To be able to do is take in the clear because Crystal 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.979
 As for me, there is a place called to have you finish it sharper than I thought 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.470
 I am 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.470
 The

 Hmm 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.680
 true 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.230
 Hmm 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:14.540
 Even if it is assembled and you can see the picture, it will not be such a fulfillment if you get it 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:19.670
 Something more here Nde I at the moment that fell there something of the elements is good seems to come with a jerk 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:23.980
 The word " can't do it" always wants to go the last thing 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 You will be grasped
