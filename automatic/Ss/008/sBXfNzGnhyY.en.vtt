00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.090

 Although a few you yourself with it one 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.599
 a little summer mood is coming 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.869
 because it is so soon again so much 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.869
 fun 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.820
 for the first animal you need 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.920
 Jam jar I have mine from dibo 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.420
 had had the really nice out looking 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.910
 I alone the writing is full 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.010
 beautiful then not recognize 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 This is especially important and conclusive 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 also colorful flowers 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.290
 we want a really nice glass with us 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.900
 have flowers and that 's all 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.000
 Well , I have the flowers in it 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.040
 bent together I think it looks like 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.750
 I did that then I have the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.729
 I took that 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.890
 By the way, from depot there was one 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.540
 time in the sales but you will 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.729
 sure somewhere in such 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.170
 jewelry shops and decorations 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.229
 lots of fairy lights 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.940
 find and the flowers are from the ikea the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.580
 did not cost that much i think 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.619
 as well as 23 euros and that's it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.780
 already the finished by the sap i 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.330
 think it looks so beautiful and for the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.920
 Spring fits in well with my 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.720
 I did that on my own 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.320
 You can come back from Siebold 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 plant 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.799
 Now there's another one 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.659
 josef and I really have 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.719
 very much and you actually see it 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.209
 in every tumblr under quotes 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.280
 Room and I thought I would do that 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.500
 now I too have just one 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.299
 few pictures expressed and there that are 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.440
 I have become much too big for myself 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.930
 It actually wanted a little different 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.569
 but that does not matter anyway 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.000
 quite acceptable than me then 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.579
 I just finished everything 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.840
 in the right order 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.230
 and then I just have my budget 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.430
 taken off and the whole with so 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.540
 double-sided boschek is now that 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.549
 I did it 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.410
 yes then just off to the band with the 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.780
 think that makes the room just like that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.370
 a bit more spring like this one 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 a bit in the summer mood as I too 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.750
 pretty cheerful colors have taken 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.209
 that's such a little preparation for 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.860
 summer and summer I will too 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.599
 a lot of those currently talking about themselves though 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.610
 he is pleased then there is a video yet 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.060
 a thumbs up and I'm happy 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.769
 Alright to shoot these videos 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.540
 We love a lot of pictures about 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.700
 that's why i thought i was 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.590
 on my hanging box then still in 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.980
 picture stickers that looks really great 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.980
 out 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.760
 No 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.280
 the next do it yourself is for 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.019
 memories and I think that's it 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.810
 most beautiful video even I ever made 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.730
 It just fits every team up and down 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.260
 every time you look at it 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.439
 you have your nice photos with friends 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.810
 or any beautiful ones 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.269
 Picture frame then a thread with it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.390
 Her pictures depend on such clips 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.849
 on tacks photo paper so that he 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.590
 you could have printed photos 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.780
 and absolutely something to nibble 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.150
 so that during the tinkering he can 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.440
 I have something delicious to eat 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.420
 I started with that 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.440
 picture frame out the back part 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.510
 have given 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.030
 and then I already have the trip 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.709
 taken and looked at where the am 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.689
 Best match choice 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.760
 I also want to be able to hang jewelry 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.590
 because that's pretty handy and that 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.239
 looked pretty good below 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.099
 and now I have just tried 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.870
 but it does not quite like that 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.389
 that 's why i have the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.310
 hammer brought and he would have to be careful 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.739
 beat up because it breaks apart otherwise 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.180
 the picture frame splinters that off 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.220
 it happened to me a little bit once 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.130
 but you just have to be careful 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.109
 and then you need it already 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.299
 her a thread I have the depot 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.690
 was really nice in my opinion 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.400
 to 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.099
 I'll just have that three times 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.110
 same length cut off and then 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.630
 I have the whole thing with washington once 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.909
 glued on it without a class so that it is one 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.460
 holds a bit and then I have 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.530
 the glass village gives it more 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.330
 Hold and the glass I need so well 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.760
 like you, I want to make absolutely glass 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.409
 and then over the glass I have again 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.780
 given a shift week tip with it 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.340
 it really feels good that it is 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.840
 hard to explain but I think so 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.470
 You can do that through the video 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.820
 recognize 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.530
 then I have photos from my phone 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.449
 picked out and the whole stop on the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.090
 Computer arranged as I like the whole thing 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.919
 wanted and went out on photo paper and it 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.229
 is more beautiful than normal paper 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.979
 then I have the whole thing 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.780
 Cut out as best as I can 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.789
 just liked with white edges 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.919
 so it looks a bit like 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.539
 would be the whole of an instant camera 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.060
 and then I have mine too 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.130
 cool braces taken me falls grad 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.780
 Unfortunately, not the word like the hate 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.090
 yes and then it starts already the 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.430
 photos and the brackets have quite logical 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.840
 I attached this on the string 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.150
 around the bo and I think so 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.770
 really sweet from consumers are times 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.240
 then you can nails down on the 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.280
 all the jewelry in your room 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.140
 hang around somewhere that is 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.330
 just as practical and looks so great 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.670
 from I love you are like already 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.780
 mentioned and I like it so much and it 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.120
 worthwhile in any case, the 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.580
 imitate if you do something 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.860
 I would be happy as always 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.860
 somewhere to say such as on instagram 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.150
 suitable for spring slash summer 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.129
 is so soon summer I have then 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.909
 even his often wants and they are 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.909
 really great 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.120
 I have that with my mother 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.070
 sketched whole with a pencil 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.900
 so i was hanging it where a nail 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.090
 heard and it is really better if 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.470
 i delightens anyone but helps 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.080
 because then it is much easier 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.880
 then German can take your hammer 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.920
 and of course that needs now 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.750
 logically, around the nails rhine too 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.760
 beat 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.490
 I am really incapable of the hammer 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.470
 to work I once got full 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.520
 may palfinger heard and that too 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.520
 not so pleasant 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.280
 the world 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.620
 that's it finished and it looks 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.450
 just so incredibly beautiful I think 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.090
 that fits really well there he is next to 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.440
 a dressing table I hope the video 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.090
 I liked you and I would 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.290
 very happy about a thumbs up 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.290
 bye bye
