00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.760
 Although you do not believe it, I am the 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.850
 most ulcer person in the world my 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.160

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.609

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.099
 uav then I try to get the best 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.779
 version of those desserts or those 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.180
 sweet breakfasts 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.590
 that's why I bring you these warren 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 whole are super healthy and they are 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.820
 very rich we are going to see the procedure 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.610
 We are going to use half a cup of flour 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.520
 Quinoa can be almond or whole 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.380
 2 tablespoons of coconut flour if not 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.260
 have not worry, it's just a 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.600
 extra to flavor half a cup of 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.310
 almond milk skim or 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.450
 any other type of plant origin 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:05.439
 a tablespoon of chia or half flaxseed 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.250
 cup of oat flakes and two eggs or 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.250
 four clear 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.980
 let's mix these ingredients well 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.260
 I the truth is that I put everyone to the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.870
 blender - see it and chia because I 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.540
 I like it to be like the complete little eye 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.250
 but it is already a matter of likes not even 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.660
 it is so necessary to use the cnu tribulete 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.060
 the blender is can be done 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.220
 perfectly fine with a fork because 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.740
 the point is that you stay as is more and 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.510
 is thick then you are adding 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.400
 the oatmeal if you like it thicker you 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.070
 you add more oatmeal if you like more 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.860
 liquid you add more milk you can 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.050
 also put this aside from the chia if 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.050
 they do not have chia can be flaxseed and if not 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.950
 you can add vanilla tantita 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.690
 cinnamon apple slices or slices 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.340
 of banana now yes that fruit that 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.580
 you want to give that flavor to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.070
 your guajes and already later as it is well 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.490
 warm the water out then they go to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.820
 pass the masita to cold water can 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.220
 put some coconut oil 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.020
 and they are having a good time do not worry 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.120
 if it remains this mass as very uneven 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.560
 at the time it is crushed it extends 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.560
 perfectly and fits perfectly 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.120
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.610
 this recipe if you feel it like 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.010
 that very thick then it is part of the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.260
 more milk time or you can add more 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.160
 oatmeal if you like it even thicker 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.650
 you can add flaxseed or cinnamon maria 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.590
 vanilla in short you really the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.210
 can now go on improving the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.700
 but this version is a version that 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.020

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.480
