4-strand<00:00:33.840> braid<00:00:33.930> man<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.010> way<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
4-strand braid man this way it can be a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.950 
4-strand braid man this way it can be a
little<00:00:35.640> harder<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> yourself<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
little harder to do it yourself so I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590 
little harder to do it yourself so I
just<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.380> practicing<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.010> someone<00:00:38.399> else<00:00:38.600> but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
just just practicing on someone else but

just just practicing on someone else but
then<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.899> definitely<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> down

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
then you can definitely get it down

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
then you can definitely get it down
because<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.579> confusing<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.260> um

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

instead of like the you know side kind
of<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:06.659> um<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> UM<00:01:08.990> make

of look um so I'm just going to UM make
a<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.439> deep<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:11.130> part<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> lot

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
a pretty deep side part so I have a lot

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
a pretty deep side part so I have a lot
to<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.680> basically<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
to the side and then I'm basically just

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
to the side and then I'm basically just
going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.939> split<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:15.840> hair<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.350> four<00:01:16.799> equal

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
sections there's equals like Hanks

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
sections there's equals like Hanks

all<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:20.880> through<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.780> layers<00:01:22.680> um

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
all the way through because I layers um

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.340 
all the way through because I layers um
when<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.479> gonna<00:01:24.600> try<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.869> hard<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
when I'm gonna try as hard as I can to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.120 
when I'm gonna try as hard as I can to
just<00:01:25.560> create<00:01:26.659> equal<00:01:27.659> sections<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.740> wool<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
just create equal sections of wool so I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
just create equal sections of wool so I
have<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.430> four<00:01:29.700> sections<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

you over this run next to it under the
extra<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.379> then<00:02:49.650> over<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.609> ends<00:02:50.970> up<00:02:51.060> right

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
extra and then over so it ends up right

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.970 

now<00:03:06.610> why<00:03:06.820> it's<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.180> end<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:08.230> tunes<00:03:08.500> down<00:03:08.740> here

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
now why it's the end on tunes down here

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.140 
now why it's the end on tunes down here
and<00:03:09.070> bus<00:03:09.250> with<00:03:09.460> a<00:03:09.490> little<00:03:09.760> more<00:03:09.910> difficult

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
and bus with a little more difficult

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420 
and bus with a little more difficult
because<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.750> have<00:03:10.900> layered<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
because I have layered so that on the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.860 
because I have layered so that on the
same<00:03:12.640> length<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.270> I'm<00:03:13.390> at<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.630> I'll<00:03:13.720> just

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
same length but so I'm at it I'll just

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.760 
same length but so I'm at it I'll just
end<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.350> right<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:15.640> here<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.700> braids<00:03:19.770> go

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
end it right over here and the braids go

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.530 
end it right over here and the braids go
down<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.070> depth<00:03:21.250> now<00:03:21.700> as<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.880> can<00:03:22.090> see<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.300> made

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
down to depth now as you can see I made

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.020 
down to depth now as you can see I made
it<00:03:22.690> pretty<00:03:23.380> tight<00:03:23.740> so<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.760> look<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.940> little

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
it pretty tight so it can look a little

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.780 
it pretty tight so it can look a little
like<00:03:25.660> odd<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.950> I'm<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.160> going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.370> open<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.730> up

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
like odd so I'm just going to open it up

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.040 
like odd so I'm just going to open it up
a<00:03:27.910> little<00:03:28.030> bit<00:03:28.210> so<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.570> looks<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.810> little<00:03:28.900> bit

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
a little bit so it looks a little bit

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.350 
a little bit so it looks a little bit
more<00:03:29.170> natural<00:03:32.640> now<00:03:33.640> when<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:33.880> still<00:03:34.180> just

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
more natural now when you still just

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.330 
more natural now when you still just
pull<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.960> side<00:03:35.170> Bray<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.830> so<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.130> braid

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
pull the side Bray and so the braid

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.640 
pull the side Bray and so the braid
because<00:03:37.120> always<00:03:37.570> little<00:03:37.840> side<00:03:38.020> sections<00:03:38.500> I'm

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
because always little side sections I'm

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.890 
because always little side sections I'm
to<00:03:38.830> turn<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.190> towards<00:03:39.550> me<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.940> then<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.450> pull

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
to turn it towards me and then just pull

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.490 
to turn it towards me and then just pull
at<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.410> little<00:03:42.630> side<00:03:43.630> parts<00:03:43.990> the<00:03:44.080> braid<00:03:44.260> just

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
at the little side parts the braid just

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.160 
at the little side parts the braid just
to<00:03:44.590> open<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:45.040> up<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.220> little<00:03:45.340> bit<00:03:45.870> cuz<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.930> mean<00:03:47.110> it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
to open it up a little bit cuz I mean it

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.000 
to open it up a little bit cuz I mean it
pretty<00:03:47.380> tight<00:03:48.990> it<00:03:49.990> just<00:03:50.170> comes<00:03:50.290> out<00:03:50.500> really

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
pretty tight it just comes out really

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.160 
pretty tight it just comes out really
cool<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.520> don't<00:03:52.030> even<00:03:52.120> get<00:03:52.270> a<00:03:52.330> lot<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.690> comments
