00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.310
 Y 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.920
 hi bikers and bikers we are in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.290
 lanzarote testing the new ducati 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 1200 distributed a new generation of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.340
 maxi trail that takes an important jump 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.410
 qualitative in terms of technology 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:33.270
 point to the third evolution of the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.710
 multistrada 1200 brings interesting 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.379
 improvements in the main aspects 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 technicians perhaps the most relevant is the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.430
 premiere of the new testastretta dvd engine 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 acronym that refers to the double 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 varied distribution it is a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 mechanism that regulates the distribution and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.780
 which is adjusted by pressure does with 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.370
 he can vary the crossing time of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.200
 valves depending on the regime 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.550
 ensuring that the draft without user 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.620
 for the entire operating range of the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 engine on the spot the most remarkable 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.140
 is that the behavior has improved 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.430
 low revolutions 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.629
 one of the few criticisms that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.629
 they could put to previous versions 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
 the new multistrada continues to offer 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.910
 Four modes of operation though 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.010
 with a new control unit more 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.590
 modern and effective in sport modes and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.000
 touring the power is 160 horses and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.370
 the most powerful power delivery 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 being urban and enduro both with 100 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.510
 horses most suitable for rhythms 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 moderate and off road in each mode enters 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.840
 in play the traction control the anti 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 horseback and a new capable abs system 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.170
 to work in full curve all of them 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.920
 They are customizable with different 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 levels of action 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.070
 the system looks active suspensions 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 of ss that has also been reviewed 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.369
 speaking harden the hydraulics so much 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.140
 of the fork as of the shock absorber 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.990
 sachs in real time according to the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.970
 conditions of the march 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.799
 the new multistrada is a maxi trail 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.720
 of very sporty behavior although 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.399
 this does not reduce effectiveness in the most 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.630
 various scenarios is agile comfortable 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.630
 tremendously funny 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.560
 in new front not only makes it more 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.420
 Aggressive offers greater protection 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.310
 aerodynamic and as a novelty a new 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.229
 led lighting system is activated 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.650
 automatically a side light at the end 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.390
 of the curve once again the multistrada 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.280
 stands out from the competition contributing 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.570
 new technical solutions some and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.100
 never before seen in the world of 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.820
 two faces and that surely the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.820
 competition will take 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.819
 something to keep in mind is that the 17 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.849
 thousand 290 euros that the version costs 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.920
 standard and the 10 thousand 740 euros of the s 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.629
 makes it just rise in price with 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.110
 compared to the previous version see you 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.110
 The next 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.080
