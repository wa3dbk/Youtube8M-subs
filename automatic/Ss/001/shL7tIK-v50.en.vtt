00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
with us we have a bombs the most

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.720 
with us we have a bombs the most

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
respected overclockers in the indie

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.329 
respected overclockers in the indie
community<00:00:38.229> what<00:00:39.229> we're<00:00:39.440> trying<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:39.890> do<00:00:39.979> is<00:00:40.159> see

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
community what we're trying to do is see

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.060 
community what we're trying to do is see
what<00:00:40.430> we<00:00:40.550> can<00:00:40.670> do<00:00:40.760> with<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:40.970> VFX<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:42.710> question

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
what we can do with a VFX the question

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.670 
what we can do with a VFX the question
is<00:00:43.190> just<00:00:43.489> how<00:00:43.640> far<00:00:44.120> can<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:44.629> go<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.500> we're<00:00:45.589> not

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
is just how far can we go so we're not

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.960 
is just how far can we go so we're not
running<00:00:45.949> any<00:00:46.100> benchmarks<00:00:46.610> we're<00:00:46.760> just

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
running any benchmarks we're just

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.360 
running any benchmarks we're just
shooting<00:00:47.360> for<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.720> highest<00:00:48.019> cpu-z<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.250> we

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
shooting for the highest cpu-z so we

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.000 
shooting for the highest cpu-z so we
build<00:00:49.549> up<00:00:49.640> from<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.909> bias<00:00:50.089> pretty<00:00:50.809> safe<00:00:51.110> easy

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
build up from the bias pretty safe easy

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.189 
build up from the bias pretty safe easy
settings<00:00:52.549> and<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:53.000> we'll<00:00:53.720> adjust<00:00:54.019> the

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
settings and then we'll adjust the

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.899 
settings and then we'll adjust the
frequencies<00:00:54.680> on<00:00:54.799> the<00:00:54.830> fly<00:00:55.070> just<00:00:55.489> seeing<00:00:55.820> how

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
frequencies on the fly just seeing how

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.759 
frequencies on the fly just seeing how
the<00:00:55.970> frequency<00:00:56.570> scales<00:00:56.869> going<00:00:57.229> from<00:00:57.470> air

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
the frequency scales going from air

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.490 
the frequency scales going from air
water<00:00:58.040> face<00:00:58.610> slipstream<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.320> we're<00:01:00.470> just

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
water face slipstream so we're just

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.969 
water face slipstream so we're just
pulling<00:01:00.860> off<00:01:01.129> little<00:01:01.519> by<00:01:01.699> little<00:01:01.909> 7<00:01:02.299> gigahertz

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
pulling off little by little 7 gigahertz

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.170 
pulling off little by little 7 gigahertz
so<00:01:03.979> far<00:01:04.220> no<00:01:04.879> problem<00:01:06.340> these<00:01:07.340> days<00:01:07.610> we've<00:01:07.850> kind

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
so far no problem these days we've kind

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.550 
so far no problem these days we've kind
of<00:01:08.360> stepped<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.899> up<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.140> bit

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
of stepped it up a bit

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.950 
of stepped it up a bit
when<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.399> run<00:01:10.520> liquid<00:01:10.850> nitrogen<00:01:11.180> it's<00:01:11.659> kind<00:01:11.930> of

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
when we run liquid nitrogen it's kind of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.870 
when we run liquid nitrogen it's kind of
a<00:01:12.020> preliminary<00:01:12.320> test<00:01:12.710> for<00:01:12.979> us<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:13.700> been

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
a preliminary test for us and it's been

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.310 
a preliminary test for us and it's been
overclocking<00:01:14.509> for<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.750> rest<00:01:14.899> of<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.109> world

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
overclocking for the rest of the world

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.690 
overclocking for the rest of the world
for<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.590> long<00:01:15.710> time<00:01:15.979> 7<00:01:16.549> 873<00:01:17.500> hitting<00:01:18.500> any<00:01:19.219> notion

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
for a long time 7 873 hitting any notion

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.890 
for a long time 7 873 hitting any notion
of<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.820> HD<00:01:20.210> arts<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.899> caterers

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.560 

when<00:01:29.500> we<00:01:29.620> switch<00:01:29.860> over<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> helium<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:31.090> base

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
when we switch over to helium the base

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.480 
when we switch over to helium the base
temperature<00:01:32.170> has<00:01:32.560> usually<00:01:32.740> been<00:01:32.950> between

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
temperature has usually been between

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
temperature has usually been between
negative<00:01:33.930> 220<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.110> 230

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
negative 220 and 230

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.170

8.33<00:01:37.810> 5<00:01:38.140> megahertz<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.190> was<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.940> highest

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
8.33 5 megahertz that was the highest

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.440 
8.33 5 megahertz that was the highest
CPU<00:01:40.930> frequency<00:01:41.170> ever<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.820> had<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.240> wire

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
CPU frequency ever and we had the wire

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.660 
CPU frequency ever and we had the wire
scanner<00:01:43.960> enabled<00:01:44.560> let's<00:01:44.890> see<00:01:45.070> if<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.370> can<00:01:45.550> go

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
scanner enabled let's see if we can go

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
scanner enabled let's see if we can go
higher<00:01:49.410> so<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:50.560> would<00:01:50.740> be<00:01:50.890> 8<00:01:51.100> 420<00:01:52.090> we<00:01:52.570> can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
higher so this would be 8 420 we can

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.750 
higher so this would be 8 420 we can
make<00:01:52.870> it<00:01:53.610> 8429

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.020 

congratulations<00:01:57.760> everyone<00:01:58.240> an<00:01:58.450> awesome
