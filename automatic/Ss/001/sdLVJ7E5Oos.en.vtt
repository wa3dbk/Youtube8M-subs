home<00:00:43.840> made<00:00:44.230> amplifier<00:00:45.100> I<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:47.079> I<00:00:47.350> know<00:00:47.739> it's<00:00:48.489> a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
home made amplifier I know I know it's a

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.579 
home made amplifier I know I know it's a
pretty<00:00:48.970> interesting<00:00:49.329> and<00:00:49.960> pretty<00:00:50.199> funny

pretty interesting and pretty funny

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.240 
pretty interesting and pretty funny
construction<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:52.449> today<00:00:53.260> I'm<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.920> take

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
construction but today I'm going to take

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.259 
construction but today I'm going to take
this<00:00:54.579> apart<00:00:55.030> because<00:00:55.750> I<00:00:56.290> just<00:00:57.129> don't<00:00:57.610> want<00:00:58.059> to

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
this apart because I just don't want to

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.400 
this apart because I just don't want to
keep<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.760> speaker<00:01:01.089> has<00:01:01.479> just<00:01:01.899> been<00:01:02.140> taken

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
keep it the speaker has just been taken

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.350 
keep it the speaker has just been taken
out<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:04.770> after<00:01:05.770> taking<00:01:06.220> out<00:01:06.490> all<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.970> damping

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
out and after taking out all the damping

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.320 
out and after taking out all the damping
material<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:09.220> can<00:01:09.399> take<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.970> last<00:01:10.509> look<00:01:10.840> inside

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.230 

after<00:01:16.330> taking<00:01:16.570> out<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.869> bunch<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.440> screws<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.310> was

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
after taking out a bunch of screws I was

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.320 
after taking out a bunch of screws I was
able<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.690> take<00:01:19.929> out<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.380> weird<00:01:20.860> hiss<00:01:21.429> filter

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
able to take out that weird hiss filter

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.430 
able to take out that weird hiss filter
and<00:01:23.880> now<00:01:24.880> we<00:01:24.940> can<00:01:25.360> take<00:01:25.539> out<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.990> speaker

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
and now we can take out the speaker

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.980 
and now we can take out the speaker
terminal<00:01:27.009> which<00:01:27.880> used<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.390> connect<00:01:28.810> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
terminal which used to connect the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.040 
terminal which used to connect the
second<00:01:29.440> speaker<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.159> amplifier<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.119> it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
second speaker to the amplifier and it

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.690 
second speaker to the amplifier and it
also<00:01:32.259> contained<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.220> weird<00:01:33.939> switch<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:35.700> don't

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
also contained a weird switch I don't

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.170 
also contained a weird switch I don't
know<00:01:36.850> what<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.090> does<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:39.430> also<00:01:39.640> has<00:01:39.939> a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
know what that does and it also has a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.840 
know what that does and it also has a
hole<00:01:40.540> with<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.049> wire<00:01:41.380> with<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.040> power<00:01:42.310> from<00:01:42.700> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
hole with a wire with the power from the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.889 
hole with a wire with the power from the
power<00:01:42.880> supply<00:01:43.619> went<00:01:44.619> through<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
power supply went through and the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.569 
power supply went through and the
speaker<00:01:47.200> terminal<00:01:48.719> taken<00:01:49.719> out<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:51.189> even<00:01:51.549> comes

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
speaker terminal taken out it even comes

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.010 
speaker terminal taken out it even comes
with<00:01:51.969> a<00:01:52.149> little<00:01:52.570> rubber<00:01:53.290> part<00:01:53.969> for<00:01:55.020> better

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
with a little rubber part for better

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
with a little rubber part for better
insulation<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.920> input<00:02:00.460> RCA<00:02:01.390> jacks<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
insulation and the input RCA jacks and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.770 
insulation and the input RCA jacks and
here<00:02:04.719> it<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:04.979> taken<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.159> as<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.539> see

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
here it is taken out as you can see

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.940 
here it is taken out as you can see
whoever<00:02:08.619> built<00:02:09.160> this<00:02:09.429> thing<00:02:09.789> used<00:02:10.950> something

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
whoever built this thing used something

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.620 
whoever built this thing used something
to<00:02:12.430> insulate<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:14.820> really<00:02:15.820> looks<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.180> little<00:02:16.359> bit

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
to insulate it really looks a little bit

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.770 
to insulate it really looks a little bit
like<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.709> stuff<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.549> usually<00:02:18.970> put<00:02:19.420> into<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
like the stuff you usually put into a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.630 
like the stuff you usually put into a
heat<00:02:20.079> sink<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:22.690> unfortunately<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:24.130> person

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
heat sink now unfortunately the person

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.449 
heat sink now unfortunately the person
who<00:02:24.760> built<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.239> also<00:02:25.540> insulated<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.040> second

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
who built this also insulated the second

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.990 
who built this also insulated the second
pair<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.910> RCA<00:02:28.359> jacks<00:02:29.250> as<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.519> see<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.760> this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
pair of RCA jacks as you can see on this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.960 
pair of RCA jacks as you can see on this
side<00:02:31.299> we<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.660> lot<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.470> solder<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.340> top<00:02:33.640> on

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
side we have a lot of solder on top on

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.250 
side we have a lot of solder on top on
this<00:02:34.600> side<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.109> plastic<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.709> melted<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.260> well

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
this side the plastic is melted so well

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.920 
this side the plastic is melted so well
you<00:02:39.070> really<00:02:39.310> can't<00:02:39.459> use<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.209> thing<00:02:40.239> anymore

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.910 

I'll<00:02:43.230> take<00:02:43.500> out<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:44.599> part<00:02:45.599> here<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.829> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
I'll take out this part here so that I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.830 
I'll take out this part here so that I
can<00:02:46.980> reach<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.640> screws<00:02:48.000> which<00:02:48.329> are<00:02:48.510> holding

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
can reach the screws which are holding

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.819 
can reach the screws which are holding
the<00:02:48.930> preamplifier<00:02:49.379> in<00:02:49.980> its<00:02:50.129> place<00:02:50.400> as<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:52.680> can

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
the preamplifier in its place as you can

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.670 
the preamplifier in its place as you can
see<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.310> part<00:02:53.760> was<00:02:54.030> hold<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.510> place<00:02:54.810> by<00:02:55.290> some

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
see this part was hold in place by some

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.330 
see this part was hold in place by some
sort<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.340> really<00:02:56.819> really<00:02:57.000> sticky<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:58.340> tape

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
sort of a really really sticky of tape

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.750 
sort of a really really sticky of tape
here<00:03:01.879> but<00:03:02.879> now<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.510> take<00:03:03.719> out<00:03:03.900> these<00:03:04.170> screws

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
here but now I can take out these screws

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.309 
here but now I can take out these screws
to<00:03:05.760> take<00:03:05.969> out<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.299> preamplifier<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:09.200> here<00:03:10.200> we

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
to take out the preamplifier and here we

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.039 
to take out the preamplifier and here we

this kit oh now I have this kit already
assembled<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.629> try<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.959> out<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.519> well<00:03:29.519> if

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
assembled I can try it out and well if

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.990 
assembled I can try it out and well if
it<00:03:30.090> works<00:03:30.329> good<00:03:30.689> if<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.019> sounds<00:03:31.439> good<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:32.000> think

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
it works good if it sounds good I think

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.559 
it works good if it sounds good I think
I'll<00:03:33.150> buy<00:03:33.329> another<00:03:33.689> one<00:03:33.959> now<00:03:34.859> this

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
I'll buy another one now this

integrated circuit it amplifies the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.270 
integrated circuit it amplifies the
signal<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.909> it<00:03:48.720> regulates<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:50.120> volume<00:03:51.260> base

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
signal and it regulates the volume base

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.210 
signal and it regulates the volume base
rubble<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.489> balance<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:55.260> works<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.889> all

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
rubble and balance and it works it's all

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.879 
rubble and balance and it works it's all
done<00:03:56.729> inside<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.449> same<00:03:57.659> integrated<00:03:58.319> circuit

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
done inside the same integrated circuit

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.059 
done inside the same integrated circuit
so<00:03:59.639> if<00:04:00.329> like<00:04:00.810> for<00:04:01.019> example<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.680> volume

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
so if like for example the volume

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.089 
so if like for example the volume
potentiometer<00:04:02.189> gets<00:04:03.060> dirty<00:04:03.659> you<00:04:04.019> won't<00:04:04.709> have

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
potentiometer gets dirty you won't have

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.689 
potentiometer gets dirty you won't have
