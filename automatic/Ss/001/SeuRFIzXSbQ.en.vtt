00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.559 

I<00:00:03.060> made<00:00:04.060> some<00:00:04.090> wings<00:00:04.569> for<00:00:04.720> my<00:00:05.140> six<00:00:06.069> coil

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I made some wings for my six coil

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.980 
I made some wings for my six coil
exo-flex<00:00:08.100> alternator<00:00:09.100> and<00:00:09.400> I'm<00:00:10.360> trying<00:00:10.809> it

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
exo-flex alternator and I'm trying it

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.080 
exo-flex alternator and I'm trying it
out<00:00:11.170> inside<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:14.290> a<00:00:14.320> fan<00:00:14.650> so<00:00:15.040> I<00:00:15.070> can<00:00:15.490> adjust

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
out inside with a fan so I can adjust

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.400 
out inside with a fan so I can adjust
the<00:00:16.360> angle<00:00:17.610> should<00:00:18.610> be<00:00:18.790> about<00:00:19.000> nine<00:00:19.989> degrees

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the angle should be about nine degrees

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.630 
the angle should be about nine degrees
but<00:00:23.410> whenever<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.480> adjusted<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:26.520> there's<00:00:27.520> a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
but whenever I adjusted the there's a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.709 
but whenever I adjusted the there's a
slight<00:00:27.880> difference<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:30.419> let's<00:00:31.419> see<00:00:31.570> how<00:00:31.599> it

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:31.719 
slight difference so let's see how it

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:40.100 
slight difference so let's see how it
goes<00:00:31.869> here

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.310 

you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.130> see<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.790> speed<00:00:42.510> picking<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:45.320> I'm

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you can see the speed picking up I'm

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.720 
you can see the speed picking up I'm
getting<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.920> 16<00:00:47.460> folks<00:00:48.240> or<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:50.960> likes<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
getting like 16 folks or so likes of

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.910 
getting like 16 folks or so likes of
this<00:00:53.730> bunch<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.270> led

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.740 

I<00:01:01.170> install<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.410> magnets<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.750> second

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
I install the magnets to the second

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:16.730 
I install the magnets to the second
rotor<00:01:05.560> on<00:01:05.950> top<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:13.170> gap<00:01:14.170> for<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.740> top<00:01:15.520> rotor

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
rotor on top the gap for the top rotor

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.480 
rotor on top the gap for the top rotor
to<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> stator<00:01:18.190> is<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.270> bitwise<00:01:19.750> but<00:01:20.590> almost

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
to the stator is the bitwise but almost

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.840 
to the stator is the bitwise but almost
like<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.759> quarter<00:01:22.420> inch<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.680> bottom<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
like a quarter inch in the bottom the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.990 
like a quarter inch in the bottom the
bottom<00:01:25.060> plate<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.899> maybe<00:01:26.619> about<00:01:26.950> an<00:01:27.250> eighth<00:01:27.789> of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
bottom plate is maybe about an eighth of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.600 
bottom plate is maybe about an eighth of
an<00:01:28.180> inch<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.439> stator<00:01:31.590> i'm<00:01:32.590> using<00:01:33.220> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
an inch to the stator i'm using a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.279 
an inch to the stator i'm using a
bicycle<00:01:34.270> rack<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:34.750> i<00:01:35.700> clamped<00:01:36.700> together<00:01:36.819> to<00:01:37.810> a

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
bicycle rack so i clamped together to a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.899 
bicycle rack so i clamped together to a
couple<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.920> two-by-fours

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.370 

so<00:01:45.539> I<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.289> put<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.039> outside<00:01:47.659> when<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.079> have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so I will put this outside when I have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.190 
so I will put this outside when I have
when<00:01:49.679> now<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.249> a<00:01:50.850> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> speed<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.920> get

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
when now see a kind of speed I will get

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.370 
when now see a kind of speed I will get
when<00:01:55.200> i<00:01:55.229> turn<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.799> by<00:01:56.490> hand<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:57.090> goes<00:01:57.569> faster

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
when i turn it by hand it goes faster

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:27.569 
when i turn it by hand it goes faster
that<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.219> without<00:01:59.459> the<00:01:59.670> wings

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.680 

okay<00:02:29.079> thanks<00:02:30.079> for<00:02:30.290> watching
