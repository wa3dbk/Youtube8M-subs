deserves a rematch automatically I think
that<00:04:16.500> most<00:04:16.859> people<00:04:17.220> have<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.760> look<00:04:17.910> at<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
that most people have to look at the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.640 
that most people have to look at the
first<00:04:18.269> fight<00:04:18.540> though<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.750> mean<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.350> me<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.560> was

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
first fight though I mean to me it was

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.170 
first fight though I mean to me it was
not<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.859> very<00:04:19.980> contrary<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.670> was<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.820> one-sided

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
not a very contrary it was a one-sided

fight<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.200> thought<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.530> guess<00:04:23.370> his<00:04:23.550> burrow<00:04:23.790> and

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180

getting<00:04:51.750> stopped<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:52.350> there<00:04:52.470> are<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.620> whole

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
getting stopped and so there are a whole

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.100 
getting stopped and so there are a whole
bunch<00:04:52.890> of<00:04:53.220> other<00:04:53.280> factors<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.090> think<00:04:54.390> I'm

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
bunch of other factors and I think I'm

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.110 
bunch of other factors and I think I'm
not<00:04:55.260> saying<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.620> if<00:04:55.950> Sergio<00:04:56.460> one<00:04:56.820> and

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
not saying that if Sergio one and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.300 
not saying that if Sergio one and
Anthony<00:04:57.930> Pettis<00:04:58.110> didn't<00:04:58.500> get<00:04:58.620> hit<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.160> he

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
Anthony Pettis didn't get hit that he

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.100 
Anthony Pettis didn't get hit that he
would<00:04:59.460> have<00:04:59.550> won<00:04:59.700> that<00:04:59.730> that<00:05:00.330> fight<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:01.050> the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
would have won that that fight but the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.990 
would have won that that fight but the
fact<00:05:01.350> is<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.530> Anthony<00:05:02.040> Pettis<00:05:02.220> has<00:05:02.460> done<00:05:02.700> so

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
fact is that Anthony Pettis has done so

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.810 
fact is that Anthony Pettis has done so
much<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.419> this<00:05:03.540> weather<00:05:04.080> being<00:05:04.740> in<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> WEC<00:05:05.580> or

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
much of this weather being in the WEC or

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.850 
much of this weather being in the WEC or
the<00:05:05.970> UFC<00:05:06.360> like<00:05:06.690> lightweight<00:05:07.229> champion<00:05:07.710> I

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
the UFC like lightweight champion I

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.100 
the UFC like lightweight champion I
think<00:05:08.370> that<00:05:08.550> warrants<00:05:08.970> an<00:05:09.120> automatic<00:05:09.750> rematch

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
think that warrants an automatic rematch

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.500 
think that warrants an automatic rematch
against<00:05:10.530> rafael<00:05:10.950> dos<00:05:11.190> anos<00:05:11.400> yeah<00:05:11.729> miles<00:05:12.090> jury

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.540 
against rafael dos anos yeah miles jury
is<00:05:12.840> going<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.200> really<00:05:13.410> like<00:05:13.650> this<00:05:13.860> opportunity

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
is going to really like this opportunity

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.050 
is going to really like this opportunity
because<00:05:14.580> he<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.270> faced<00:05:15.630> cowboy<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.919> lost<00:05:17.669> in

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
because he just faced cowboy and lost in

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.420 
because he just faced cowboy and lost in
a<00:05:18.390> very<00:05:18.840> important<00:05:19.380> fight<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:19.830> him<00:05:19.979> if<00:05:20.100> you<00:05:20.220> go

a very important fight for him if you go

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.580 
a very important fight for him if you go

in as an undefeated 15 and 0 guy get

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.590 
in as an undefeated 15 and 0 guy get
through<00:05:22.620> cowboy<00:05:23.250> were<00:05:23.700> like<00:05:23.820> oh<00:05:23.970> my<00:05:24.150> god<00:05:24.360> this

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.380 
through cowboy were like oh my god this
is<00:05:25.260> like<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.590> do-over<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.310> even<00:05:26.729> higher<00:05:27.000> due

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
is like a do-over and even higher due

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.270 
is like a do-over and even higher due
over<00:05:27.540> against<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.140> guy<00:05:28.260> coming<00:05:28.650> off<00:05:28.770> surgery

over against the guy coming off surgery

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.920 
over against the guy coming off surgery
for<00:05:29.520> an<00:05:29.580> orbital<00:05:29.940> bone<00:05:30.120> all<00:05:30.450> that<00:05:30.720> kind<00:05:30.900> of

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
for an orbital bone all that kind of

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.390 
for an orbital bone all that kind of
such<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.200> great<00:05:31.350> opportunity<00:05:31.620> for<00:05:31.890> him<00:05:32.010> as<00:05:32.190> a

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
such a great opportunity for him as a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.310 
such a great opportunity for him as a
style<00:05:32.910> matchup<00:05:33.539> and

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
style matchup and

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.110 
style matchup and
me<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.710> Duke<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.400> his<00:05:35.460> whole<00:05:35.640> team<00:05:35.850> will

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
me and Duke and his whole team will

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.910 
me and Duke and his whole team will
think<00:05:36.330> this<00:05:36.510> is<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.690> great<00:05:36.900> style<00:05:37.260> matchup<00:05:37.710> I

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
think this is a great style matchup I

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.340 
think this is a great style matchup I
think<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:38.910> possibly<00:05:39.720> easy<00:05:40.050> to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
think it is possibly easy to

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.650 
think it is possibly easy to
underestimate<00:05:40.650> miles<00:05:41.220> Jerry<00:05:41.610> by<00:05:42.000> no<00:05:42.060> means

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
underestimate miles Jerry by no means

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.210 
underestimate miles Jerry by no means
should<00:05:42.900> they<00:05:43.050> go<00:05:43.200> in<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:43.470> assume<00:05:43.770> this<00:05:43.980> is<00:05:44.040> a

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
should they go in and assume this is a

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.580 
should they go in and assume this is a
walk<00:05:44.490> he<00:05:44.910> has<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.420> come<00:05:45.570> in<00:05:45.630> more<00:05:46.200> prepared

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
walk he has to come in more prepared

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.890 
walk he has to come in more prepared
more<00:05:46.860> focused<00:05:47.340> than<00:05:47.520> he<00:05:47.820> ever<00:05:47.940> had<00:05:48.210> which<00:05:48.720> he

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
more focused than he ever had which he

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.930 
more focused than he ever had which he
will<00:05:49.080> be<00:05:49.230> and<00:05:49.440> really<00:05:50.100> make<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> statement<00:05:50.580> you

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
will be and really make a statement you

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.480 
will be and really make a statement you
can't<00:05:51.210> do<00:05:51.420> 20<00:05:51.810> 25<00:05:52.470> minutes<00:05:52.710> with<00:05:52.980> Jerry<00:05:53.280> and

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
can't do 20 25 minutes with Jerry and

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.490 
can't do 20 25 minutes with Jerry and
win<00:05:54.000> three<00:05:54.300> rounds<00:05:54.660> you<00:05:54.750> got<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:55.020> go<00:05:55.110> in<00:05:55.140> there

to be happening Matt Brown and Nate Diaz

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.910 
to be happening Matt Brown and Nate Diaz
this<00:06:02.490> was<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.910> very<00:06:03.270> strange<00:06:03.720> one<00:06:03.960> because<00:06:04.350> the

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
this was a very strange one because the

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.890 
this was a very strange one because the
UFC<00:06:05.400> had<00:06:05.730> confirmed<00:06:06.210> that<00:06:06.420> this<00:06:06.540> fight<00:06:06.780> was

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
UFC had confirmed that this fight was

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.450 
UFC had confirmed that this fight was
happening<00:06:07.440> Nate<00:06:07.620> Diaz<00:06:07.800> comes<00:06:08.070> back<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.400> say

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
happening Nate Diaz comes back and say

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.280 
happening Nate Diaz comes back and say
they<00:06:09.030> didn't<00:06:09.270> even<00:06:09.330> contact<00:06:09.600> me<00:06:09.960> about<00:06:10.050> this

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
they didn't even contact me about this

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.110 
they didn't even contact me about this
fight<00:06:10.500> truth<00:06:10.950> probably<00:06:11.280> somewhere<00:06:11.880> in<00:06:11.940> the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
fight truth probably somewhere in the

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600 
fight truth probably somewhere in the
middle<00:06:12.450> as<00:06:12.570> they<00:06:12.720> typically<00:06:13.200> are<00:06:13.230> but<00:06:13.950> this<00:06:14.490> is

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
middle as they typically are but this is

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.760 
middle as they typically are but this is
a<00:06:14.640> fight<00:06:14.850> I<00:06:14.880> can't<00:06:15.510> say<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.990> would<00:06:16.530> have<00:06:16.650> been<00:06:16.710> a

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
a fight I can't say it would have been a

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.470 
a fight I can't say it would have been a
super<00:06:17.130> fun<00:06:17.310> fight<00:06:17.580> to<00:06:17.730> watch<00:06:17.850> but<00:06:18.180> i<00:06:18.420> believe

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
super fun fight to watch but i believe

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.660 
super fun fight to watch but i believe
that<00:06:18.750> Nate<00:06:19.020> Diaz<00:06:19.200> should<00:06:19.440> be<00:06:19.530> fighting<00:06:19.860> at<00:06:19.950> 155

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
that Nate Diaz should be fighting at 155

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.220 
that Nate Diaz should be fighting at 155
pounds<00:06:20.940> I<00:06:21.210> think<00:06:21.480> it<00:06:21.570> would<00:06:21.720> have<00:06:21.840> been<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.990> fun

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
pounds I think it would have been a fun

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.690 
pounds I think it would have been a fun
flight<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.500> think<00:06:22.830> it<00:06:22.950> would<00:06:23.340> have<00:06:23.430> been<00:06:23.490> some

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
flight I think it would have been some

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.030 
flight I think it would have been some
serious<00:06:23.940> carnage<00:06:24.480> and<00:06:24.900> who<00:06:25.500> knows<00:06:25.650> i<00:06:25.890> think

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
serious carnage and who knows i think

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.290 
serious carnage and who knows i think
most<00:06:26.190> people<00:06:26.430> are<00:06:26.490> probably<00:06:26.640> picking<00:06:27.000> Matt

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
most people are probably picking Matt

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.090 
most people are probably picking Matt
Brown<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.690> win<00:06:27.810> this<00:06:27.960> fight<00:06:28.200> just<00:06:28.680> because<00:06:28.980> of

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
Brown to win this fight just because of

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.880 
Brown to win this fight just because of
his<00:06:29.250> physical<00:06:29.880> superiority<00:06:30.350> but<00:06:31.350> I<00:06:31.410> think

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
his physical superiority but I think

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.290 
his physical superiority but I think
you're<00:06:32.010> right<00:06:32.190> i<00:06:32.250> think<00:06:32.370> Nathan<00:06:32.820> Diaz<00:06:33.060> his

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
you're right i think Nathan Diaz his

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.560 
you're right i think Nathan Diaz his
best<00:06:33.540> fights<00:06:33.870> are<00:06:34.200> at<00:06:34.530> 155<00:06:35.370> pounds<00:06:35.670> or<00:06:35.970> give

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
best fights are at 155 pounds or give

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.410 
best fights are at 155 pounds or give
him<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.990> right<00:06:37.020> fights<00:06:37.650> at<00:06:37.890> 175<00:06:38.850> this<00:06:39.060> whole

him the right fights at 175 this whole

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.270 
him the right fights at 175 this whole
scenario<00:06:39.660> is<00:06:39.990> kind<00:06:40.230> of<00:06:40.320> easy<00:06:40.560> to<00:06:40.860> understand

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280
