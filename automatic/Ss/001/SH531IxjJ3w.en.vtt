00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
smoked pot as a kid and I view it as a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.250 
smoked pot as a kid and I view it as a
bad<00:00:23.189> habit<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.699> advice<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.869> different

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
bad habit and advice not very different

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.570 
bad habit and advice not very different
from<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> cigarettes<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.099> smoked<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
from the cigarettes that I smoked as a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.160 
from the cigarettes that I smoked as a
young<00:00:26.789> person<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.390> through<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> big<00:00:27.810> chunk<00:00:28.080> of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
young person up through a big chunk of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
young person up through a big chunk of
my<00:00:28.320> adult<00:00:28.590> life<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.070> don't<00:00:29.400> think<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.910> more

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
my adult life I don't think it is more

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.700 
my adult life I don't think it is more
dangerous<00:00:30.300> than<00:00:30.840> alcohol

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
dangerous than alcohol

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.150 
dangerous than alcohol
so<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:33.079> obvious<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.800> good<00:00:34.950> sign<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so that's obvious and a good sign that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.119 
so that's obvious and a good sign that
he's<00:00:35.370> recognizing<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.149> obvious<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:37.559> yeah

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
he's recognizing the obvious so yeah

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.979 
he's recognizing the obvious so yeah
we're<00:00:38.340> making<00:00:38.460> progress<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.390> Bush<00:00:39.629> used<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
we're making progress as Bush used to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
we're making progress as Bush used to
say<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:41.160> happy<00:00:41.760> about<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.390> big

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
say so I'm happy about that it's a big

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
say so I'm happy about that it's a big
deal<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.590> lifetime<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
deal that in my lifetime we have a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.369 
deal that in my lifetime we have a
president<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> United<00:00:45.719> States<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.050> America

Hey and it looks like it moves people to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 
Hey and it looks like it moves people to
some<00:01:51.479> extent<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.110> hopefully<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.100> as

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
some extent and hopefully this will as

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.630 
some extent and hopefully this will as
well

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
well

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.270 
well
yeah<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.360> Obama's<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> leader<00:01:55.649> he's<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
yeah and Obama's not a leader he's a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609 
yeah and Obama's not a leader he's a
politician<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.360> hence<00:01:57.659> he's<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> follower<00:01:58.290> but

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
politician and hence he's a follower but

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.639 
politician and hence he's a follower but
once<00:01:59.579> he<00:01:59.909> gets<00:02:00.119> ahead<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.750> Train<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.469> now

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
once he gets ahead of the Train like now

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.749 
once he gets ahead of the Train like now
the<00:02:01.710> train<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> headed<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.640> direction

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the train is headed in that direction

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.480 
the train is headed in that direction
and<00:02:03.450> he<00:02:03.719> jumps<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.229> board<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.710> does<00:02:05.159> give<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and he jumps on board it does give the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
and he jumps on board it does give the
Train<00:02:05.729> momentum<00:02:06.270> yeah<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:06.960> why<00:02:07.110> it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
Train momentum yeah so that's why it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.859 
Train momentum yeah so that's why it's

folks who are writing those laws have

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.390 
folks who are writing those laws have
probably<00:02:26.269> done<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.569> same<00:02:26.930> thing<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.950> he<00:02:28.099> seems

probably done the same thing so he seems
to<00:02:28.579> at<00:02:28.670> least<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:29.150> self-aware<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
to at least be self-aware of the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.259 
to at least be self-aware of the
hypocrisy<00:02:30.620> from<00:02:30.799> some<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.219> his<00:02:31.269> previous

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
hypocrisy from some of his previous

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.259 
hypocrisy from some of his previous
actions<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:33.109> I<00:02:33.139> look<00:02:33.680> I'm<00:02:34.129> slightly<00:02:34.909> torn<00:02:35.150> on

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
actions so I look I'm slightly torn on

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.089 
actions so I look I'm slightly torn on
that<00:02:35.389> cuz<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.780> actually<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.079> love<00:02:36.379> that<00:02:36.620> quote<00:02:36.889> I
