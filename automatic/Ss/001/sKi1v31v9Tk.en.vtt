00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
so this is telescope now I go to object

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
so this is telescope now I go to object

extrude it go to bond properties and I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.370 
extrude it go to bond properties and I
will<00:00:51.690> give<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> name<00:00:53.600> not<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.870> bone<00:00:55.110> will

bones<00:01:17.179> should<00:01:18.179> be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.620 

and<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:25.670> very<00:01:26.030> important<00:01:27.100> where<00:01:28.100> our

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
and is very important where our

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.170 
and is very important where our
disappoints<00:01:29.630> located<00:01:30.460> fused<00:01:31.460> cards<00:01:31.820> must<00:01:32.060> be

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
disappoints located fused cards must be

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
disappoints located fused cards must be
located<00:01:32.710> what<00:01:33.710> match<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.130> beginning<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:35.200> the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
located what match is beginning and the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.590 
located what match is beginning and the
last<00:01:36.440> cards<00:01:36.860> must<00:01:37.100> be<00:01:37.250> located<00:01:37.520> where<00:01:37.880> much<00:01:38.420> is

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
last cards must be located where much is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.480 
last cards must be located where much is
ending<00:01:39.640> also<00:01:40.640> important<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.190> has

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
ending also important is what this has

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.230 
ending also important is what this has
advocated<00:01:44.770> because<00:01:45.770> these<00:01:46.370> does<00:01:46.670> must<00:01:47.090> be

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
advocated because these does must be

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.400 
advocated because these does must be
still<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.630> same<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:50.180> make<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.840> right

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
still the same and to make this right

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.609 
still the same and to make this right
I<00:01:51.440> must<00:01:51.740> know<00:01:51.950> how<00:01:52.610> long<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.180> match<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.660> this

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
I must know how long this match is this

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.480 
I must know how long this match is this
match<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:57.970> 122.8<00:01:58.970> blender<00:01:59.390> unit<00:01:59.810> and

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
match is so 122.8 blender unit and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.419 
match is so 122.8 blender unit and
select<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:06.040> go<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.100> hurt<00:02:07.570> go<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.990> and

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
select this go to hurt go to that and

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.060 
select this go to hurt go to that and
2.8<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.759> must<00:02:11.480> divide<00:02:11.870> by<00:02:12.140> number<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.740> aunty

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
2.8 I must divide by number of aunty

2.8 I must divide by number of aunty
spices<00:02:13.600> one<00:02:14.600> two<00:02:15.760> three<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.970> four<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.600> divide

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
spices one two three and four so divide

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.090 
spices one two three and four so divide

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.070 
select fields cube
I<00:04:24.460> made<00:04:25.460> this<00:04:25.729> by<00:04:26.080> okay

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
I made this by okay

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.520 
I made this by okay
go<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.199> this<00:04:30.470> panel<00:04:31.240> go<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.300> vertex<00:04:32.660> groups<00:04:33.199> and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
go to this panel go to vertex groups and

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:56.200 
go to this panel go to vertex groups and
select<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.650> press<00:04:36.650> assign<00:04:39.430> I'll<00:04:42.070> assign

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.570 

okay<00:04:57.210> go<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:57.570> object<00:04:58.470> mode<00:04:58.770> go<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.190> pose<00:04:59.580> mode

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
okay go to object mode go to pose mode

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.830 
okay go to object mode go to pose mode
and<00:05:02.580> now<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:04.530> can<00:05:04.770> see<00:05:05.010> that<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.690> working

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.280 

I<00:05:09.900> can<00:05:10.590> limit<00:05:10.800> distance<00:05:11.370> if<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.360> want<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.810> avoid

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
I can limit distance if I want to avoid

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.260 
I can limit distance if I want to avoid
situation<00:05:13.920> like<00:05:14.130> this<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:16.770> must<00:05:17.280> move<00:05:17.460> this

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
situation like this so I must move this

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.940 
situation like this so I must move this
to<00:05:18.420> maximum<00:05:18.960> distance<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.590> go<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:19.890> constraint

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
to maximum distance and go to constraint

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
to maximum distance and go to constraint
and<00:05:22.950> out<00:05:23.220> limit<00:05:24.090> distance<00:05:25.820> target<00:05:26.820> is

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
and out limit distance target is

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.620 
and out limit distance target is
armature<00:05:27.480> again<00:05:28.220> this<00:05:29.220> time<00:05:29.490> this<00:05:29.940> big<00:05:30.210> one

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.480 

and<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:34.500> move<00:05:34.740> this<00:05:34.950> down<00:05:35.900> but<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:37.260> can<00:05:38.130> move<00:05:38.280> this

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
and I move this down but I can move this

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:47.090 
and I move this down but I can move this
up<00:05:42.050> also<00:05:43.050> I<00:05:43.560> can<00:05:43.980> limit<00:05:44.990> movie<00:05:45.990> on<00:05:46.410> left<00:05:46.890> or

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
up also I can limit movie on left or

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.450 
up also I can limit movie on left or
right<00:05:47.310> side<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:48.390> make<00:05:48.570> this<00:05:49.460> another

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
right side and to make this another

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.460 
right side and to make this another
constraint<00:05:51.120> which<00:05:51.360> is<00:05:51.570> called<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:52.050> limit

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
constraint which is called a limit

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.820 
constraint which is called a limit
location<00:05:55.460> first<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:56.610> must<00:05:56.760> change<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.330> to

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
location first I must change this to

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.280 
location first I must change this to
local<00:05:58.830> space<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:02.400> I<00:06:02.730> must<00:06:03.000> set<00:06:03.270> our<00:06:03.570> limits<00:06:03.870> on

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
local space and I must set our limits on

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:11.510 
local space and I must set our limits on
X<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:04.920> z<00:06:05.610> axis

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.090 

so<00:06:12.520> this<00:06:12.910> is<00:06:13.090> everything<00:06:13.920> thanks<00:06:14.920> for

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
so this is everything thanks for

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:23.550 
so this is everything thanks for
watching

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.620 

you
