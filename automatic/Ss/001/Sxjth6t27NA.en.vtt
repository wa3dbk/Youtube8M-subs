00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 oh yes, there are people , too 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.640
 really strange questions though 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.640
 answer exactly in front of your eyes 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.040
 but what the people my name is love 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.750
 Boerne and in this video I want one 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.700
 few things to me in recent times 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 really made you think 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.840
 and the first thing that really does me 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.309
 that made me think 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.260
 extremely many people wish that on 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.820
 best every day a video comes from me 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 and do not even consider it 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.610
 that the quality and the length of the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.309
 videos suffer from it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.080
 that is true but I think there is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.220
 enough other people really horny 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.260
 make quite a performance among others 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.090
 also very tesco with which you necessarily 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.469
 but should stop by after me 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.910
 now enough advertising were the youtubers 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.520
 I have come to the facts 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.750
 which I want to mention I have to admit 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.789
 the few videos I ever had 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 I did not always produce with pleasure and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.730
 whims have arisen 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.100
 because sometimes I have to admit that I am 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 had some boredom and she thought 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 to combine with me and invites you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.039
 video high after that have worked 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.080
 but then there are still the videos 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.640
 really created with such a lust 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 are where I just had the desire 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.509
 jenaer to fool or to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.369
 provoke and that also reflects that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.840
 video provocation again and that's why 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 the video has so many clicks and me 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.119
 Now you know what I mean to you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.650
 wants to say at all 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.000
 I wrote down more fun 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 what if I just have videos 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 upload if I have more desire and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.159
 Although the videos are the first 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.990
 high quality you get 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.420
 more clicks or a better rating 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.829
 and usually more comments 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.150
 more fun watching longer videos 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.350
 through the extended working time 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.030
 few mistakes in the video and the only one 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 disadvantage is rare videos are 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.259
 uploaded and before now couple 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.369
 think people and now you come in 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.380
 month only one video 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.090
 the people that of course nonsense me 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.670
 I try every week at least 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 maybe even one or two 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 to upload two videos 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.369
 but as I said there is always mine 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.820
 lust for a mood and depending on 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.990
 then come the videos so come 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.880
 I'm going to the next topic I really 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.590
 has brought to thinking and that is 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.150
 that that I want some people that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.950
 They work best with research 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.560
 and just upload gameplay as well 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.940
 the good scores include why 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040
 that is not and never will be so 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.280
 Will I be kidding and good 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.139
 Uploading gameplays is easy 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.669
 because it is always in the youtube 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.410
 scene exactly the same one gets 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.960
 some lluc that was at least in the beginning 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.060
 so and the people cheer 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.950
 and who gets another two nukes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.510
 and it's a great highlight though 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.430
 sometime after two weeks it is 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.470
 need to get back to these two boys 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.660
 it must be xinyu sometime if it 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.540
 two luxury it is really bad and 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.890
 if it is a jux one day then 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.330
 it must be a lot of jux and it works 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.950
 on and on it has to be 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.740
 we already have the pentalog 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 our experience makes love people 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.380
 but I do not want to say more about that either 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.150
 that 's just always in constant 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.960
 competition everyone wants better than 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.760
 the other one 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.010
 and i want you to belong to me 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 crazy I think that makes me extreme 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.640
 have fun and of course play well 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.110
 and that's why I'm getting easy now 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.610
 divided if I make a comment 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.140
 I will deposit a good gameplay 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.550
 and if I 'm going to make a fool of myself 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.850
 I do not deposit music or the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.800
 even comment on post if necessary 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.210
 good that I'm an exception now 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.830
 I here or I do not put it now 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.420
 but that's just one gameplay 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.700
 except otherwise I am always subject to you 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.930
 and that 's just kind of like lok 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.780
 I would say because the bourgeois 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.580
 block and as I said it is only one 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.020
 except but I think so you can 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.520
 explain a few people better 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.560
 I also mentioned that is one 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.090
 exception is so I come to the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.980
 Next thing that really makes me feel 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.680
 has brought thought and that is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.510
 theme hate people say that the topic 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.980
 holding a really bad thing is 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.870
 but I can not quite agree 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.730
 because you have to see it through the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.710
 hague arise through the discussion 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.630
 discussion finally climbs through the 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.370
 city ​​people are bringing their friends and 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.950
 Ask for your opinion on the video 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.540
 so that anyone agrees with them 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.100
 Of course you get more clicks on 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.110
 video was always more people on it 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.000
 logically, this will show you then 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.020
 more ratings or more comments 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.120
 and thereby you get more 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.030
 verein best example of this is julians 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.980
 blog because some people hate everything 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.810
 and some people love him the people 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.100
 Hassenstein insults him as well 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.420
 example of the changer and so on and 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.070
 so on we all know each other 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.960
 and the other people over him 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.610
 love the defend arises 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.460
 of course, for example, a discussion 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.620
 shit because well reasons are more likely 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.030
 rarely in the people who insult 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.790
 but now and then it happens that 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.670
 any reason there is then 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.230
 the people come to the in vienna and the 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.880
 seems more then is not so 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.919
 do not even look at it you are yourself 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.820
 not successful and she does that 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.249
 always so on 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.739
 and then people always come 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.539
 more about that and that's how you get mine 

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:50.149
 best example of this is the video of the 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.919
 coupons because in this video I have 

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:53.539
 Of course, everything is not ours anyway 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.189
 Of course , I do not think so 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.419
 that I would be the quiz corboz and me 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.249
 never be white either 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.659
 of course we do not want him from today 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.949
 understand and that's why I have the am 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.479
 at the beginning of the video do not write something 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.219
 Of course, that's a shame but how 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.689
 That said, that's how I create and have it 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.399
 not necessarily something bad because 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.619
 people but once in my life 

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:12.499
 live at least something serious sound around 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:13.219
 At least once only seriously 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.439
 can take 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.019
 I say goodbye now 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:20.269
 will soon be kidding comics and again 

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:22.819
 it will always go on and you 

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:24.949
 know how it works and therefore 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.389
 I just say it in sneakers and 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.759
 if you're wondering why not 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.439
 I'm sorry in the shops sold out 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.439
 I have started a two purchase 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:49.120
 oh my god steve starred water that 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.699
 not one to one of every one 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.340
 to be bad but over knee one manages 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.430
 must be easy to get it as you bend 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.240
 really xx means you will find there 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.409
 a recently noted program 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.259
 a kreativkopf your mother looks at 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.889
 few sick awesome but why I can 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.240
 you understand 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.430
 such people have the detail 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.860
 to look for who is like you 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.340
 is there enough but I mean he can do it 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.340
 do not understand
