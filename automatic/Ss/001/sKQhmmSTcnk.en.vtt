00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.910
 good very mailmen we are we have 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.450
 minecraft to bring you a new way 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 called smart orchis and really what 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.490
 only one that adds is this torch that the 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.170
 true that pretty cool though good 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.600
 the only thing that changes with respect to so many 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.820
 abnormal as you can see is the color 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.920
 that is a little good those blue flowers 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.470
 while the other one is brown of color 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.330
 wood but not really this 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000
 torch is pretty good enough 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.440
 intelligent we could call her although the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.970
 People do not have any but the truth 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.340
 that is very very very very good because 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.100
 we can really use it for the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.719
 mining and it's going to be great because 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.360
 we can do little things like this one 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.210
 when we have for example the torch 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.920
 is the good smart torch coupled to 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.020
 any block for example to this one 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.539
 stone and we remove it for example what 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.550
 we look because it has an iron mine 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.920
 a coal mine a gold mine 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.770
 Diamond whatever it good 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.170
 we break and the torch will stick 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.330
 automatically to a random site by 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.220
 example is now for example that is 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080
 has stuck to the ground and has stuck to 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.280
 side is the bottom 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.380
 for example we can do for example 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.640
 so that it sticks to the other side if 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.580
 we do so it goes back to sticking to the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.860
 next while I have a site 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.180
 where to put is always going to get here 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.130
 at the moment when you no longer have 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.500
 no adjoining block as it will fall 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.080
 but it really is pretty smart 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.080
 As you can see, we can give you enough 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.060
 utilities and it's pretty cool I've 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.250
 delighted this way I really do it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.140
 of finding the main craft forums and 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.160
 well I said that although it is quite 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 simple 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.440
 I think you should have it because 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.030
 well, it's very, very cool and it's going to 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.860
 quite remove that problem that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.390
 respect good mining that I'm going to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.670
 teach also good in this example is 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.050
 another one of the good ones really with this 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.930
 example that I have already really taught 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.090
 we can see them all and well here it would be 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.729
 Well practically the same thing is not 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.920
 would hit any block that 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.410
 we had around here and we had around here 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.570
 a mine is the mine to see 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.600
 give me a bit to see if I see it is 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.700
 there 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.280
 I'm going to show you a little how 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.690
 so it would really work in the mine 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 it would work in the same way 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.850
 until we have good half 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.250
 let's have any adjoining block be 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.570
 go hitting and here for example we would have 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.090
 the utility is worth we will put that us 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.650
 we found the gold mine although to this 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 height will not find us is put 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.760
 I 'm going to go biting the gold mine and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.990
 at the time when we chop it is 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.980
 hit here and we do not stay in the dark 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.960
 so this is the real utility of this 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
 really good way I like pretty 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.940
 because good I'm old I'm going to 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.940
 start using safely in my 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.250
 adventures in singles player not in my 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.170
 videos surely because I see it a 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.930
 little bit dried but the truth is that I 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.110
 will remove enough problems regarding 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.390
 a good over normal not like 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.340
 the character by the way it is 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.900
 just like that we put a torch in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.450
 the table and fret in our inventory 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.360
 and is the way directly the smart 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.120
 force is not too difficult to 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.650
 good tune has no return 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.370
 back although I really do not think that 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.159
 we need 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.599
 it was a normal torch that we go to 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.849
 remove the move then what 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.040
 it would disappear in all the torches and 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.480
 well up here the way the truth that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.920
 is very very well I hope there is 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.540
 liked the video I loved it 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.489
 of course and nothing if you liked 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.079
 press well favorites do not forget to 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.790
 follow me on twitter and see you at the 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.790
