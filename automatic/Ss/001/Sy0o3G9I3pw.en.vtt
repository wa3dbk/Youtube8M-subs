00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
going to put in my head it was something

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.860 
going to put in my head it was something
I've<00:04:26.789> struggled<00:04:27.120> with<00:04:27.270> for<00:04:27.509> quite<00:04:27.630> some<00:04:27.840> time

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
I've struggled with for quite some time

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020 
I've struggled with for quite some time
it's<00:04:28.620> quite<00:04:28.770> embarrassing<00:04:28.889> for<00:04:29.400> me<00:04:29.520> if<00:04:29.880> you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
it's quite embarrassing for me if you

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.210 
it's quite embarrassing for me if you
watch<00:04:30.270> my<00:04:30.300> Watson<00:04:30.810> at<00:04:30.900> each<00:04:31.050> bag<00:04:31.260> video<00:04:32.010> you

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
watch my Watson at each bag video you

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.070 
watch my Watson at each bag video you
notice<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.699> my<00:04:32.789> hair<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:32.970> pulled<00:04:33.330> backwards

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.290 
notice that my hair is pulled backwards
like<00:04:34.139> this<00:04:34.199> that's<00:04:35.160> because<00:04:35.610> whenever<00:04:36.060> I

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
like this that's because whenever I

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.060 
like this that's because whenever I
would<00:04:36.539> wear<00:04:36.690> my<00:04:36.810> hair<00:04:36.990> down<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.620> was<00:04:37.650> curly
