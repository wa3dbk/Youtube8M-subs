00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.860 

power<00:00:14.960> cut<00:00:15.560> isn't<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:17.630> room<00:00:18.340> 7990<00:00:19.870> they

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
power cut isn't it to the room 7990 they

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.820 
power cut isn't it to the room 7990 they
decided<00:00:21.350> to<00:00:21.470> say<00:00:21.710> stew<00:00:22.100> AMD<00:00:22.940> and<00:00:23.830> literally

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
decided to say stew AMD and literally

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.680 
decided to say stew AMD and literally
got<00:00:25.130> in<00:00:25.460> you<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:26.480> let<00:00:26.750> go

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:46.530 

gap<00:00:32.200> on<00:00:32.470> that<00:00:32.740> day

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.000 

sorry<00:00:47.540> guys<00:00:47.780> I'll<00:00:48.350> just<00:00:48.590> screwing<00:00:48.920> around

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
sorry guys I'll just screwing around

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.620 
sorry guys I'll just screwing around
right<00:00:49.370> there<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.700> boy<00:00:49.850> did<00:00:49.910> I<00:00:50.090> destroy<00:00:50.270> my

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
right there and boy did I destroy my

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.420 
right there and boy did I destroy my
throat<00:00:50.900> actually<00:00:51.170> between<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.040> seem<00:00:52.280> that

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
throat actually between this seem that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.400 
throat actually between this seem that
last<00:00:52.640> one<00:00:52.850> actually<00:00:53.330> went<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:53.870> puked<00:00:54.230> my<00:00:54.380> guts

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
last one actually went and puked my guts

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.130 
last one actually went and puked my guts
out<00:00:54.800> man<00:00:55.040> because<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.460> kept<00:00:55.730> doing<00:00:55.880> that<00:00:56.140> voice

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
out man because I kept doing that voice

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.650 
out man because I kept doing that voice
sounds<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:57.640> but<00:00:58.640> anyways<00:00:58.880> you<00:00:59.270> guys<00:00:59.450> are

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
sounds like but anyways you guys are

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.960 
sounds like but anyways you guys are
here<00:00:59.840> because<00:01:00.110> power<00:01:00.740> cars<00:01:01.070> obviously<00:01:01.640> decide

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
here because power cars obviously decide

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.540 
here because power cars obviously decide
to<00:01:02.090> say<00:01:02.240> hey<00:01:02.420> screw<00:01:03.290> ND<00:01:03.739> we're<00:01:04.190> not<00:01:04.309> waiting

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
to say hey screw ND we're not waiting

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.430 
to say hey screw ND we're not waiting
any<00:01:04.790> longer<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.420> they<00:01:05.810> said<00:01:06.020> we're<00:01:06.200> releasing

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
any longer and they said we're releasing

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.940 
any longer and they said we're releasing
our<00:01:06.860> new<00:01:07.210> 7990<00:01:08.210> damn<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.870> torpedoes<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:09.770> this

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
our new 7990 damn the torpedoes so this

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.800 
our new 7990 damn the torpedoes so this
is<00:01:09.980> it<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.820> card<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.090> coming<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.420> market<00:01:11.600> with

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
is it this card is coming to market with

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.719 
is it this card is coming to market with
two<00:01:11.960> different<00:01:12.080> clock<00:01:12.350> speeds<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.770> have<00:01:12.890> 925

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
two different clock speeds you have 925

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.609 
two different clock speeds you have 925
as<00:01:13.940> your<00:01:14.060> main<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:14.930> have<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.110> boost<00:01:15.320> core

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
as your main and you have a boost core

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.990 
as your main and you have a boost core
which<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.920> thousand<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:16.550> it's<00:01:16.670> pretty<00:01:16.850> close

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
which is a thousand so it's pretty close

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400 
which is a thousand so it's pretty close
you<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.300> overclock<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> damn<00:01:17.990> thing<00:01:18.229> it's

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
you can overclock the damn thing it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.440 
you can overclock the damn thing it's
going<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.560> 6<00:01:18.979> gigabytes<00:01:19.160> of<00:01:19.550> RAM<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.030> it's

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
going to 6 gigabytes of RAM and it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.130 
going to 6 gigabytes of RAM and it's
basically<00:01:20.690> two<00:01:21.369> 7970<00:01:22.369> GPUs<00:01:23.000> slapped<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:24.110> the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
basically two 7970 GPUs slapped on the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.800 
basically two 7970 GPUs slapped on the
single<00:01:24.650> PCB<00:01:25.550> so<00:01:25.970> typically<00:01:26.390> when<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.690> guys

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
single PCB so typically when you guys

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.600 
single PCB so typically when you guys
see<00:01:27.080> they<00:01:27.290> make<00:01:27.470> these<00:01:27.619> cars<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.070> lot<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.400> times

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
see they make these cars a lot of times

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.609 
see they make these cars a lot of times
they'll<00:01:28.880> get<00:01:29.030> clocked<00:01:29.390> down<00:01:29.930> like<00:01:30.259> you'll<00:01:30.470> see

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
they'll get clocked down like you'll see

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
they'll get clocked down like you'll see
some<00:01:30.830> cards<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.190> will<00:01:31.250> come<00:01:31.460> out<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:31.880> it

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
some cards that will come out and it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.450 
some cards that will come out and it
won't<00:01:32.300> actually<00:01:32.450> be<00:01:32.690> two<00:01:33.110> gtx<00:01:33.530> 680<00:01:34.070> will<00:01:34.340> be

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
won't actually be two gtx 680 will be

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.790 
won't actually be two gtx 680 will be
actually<00:01:34.640> 279<00:01:35.360> 70s<00:01:35.900> but<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:36.590> time

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
actually 279 70s but this time

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.710 
actually 279 70s but this time
powercolor<00:01:37.729> because<00:01:38.150> they<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:38.330> got<00:01:38.420> tied

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
powercolor because they just got tied

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.330 
powercolor because they just got tied
awaiting<00:01:38.990> for<00:01:39.140> AMD<00:01:39.440> these<00:01:39.860> cards<00:01:40.220> are

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
awaiting for AMD these cards are

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.570 
awaiting for AMD these cards are
actually<00:01:40.790> two<00:01:41.030> complete<00:01:41.509> 79<00:01:42.229> 70s<00:01:42.800> on<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.979> single

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
actually two complete 79 70s on a single

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.780 
actually two complete 79 70s on a single
PCB<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.750> there<00:01:45.710> are<00:01:45.830> no<00:01:46.010> cut<00:01:46.250> down<00:01:46.430> clock

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
PCB and there are no cut down clock

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.170 
PCB and there are no cut down clock
speeds<00:01:47.150> no<00:01:47.870> cut<00:01:48.140> down<00:01:48.320> memory<00:01:48.620> no<00:01:49.340> nothing<00:01:49.940> cut

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
speeds no cut down memory no nothing cut

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.430 
speeds no cut down memory no nothing cut
down<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:50.750> basically<00:01:50.960> going<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.290> be<00:01:51.350> a

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
down so it's basically going to be a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.560 
down so it's basically going to be a
pretty<00:01:51.740> ballsy<00:01:52.190> ambitious<00:01:52.940> move<00:01:53.150> for<00:01:53.420> these

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
pretty ballsy ambitious move for these

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.480 
pretty ballsy ambitious move for these
people<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:54.620> check<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:54.860> out<00:01:55.040> you<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.280> see

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
people so check it out you can see

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.399 
people so check it out you can see
there's<00:01:55.670> three<00:01:55.909> fans<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:56.960> black<00:01:57.229> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
there's three fans on it it's black and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.260 
there's three fans on it it's black and
red<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.770> still<00:01:58.040> maintain<00:01:58.370> that<00:01:58.400> AMD<00:01:59.030> color

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
red so it still maintain that AMD color

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.270 
red so it still maintain that AMD color
scheme<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.170> those<00:02:00.290> fans<00:02:00.620> that<00:02:00.830> still<00:02:01.070> don't

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
scheme so those fans that still don't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880 
scheme so those fans that still don't
like<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.460> as<00:02:01.760> far<00:02:02.510> as<00:02:02.540> pricing<00:02:02.930> goes<00:02:03.260> we<00:02:03.710> don't

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
like it as far as pricing goes we don't

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.930 
like it as far as pricing goes we don't
really<00:02:04.010> know<00:02:04.159> what<00:02:04.310> that's<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.610> be<00:02:04.790> it

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
really know what that's going to be it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.640 
really know what that's going to be it
because<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:05.180> car<00:02:05.420> was<00:02:05.600> just<00:02:05.659> announced<00:02:06.170> but
