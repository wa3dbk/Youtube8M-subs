size on some of these components we

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.140

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
what it does is we've got here the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.509 
what it does is we've got here the
optimization<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.079> images<00:03:32.440> has<00:03:32.590> has<00:03:33.010> been<00:03:33.250> done

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
optimization of images has has been done

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.270 
optimization of images has has been done
it's<00:03:34.420> done<00:03:34.720> pretty<00:03:34.989> well<00:03:35.109> but<00:03:35.859> what<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.100> does

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
it's done pretty well but what it does

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.910 
it's done pretty well but what it does
here<00:03:36.639> is<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.970> says<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.389> we<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.690> reduce<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
here is it says that we can reduce the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.949 
here is it says that we can reduce the
edges<00:03:39.310> by<00:03:39.790> about<00:03:40.060> throwing<00:03:40.359> off<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> scent

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
edges by about throwing off the scent

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.160 
edges by about throwing off the scent
and<00:03:41.440> if<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.620> scroll<00:03:41.859> over<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.430> gives<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
and if you scroll over it gives you the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.599 
and if you scroll over it gives you the
image<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.709> then<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.250> gives<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.519> the

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
image and then it gives you the

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.069 
image and then it gives you the
compressed<00:03:46.000> version<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.690> see<00:03:46.870> that

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
compressed version so you can see that

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.289 
compressed version so you can see that
there<00:03:47.260> isn't<00:03:47.530> much<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:48.069> but<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:49.209> know

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
there isn't much in it but you know

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.420 
there isn't much in it but you know
there<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.690> some<00:03:50.079> saving<00:03:50.530> most<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.310> these

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
there is some saving most of these

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.530 
there is some saving most of these
things<00:03:51.790> here<00:03:52.120> most<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.450> these

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
recommendations you might only save a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.940 
recommendations you might only save a
few<00:03:54.400> percent<00:03:54.819> but<00:03:55.510> at<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.170> end<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.799> end
