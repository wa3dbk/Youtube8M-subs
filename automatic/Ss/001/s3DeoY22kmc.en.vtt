 such a small video today is the launch 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:34.839
 Volga gas-24 in the cold came the garage 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:52.520
 Now head did not start for about 5 days 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:01:05.199
 It is worth expressing the film test Well now I took 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:05.199
 keys blur already on the bar I turn on the mass 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.910
 There is a multi battery that is mutlu 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.910
 silver pump up a little fuel 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.000
 as evaporates from the carburetor inhale stands 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.930
 we will try to start 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:56.200
 car cold squeeze the clutch two 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.200
 times. times and try 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.810
 as they say with a half turn 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.019
 the whole process can be chosen and even 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.019
 a little bit at the beginning went 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.550
 they are cold 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.560
 a little bit so it is necessary that the collector 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.690
 warmed up let 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.280
 engine size is very large 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.040
 whether the top questions on easy starts 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.960
 pour it with a cold carburetor 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.500
 rubber drops fall directly on 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.760
 collector 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.230
 and so a little warm-up collector 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.220
 and all bands start working normally 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.500
 here they are native 600 rpm 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.810
 it's damp outside 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.010
 the park will come 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.720

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.290
 just a couple of ordinary until spilled 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.290
 collector 2 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:37.870
 well it works 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:41.890
 even though such a clear 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.370
 Don't miss the bars clearly each so 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.459
