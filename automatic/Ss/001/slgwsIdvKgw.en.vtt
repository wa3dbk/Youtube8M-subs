outside so I'm going to do five and a
half<00:00:34.559> by<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> half<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> come<00:00:38.040> over<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
half by two and a half so come over and

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:49.970 
half by two and a half so come over and
mark<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.110> paper<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> mark<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
all the way down see how many pieces I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.040 
all the way down see how many pieces I
can<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> two<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> half<00:00:59.219> by

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
can get out of this so two and a half by

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.660 
can get out of this so two and a half by
five<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.290> five<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.920> half<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.400> should

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
five and five and half and that should

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.010 
five and five and half and that should
be<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.600> 11<00:01:11.150> luggage<00:01:13.520> okay

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
be it because that's a 11 luggage okay

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.060 
be it because that's a 11 luggage okay
and<00:01:19.220> see<00:01:20.960> now<00:01:21.960> where<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> measured<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and see now where I measured here in the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
and see now where I measured here in the
center<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> cut<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
center you're not going to cut this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660 
center you're not going to cut this
because<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.170> where<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.979> hole<00:01:26.220> punches

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
because this is where your hole punches

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
because this is where your hole punches
are<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.210> they'll<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.650> between

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
are going to go they'll go in between

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
are going to go they'll go in between
here<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.509> paper<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
here and this paper is just going to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.130 
here and this paper is just going to
fold<00:01:31.710> over<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.310> ahead<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.020> cut<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
fold over so go ahead and cut it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:49.349 
fold over so go ahead and cut it
lengthwise

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.249 

and<00:01:50.359> you<00:01:50.450> don't<00:01:50.630> want<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.929> too<00:01:51.229> much
