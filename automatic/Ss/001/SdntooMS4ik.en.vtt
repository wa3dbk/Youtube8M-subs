use<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> BPL<00:00:40.710> goalkeeper<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
use a BPL goalkeeper and it is going to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
use a BPL goalkeeper and it is going to
be<00:00:42.450> pet<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> check<00:00:43.370> probably<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> op's

positioning<00:00:56.309> I've<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> basic<00:00:57.239> chemistry

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
positioning I've got the basic chemistry

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.430 
positioning I've got the basic chemistry
struggle<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.230> really

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440

struggle because I don't know really
know<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.710> chemist<00:00:59.070> child<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> use<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.609> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
know what chemist child to use if you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.650 
know what chemist child to use if you
guys<00:00:59.850> know<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> comments<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.629> what

guys know in the comments on what

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
guys know in the comments on what
chemistry<00:01:01.079> I'll<00:01:01.170> use<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.590> check<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
chemistry I'll use on check that be

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.880 
chemistry I'll use on check that be
really<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.760> interesting<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.420> know<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
really really interesting to know and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.740 
really really interesting to know and
hopefully<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.450> just

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
hopefully you know that you know I just

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660 
hopefully you know that you know I just
want<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.010> ever<00:01:08.310> centre-back

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
want to know really the ever centre-back

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
want to know really the ever centre-back
is<00:01:08.790> from<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> BPL<00:01:09.360> again<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.659> Cano<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
him too much she's sober power in this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
him too much she's sober power in this
game<00:01:16.380> eleven<00:01:17.220> thousand<00:01:17.610> seventy<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.119> cool

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
game eleven thousand seventy really cool

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.399 
game eleven thousand seventy really cool
i'm<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.420> too<00:01:18.540> sure<00:01:18.600> how<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.170> find

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
i'm not too sure how much you can find

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
i'm not too sure how much you can find
for<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.400> he's<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> backbone

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
for now but he's got a backbone

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.960 
for now but he's got a backbone
chemistry<00:01:21.720> style<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> helps<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
chemistry style so that helps is

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
chemistry style so that helps is
defending<00:01:23.970> heading<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> passing<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
defending heading and passing this is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
defending heading and passing this is
running<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> place<00:01:26.340> anymore<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.689> i

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
running that place anymore but like i

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.469 
running that place anymore but like i
said<00:01:27.810> seven<00:01:28.320> pace<00:01:28.500> 71<00:01:29.369> an<00:01:29.520> 80<00:01:29.729> heading<00:01:30.000> 7i
