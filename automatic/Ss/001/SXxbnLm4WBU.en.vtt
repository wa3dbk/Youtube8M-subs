00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.170
 or documented we make you another click 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.539
 solier mod let's start with this mode 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.300
 you can create clay soldiers and make 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.910
 armies also without the some objects 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.310
 they can be stronger you can also 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.859
 have pets but I will teach you the most 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.750
 basic since understanding this mode is very 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.759
 easy as is the black soldier is 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.640
 equipped and we're going to equip the soldier 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.400
 white if you have a stick you will have as a 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.950
 weapon like a sword not if we give it a 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.940
 link 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 sharpen the weapon if this blade that the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.910
 we can see in the water 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.260
 libby pad will have some pants 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.850
 we sealed a bowl bowl will have a shield 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 if we see an iron block it will improve the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 shield 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 You see it has improved if we give it a diamond 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.479
 will have a layer that gives you a little more 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.460
 armor you see if we give him who will have 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 a breastplate 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 we are when you will have food for 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.310
 When I get a little life I can 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.850
 eat and if the mosquito this is all not 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.190
 I know it's an optical effect, not the glasses 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.050
 beige and you're 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.390
 commase has returned the materials 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.430
 that will not use and standards now let's 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.230
 see the fight well we will not see all 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.450
 the whole fight in which lasts a lot of 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.400
 that has a lot of armor but good 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.170
 let's see a little bit to see how 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.170
 it is an area the lever 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.790
 and so on until someone wins nothing more 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 here is all the mystic you can do 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.220
 500 against 500 thousand against thousand there are many 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.550
 colors to choose now then you 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.000
 things and well 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.989
 If you do not want to see the fight anymore, we do not have 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.209
 a button that is where it is here is 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.940

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.940
