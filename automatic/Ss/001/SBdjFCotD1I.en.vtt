00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.400
 another samsung galaxy no 4 will mount a rom 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.070
 who has samsung personalization 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.779
 galaxy s is more I already have it installed I 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.189
 to finish the video I will show you the 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.470
 how are we going to do to install 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.670
 this rom in our device we are going to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.109
 do a little review what comes 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.550
 being the rumba increases what are the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.900
 desktop settings let's enter what 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.249
 what are the funds 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.250
 here we have what the funds of the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.660
 samsung galaxy s 6 we can not see that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.430
 has completely customization 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.770
 we can also access what are the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.910
 widgets that have the applications 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.860
 that we will have installed now 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.899
 we can also enter what are the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.820
 screen settings as we can see 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.469
 what are the effects of transition and 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.600
 some other configurations 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.829
 additional we go back we can also 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.960
 select what are some themes already 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.519
 you know that in order to have access to more 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.620
 issues we can have to create a 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.420
 account directly in the store 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.010
 samsung to be able to access what they are 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.510
 the free themes to be able to people 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.129
 to our device 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.509
 now we are going to move to the 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.130
 application drawer as you can see the 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.479
 rom is completely liquid 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.850
 simply have the applications 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.560
 necessary for its proper functioning 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.970
 as are the applications of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.439
 google services how can you negotiate 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.119
 for you we have no more applications 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.830
 additional as I entered what are the 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.240
 adjustments and we're going to move up 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.710
 where it says about the device here 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.820
 we can see the name of the rom that 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.200
 there would be an expert in one of the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.240
 Best rom who can bring your samsung 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.940
 Galaxy 14 as you can observe 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.440
 is based on the android version 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.670
 5.0.1 lollipop for this device what 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.840
 what is the kernel information and the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.520
 other information that the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.740
 reunited this section we go back 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.300
 now let's enter what they are 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.399
 application manager we are going to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.990
 see how it manages what memory is 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.850
 run this device as you can 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.979
 observe here will show us what a 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.869
 box as you can see we have 1.6 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.280
 gigabytes of ram memory you have to have 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.509
 note that when we install a rom 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.520
 and has the personation layer of 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.220
 samsung can increase a bit what 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.630
 is the consumption of ram memory now 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.100
 let's go in what is the section the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.720
 camera the camera works without any 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.310
 problem as you can see here too 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.899
 we can select what the modes are 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.580
 in these ways we can download 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.560
 directly from the samsung store 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.819
 we can also enter what are the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.050
 configurations and you can get the 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.120
 better match to what it is 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.120
 or the device multimedia camera 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 let's go back now let's go into 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.819
 what is the status bar as they can 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.050
 see the status bar is similar to the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.610
 that we have done some radio 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.989
 previously here we move what 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.060
 are the quick adjustments as they can 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.680
 observe are completely editable 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.819
 now we can also enter what is 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.650
 the task manager as they can 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.630
 observe here we have it we can also 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.640
 clean directly or simply because 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.380
 visualize what we have the consumption of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.300
 ram memory at this time we can see 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 we can finish everything we are going to accept 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.330
 that finalizes clean what is memory 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.160
 ram of the applications that we have 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.440
 running in the background and just 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 we will have a little more freedom what 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 which is the memory range other device 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.170
 well now the process of the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 installation so keep an eye on what you 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.380
 I'm going to explain first we're going to 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.730
 download from the video description what 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.010
 what is the rom and the girl copy to our 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.810
 microsd memory we can restart in 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.459
 recovery mode directly from the rom 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.019
 or they can do it by turning off their 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.819
 device holding down 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.739
 poor top volume with simultaneously 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.569
 and will enter the advanced recovery that 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.400
 have currently installed in your 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.959
 device first we're going to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.489
 install the rom then let's do 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.660
 another procedure so that it does not 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.010
 It works correctly in our 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.629
 device 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.700
 well as you can see we are already in 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.170
 the recovery mode simply to do 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.000
 the installation in clean as you already know 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.230
 we go to water and we will go to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.150
 where davis says let's select 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.879
 system we are going to select data and by 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.530
 last let's select what if already a 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.030
 Once we select these 4 white 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.470
 we simply move, I'm not going to 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.329
 to do because I already have Ã­tala to the ruin the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.739
 I want to keep trying simply 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.720
 when it is finished what the process of 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.430
 formatting installation sorry we're going 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.280
 back now we are going to direct 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.390
 where we have our our rom that 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.950
 we have downloaded from the description 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.420
 of the video I have a folder that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.579
 call rom tests and as you can see here 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.040
 we have what the rom folder is 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.780
 ron kuby for the 14 the only thing we have 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.329
 what to do is select the file and 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.980
 we install once the installation is installed 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.109
 file or with what I'm going to apply 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.819
 now once the file is installed 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.379
 we're just going to restart from another 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.720
 device and you'll see that your device 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.389
 will start in blog mode so it is not going 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.250
 to go from the samsung logo then what 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.260
 what we are going to do is we are going to pay 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.750
 our device we will pay and 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.580
 let's go into download mode 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.230
 then we will also download 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.079
 from the description of the video what 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.390

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.840
 installation through holdings 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.880
 we are simply going to install what is 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.160
