00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.370
 tactic has something for me always of the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.220
 Rules of the game in the market the word tactics 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.990
 not so much because that sounds 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.150
 always so chemical on so i can handle it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.750
 with the term tactics nothing nothing 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.700
 to begin 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.320
 for me it is important that in games 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.949
 a certain order that it has 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.689
 There are positions that are occupied and the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 both in the forward movement as well 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 are occupied in the backward movement 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.340
 we we have in the film nothing in it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.960
 what about the backward movement 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.700
 but we want the game 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.270
 move forward that is the central 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 my point of view is if the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.340
 players reasonably well in theory 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 they are trained so they know how 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.690
 they have to stand on the defensive 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 then you will come across your good pass 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.300
 and positional play with the ball in the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.430
 offensive 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 and now begins in the opponent 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.800
 half the creativity of the players here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.629
 of course I have to be very technical 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.449
 be good and there is no need 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.690
 youth coach before watching if the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.369
 basis is laid then I can at this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.790
 work delicacies that is a long one 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.799
 path 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 I have a very long time for it myself 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 also used with my team which 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.320
 caretaker but you can see from year to year 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.970
 the success and that is the most important 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.900
 to keep evolving and that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.140
 potential of his players at the maximum 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.259
 auszureizen 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.909
 and there are many possibilities for 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.740
 But I always think you have to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.659
 A goal has to be put on this one 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.420
 It is not allowed to describe oneself away 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 get irritated and then you will 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 away also at the conclusion one is to 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.100
 also measured the way 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.740
 the players want to develop further 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 One can one has in the club or 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 in his team as a coach and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.060
 long shelf life if if I have 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 always incorporate new things 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.159
 let and not always just the same 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.100
 sequences but the game is always creative 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.930
 developed further and here is no 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 to be afraid of having both in youth 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.229
 area as well as in the mens area itself 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.270
 to be guided by ideas and in which 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.370
 film are just a lot of many ideas in it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.160
 and I always just want to say that it is 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.920
 no one on one 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.770
 but he has to do that creatively 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.750
 continue to break down to its level 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.090
 may or even at its level hair 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.800
 so if my games break up then you can break high 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.480
 the conditions provide that they are 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.700
 then I can give a look 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.640
 many are ideas and can not always 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.780
 but it is implemented one to one 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.250
 maybe you can also share it 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.930
 can be taken or it can be sequences 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.490
 fit me well with the game character 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.560
 the player I am in mine 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.690
 So I try that team 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.880
 maybe somehow teach that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.760
 and to give the team as an idea 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.470
 Without an idea, a team is lost 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.150
 and it does not matter if we're with 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.980
 Two points play with a point 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.170
 play on the two hanging 210 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.870
 Two six or something to play 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.030
 important is that the players the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.130
 have an idea what I want 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.740
 How would I like to get there? 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.960
 and that the coach just made him one 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.560
 given the idea we can do it 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.930
 to reach 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.580
 and if you trust that and then you have to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 of course you bring stable to buback 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.390
 then he will become the player too 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.440
 follow and then you will cross over 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.880
 You will become medium term or long term 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.870
 the successes also tell you about yourself 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.870
 gladly wishes as a trainer
