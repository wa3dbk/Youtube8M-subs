to it and you want to have a redstone
line<00:01:11.460> connected<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.360> block<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.750> here

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
line connected to this block right here

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.260 
line connected to this block right here
and<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:16.040> little<00:01:17.040> redstone<00:01:17.939> torch

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and then have a little redstone torch

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.070 
and then have a little redstone torch
inverter<00:01:18.750> thingy<00:01:19.560> majiggy<00:01:20.000> with<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.270> piston<00:01:21.810> on

it so this will get you to the next

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
it so this will get you to the next
piston<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.830> will<00:01:26.130> need<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.580> redstone

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
piston which will need a redstone

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.810 
piston which will need a redstone
repeater<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.040> piece<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.460> redstone

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
repeater and then a piece of redstone

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.370 
repeater and then a piece of redstone
here<00:01:30.420> another<00:01:31.140> block<00:01:31.500> block<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:33.720> redstone

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
here another block block of redstone

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.640 
here another block block of redstone
block<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.549> top

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
block on top

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
redstone torch and a redstone torch here

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.440 
redstone torch and a redstone torch here
um<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:42.560> will<00:01:42.920> power<00:01:43.250> your<00:01:43.450> second<00:01:44.450> um<00:01:44.990> piston

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
um this will power your second um piston

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.730 
um this will power your second um piston
and<00:01:47.530> oh<00:01:49.090> no<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:50.960> not<00:01:51.110> how<00:01:51.260> it's<00:01:51.440> supposed<00:01:51.500> to

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
be it's gonna be over here I was

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.090 
be it's gonna be over here I was
wondering<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:56.240> was<00:01:56.630> like<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.870> 3rd<00:01:57.320> calm<00:01:57.860> and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
wondering this was like the 3rd calm and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.650 
wondering this was like the 3rd calm and
failed<00:01:58.340> building<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:59.140> okay<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:02.090> how

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
failed building that okay so this is how

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.300 
failed building that okay so this is how
it's<00:02:02.840> gonna<00:02:03.020> work<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.770> gonna<00:02:03.950> be<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
it's gonna work this is gonna be the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.190 
it's gonna work this is gonna be the
matter<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.510> you're<00:02:05.720> going<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.930> have<00:02:06.050> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
matter and you're going to have to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.490 
matter and you're going to have to
follow<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:07.820> just<00:02:08.030> build<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.540> true<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.170> 3d

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
follow you just build a true like 3d

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.150 
follow you just build a true like 3d
platform<00:02:10.429> like<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:11.350> technically<00:02:12.350> it's<00:02:12.620> 2<00:02:12.980> x

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
platform like this technically it's 2 x

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.480 
platform like this technically it's 2 x
3<00:02:13.190> x<00:02:13.400> 1<00:02:13.760> whenever<00:02:14.720> don't<00:02:15.440> need<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.800> go<00:02:16.220> into<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
3 x 1 whenever don't need to go into the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.020 
3 x 1 whenever don't need to go into the
specifics<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:18.709> have<00:02:18.860> lock<00:02:19.190> their<00:02:19.550> can

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
specifics so you have lock their can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.930 
specifics so you have lock their can
break<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:20.690> um<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.770> then<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.070> have<00:02:22.280> none

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
break this one um and then you have none

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.680 
break this one um and then you have none
redstone<00:02:23.510> torch<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.550> block<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.480> and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
redstone torch with a block on it and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.860 
redstone torch with a block on it and
then<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.170> repeat<00:02:27.590> pattern<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
then you repeat pattern like that and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.650 
then you repeat pattern like that and
this<00:02:30.230> redstone<00:02:31.190> torch<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.940> gonna<00:02:32.150> power<00:02:32.420> this

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
this redstone torch is gonna power this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.900 
this redstone torch is gonna power this
one<00:02:32.870> let<00:02:33.410> me<00:02:33.500> show<00:02:33.770> you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.670 

oh<00:02:36.170> forgot<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.350> put<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.560> deal<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:38.010> forgot<00:02:38.520> 12

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
oh forgot to put the deal a forgot 12

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.110 
oh forgot to put the deal a forgot 12
like<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:43.010> that's<00:02:44.010> gonna<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.430> very<00:02:44.460> fast

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
like that and that's gonna be very fast

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.070 
like that and that's gonna be very fast
and<00:02:46.760> next<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.240> continue<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and next you want to continue the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.080 
and next you want to continue the
pattern<00:02:49.410> because<00:02:50.190> make<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.850> or<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
pattern because make it to like or you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.610 
pattern because make it to like or you
platform<00:02:51.750> phone<00:02:52.560> with<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> block<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:54.620> I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
platform phone with a block like this I

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.650 
platform phone with a block like this I
always<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.670> bring<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.150> block<00:02:57.390> because

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
always like to bring the block because

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.490 
always like to bring the block because
it<00:02:58.260> makes<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.770> look<00:02:59.010> much<00:02:59.730> cleaner<00:03:00.500> in

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
it makes it look much cleaner in

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.580 
it makes it look much cleaner in
designing<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.420> always<00:03:03.840> love<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.440> keep

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
designing I I do always love to keep

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.670 
designing I I do always love to keep
things<00:03:04.860> bit<00:03:05.340> clean<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:07.140> need<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.650> a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
things bit clean and you need to have a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.110 
things bit clean and you need to have a
piston<00:03:08.400> there<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:10.490> one<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.760> piston

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
piston there because one of the piston

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.300 
piston there because one of the piston
later<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.540> gonna<00:03:12.720> make<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.470> our<00:03:13.710> first<00:03:14.070> little

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
later is gonna make the our first little

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.030 
later is gonna make the our first little
piston<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.030> act<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.810> butt<00:03:16.080> switch<00:03:16.380> so

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
piston here act like a butt switch so

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.510 
piston here act like a butt switch so
this<00:03:17.310> piston<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.090> reset<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> whole<00:03:18.780> system

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
this piston is to reset the whole system

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.340 
this piston is to reset the whole system
just<00:03:20.520> warning<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.030> guys<00:03:21.210> first<00:03:21.600> before<00:03:22.200> you

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
just warning you guys first before you

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.170 
just warning you guys first before you
build<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:24.260> block<00:03:25.490> let's<00:03:26.490> note<00:03:26.700> or<00:03:26.940> red

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
build it and block let's note or red

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.890 
build it and block let's note or red
stuff<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.350> where<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:31.370> little<00:03:32.900> butts

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
stuff this is where the little butts

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.400 
stuff this is where the little butts
which<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.320> going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.590> form<00:03:34.910> when<00:03:35.910> there's<00:03:36.150> a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
which is going to form when there's a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.930 
which is going to form when there's a
power<00:03:37.410> block<00:03:37.980> right<00:03:38.220> here<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.670> going<00:03:38.850> to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
power block right here it's going to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.020 
power block right here it's going to
make<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:40.050> go<00:03:40.440> off<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.610> not<00:03:41.820> going<00:03:41.940> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
make this go off and it's not going to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.560 
make this go off and it's not going to
retract<00:03:42.510> that's<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.709> problem<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.580> how<00:03:45.540> I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
retract that's the problem so how I

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.750 
retract that's the problem so how I
solved<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.350> i<00:03:46.560> put<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.800> piston<00:03:47.250> right<00:03:47.430> here

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
solved it is i put a piston right here

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.050 
solved it is i put a piston right here
to<00:03:48.060> make<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.360> retract<00:03:48.959> retract<00:03:49.920> after<00:03:50.850> it's

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
to make it retract retract after it's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.390 
to make it retract retract after it's
over<00:03:51.270> or<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.320> put<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.620> right<00:03:52.740> here<00:03:52.800> to

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
over or you can put it right here to

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400 
over or you can put it right here to
make<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.580> look<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.970> bit<00:03:54.000> oh<00:03:54.300> don't<00:03:55.140> make<00:03:55.260> it

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
make it look a bit oh don't make it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.240 
make it look a bit oh don't make it
facing<00:03:55.770> up<00:03:55.920> make<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.280> facing<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.150> like<00:03:57.959> that

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
facing up make it facing you like that

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.330 
facing up make it facing you like that
so<00:03:59.250> we<00:03:59.520> can<00:04:00.170> do<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:02.630> redstone<00:04:03.830> redstone<00:04:04.830> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
so we can do this redstone redstone and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.520 
so we can do this redstone redstone and
torch<00:04:07.850> torch<00:04:08.850> forgot<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.750> torch<00:04:10.280> torch<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.520> up

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
let me see like that see if that still

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.540 
let me see like that see if that still
works<00:04:49.310> no<00:04:50.310> that<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.030> because<00:04:52.280> delay<00:04:55.430> there<00:04:56.430> you

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
works no that is because delay there you

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.690 
works no that is because delay there you
go<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.870> remember<00:04:58.140> to<00:04:58.320> have<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.770> delay<00:04:59.220> on<00:04:59.490> the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
go so remember to have to delay on the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.200 
go so remember to have to delay on the
second<00:05:00.240> layer<00:05:01.039> 11<00:05:02.039> redstone<00:05:02.520> repeater<00:05:02.970> no

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
second layer 11 redstone repeater no

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.870 
second layer 11 redstone repeater no
delay<00:05:03.510> one<00:05:04.410> redstone<00:05:04.680> repeater<00:05:05.160> here<00:05:05.250> too<00:05:05.669> and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
delay one redstone repeater here too and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.150 
delay one redstone repeater here too and
then<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.690> rest<00:05:06.900> won't<00:05:07.140> need<00:05:07.380> any<00:05:07.650> redstone

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
then the rest won't need any redstone

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.159 
then the rest won't need any redstone
repeater<00:05:08.610> but<00:05:09.120> that's<00:05:09.360> pretty<00:05:09.630> much<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:10.050> for

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
repeater but that's pretty much it for

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.500 
repeater but that's pretty much it for
