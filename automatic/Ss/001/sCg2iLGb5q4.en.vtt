once I'm all done I start by applying

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.600 
once I'm all done I start by applying
one<00:04:28.440> clip<00:04:28.830> under<00:04:29.520> one<00:04:30.150> set<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.960> twists<00:04:31.610> the

one clip under one set of twists the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.760 
one clip under one set of twists the
hair<00:04:32.850> looks<00:04:33.120> very<00:04:33.300> similar<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.139> my<00:04:34.530> hair

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
can make magic

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.040 
can make magic
OhLaLa<00:04:46.639> think<00:04:47.639> about<00:04:47.880> wearing<00:04:48.090> hair<00:04:48.419> clips<00:04:48.780> is

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
OhLaLa think about wearing hair clips is

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.340 
OhLaLa think about wearing hair clips is
that<00:04:49.350> it's<00:04:49.560> secure<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:51.290> fly<00:04:52.290> super<00:04:52.980> fly<00:04:53.330> and

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
that it's secure it's fly super fly and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.460 
that it's secure it's fly super fly and
it's<00:04:55.350> detachable<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:56.790> you<00:04:57.240> don't<00:04:57.479> want<00:04:57.990> to

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
it's detachable so if you don't want to

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.580 
it's detachable so if you don't want to
wear<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.740> later<00:04:59.460> on<00:04:59.760> tonight<00:05:00.030> or<00:05:00.570> tomorrow<00:05:00.990> you

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
wear it later on tonight or tomorrow you

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.890 
wear it later on tonight or tomorrow you
can<00:05:01.770> simply<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:02.310> take<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.700> out<00:05:02.850> it's<00:05:03.540> not

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
can simply just take it out it's not

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:14.429 
can simply just take it out it's not
that<00:05:04.139> serious

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.040 

now<00:05:15.439> this<00:05:15.800> final<00:05:16.430> step<00:05:16.759> is<00:05:17.059> totally<00:05:17.869> optional

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
now this final step is totally optional

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.040 
now this final step is totally optional
I<00:05:18.710> went<00:05:19.400> ahead<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.879> started<00:05:20.089> to<00:05:20.360> unravel<00:05:20.539> my

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
I went ahead and started to unravel my

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.100 
I went ahead and started to unravel my
twist<00:05:21.409> a<00:05:21.740> little<00:05:22.369> bit<00:05:22.460> more<00:05:22.759> I<00:05:23.029> could<00:05:23.869> have

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
twist a little bit more I could have

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.559 
twist a little bit more I could have
done<00:05:24.349> without<00:05:24.619> this<00:05:24.979> step<00:05:25.339> it's<00:05:25.669> all<00:05:25.909> about

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
done without this step it's all about

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.989 
done without this step it's all about
trial<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.169> error<00:05:27.289> so<00:05:27.740> if<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:28.009> if<00:05:28.279> I<00:05:28.520> ever<00:05:28.699> do

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999 
trial and error so if I if I ever do

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.290 
trial and error so if I if I ever do
this<00:05:29.180> style<00:05:29.539> again<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.199> would<00:05:30.919> only<00:05:31.180> unravel<00:05:32.180> it

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300
