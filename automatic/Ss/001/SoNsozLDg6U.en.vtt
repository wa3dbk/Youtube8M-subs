this sport the PASM Package which is a
it's<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.500> big<00:03:51.710> deal<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:51.950> mean<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.280> suspension<00:03:52.790> is

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
it's a big deal I mean the suspension is

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.910 
it's a big deal I mean the suspension is
spectacular<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.840> actually<00:03:54.110> lowers<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.680> car

while<00:03:55.610> you're<00:03:55.760> driving<00:03:56.240> changes<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> mapping

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
while you're driving changes the mapping

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.130 
while you're driving changes the mapping
and<00:03:57.910> gives<00:03:58.910> you<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.090> different<00:03:59.630> throttle

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
and gives you a different throttle

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.290 
and gives you a different throttle
response<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.640> quite<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.030> spectacular

know the bosses are all service from

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.550 
know the bosses are all service from
underneath<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.780> they're<00:04:14.930> very<00:04:15.080> nice<00:04:15.230> because

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
underneath and they're very nice because

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.199 
underneath and they're very nice because
it's<00:04:15.739> completely<00:04:16.220> flat<00:04:16.519> underneath<00:04:17.030> if<00:04:17.120> you

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
it's completely flat underneath if you

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.720 
it's completely flat underneath if you
look<00:04:17.450> underneath<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:17.989> car<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:19.280> starts<00:04:19.640> at

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
look underneath this car it starts at

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.159 
look underneath this car it starts at
the<00:04:19.820> front<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.120> bumper<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.600> there's<00:04:20.959> a

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
the front of the bumper and there's a

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.620 
the front of the bumper and there's a
plates<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.700> plastic<00:04:23.150> shields<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.540> are

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
plates of plastic shields that are

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.790 
plates of plastic shields that are
screwed<00:04:23.870> in<00:04:24.020> all<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.290> way<00:04:24.380> through<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> back

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
screwed in all the way through the back

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.140 
screwed in all the way through the back
all<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.070> way<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.460> back<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.850> bumper

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
all the way to the back of the bumper

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.730 
all the way to the back of the bumper
here<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.840> make<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.169> nice<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.350> smooth

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
here to make it nice and smooth

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.830 
here to make it nice and smooth
underneath<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.280> there's<00:04:28.430> no<00:04:28.520> turbulence<00:04:28.840> at

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
underneath so there's no turbulence at

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.670 
underneath so there's no turbulence at
high<00:04:30.020> speeds

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
high speeds

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.100 
high speeds
nice<00:04:31.460> little<00:04:31.640> call<00:04:31.910> out<00:04:32.090> here<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:32.419> 3.6

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
nice little call out here it's 3.6

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.040 
nice little call out here it's 3.6
liters<00:04:33.470> 325<00:04:34.340> horsepower<00:04:34.780> it's<00:04:35.780> got<00:04:35.960> the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
liters 325 horsepower it's got the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.550 
liters 325 horsepower it's got the
updated<00:04:36.440> version<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.919> Vario<00:04:37.220> cam<00:04:37.520> and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
updated version of the Vario cam and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
updated version of the Vario cam and
connect<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.650> give<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.919> two<00:04:40.130> different<00:04:40.280> types

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
connect you give you two different types

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.909 
connect you give you two different types
of<00:04:40.729> camshafts<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:42.169> know<00:04:42.290> when<00:04:42.440> we<00:04:42.530> build<00:04:42.770> race

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
of camshafts you know when we build race

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.680 
of camshafts you know when we build race
cars<00:04:42.950> we<00:04:43.430> build<00:04:43.640> them<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.180> big<00:04:44.360> lumpy

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
cars we build them with the big lumpy

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.909 
cars we build them with the big lumpy
camshaft<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:45.350> they<00:04:45.440> make<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.590> lot<00:04:45.680> of

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
camshaft so they make a lot of

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.430 
camshaft so they make a lot of
horsepower<00:04:46.210> at<00:04:47.210> higher<00:04:47.390> rpms<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.200> they<00:04:48.320> have

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
horsepower at higher rpms but they have

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.830 
horsepower at higher rpms but they have
no<00:04:48.620> throttle<00:04:49.280> response<00:04:49.520> down<00:04:50.000> low<00:04:50.270> with<00:04:50.720> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
no throttle response down low with the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.360 
no throttle response down low with the
Vario<00:04:51.140> cam<00:04:51.410> which<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.710> get<00:04:51.830> is<00:04:51.979> you<00:04:52.070> get<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
Vario cam which you get is you get the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.469 
Vario cam which you get is you get the
best<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.729> both<00:04:52.880> worlds<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.300> get<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:54.050> lower

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
best of both worlds you get the lower

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.850 
best of both worlds you get the lower
throttle<00:04:56.479> response<00:04:56.570> at<00:04:56.930> lower<00:04:57.080> rpms<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.740> then

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
throttle response at lower rpms and then

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.350 
throttle response at lower rpms and then
you<00:04:57.950> get<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.190> high<00:04:58.340> horsepower<00:04:58.700> at<00:04:59.060> higher

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
you get the high horsepower at higher

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.270 
you get the high horsepower at higher
