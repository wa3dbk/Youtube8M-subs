 Come back. Let's play that song of love with a high code. 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:18.119
 This is only 4/4 of the time. 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:22.990
 And then turn to the end of the language that ended without flash . 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.200
 That is, a lover's allegation. 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:31.930
 The main three chords of Anju every day are a marina di mana 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.300
 The code that's been used is a minor code used by the team 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.090
 It was a lot. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.720
 And c code and quality code 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:48.010
 So I was five high school boys 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:51.270

 Else d minor code dvr code number b of a minor code of the press 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.900
 Turn off the look exactly 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:10.450
 4 This is a minor code d 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:18.300
 This is just the seventh sanitary code from ope kobee 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.300
 If none of this over the adjournment, and the code here three times simyeon lift your finger 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 This Seven code will 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:30.040
 However, because of this inconvenience, 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:34.500
 This is where your finger is pressed three times, 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.500
 This is not a subdivision. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.570

 That's what happens. 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.060
 In the blood of the fifth class code 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.290
 1 2 If you play a story 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.290
