let myself have one extra protein
history<00:01:14.990> mostly<00:01:15.649> because<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.540> just<00:01:17.540> during

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
history mostly because I just during

you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.500 
you
I<00:01:25.740> went<00:01:26.520> ahead<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> did<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:27.330> thought

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
I went ahead and did it and I thought

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.500 
I went ahead and did it and I thought
well<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> scale<00:01:28.230> goes<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.680> today<00:01:29.160> that's

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
well if the scale goes up today that's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.230 
well if the scale goes up today that's
what<00:01:30.510> will<00:01:30.600> happen<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:32.610> didn't<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.000> went

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
what will happen and it didn't it went

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.320 
what will happen and it didn't it went
down<00:01:33.710> actually<00:01:34.710> 2.2<00:01:35.580> so<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.150> pretty

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
down actually 2.2 so that was pretty

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.240 
down actually 2.2 so that was pretty
good<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.840> had<00:01:36.960> only<00:01:37.080> been<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.710> point<00:01:38.070> 8

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
good and I had only been down point 8

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
good and I had only been down point 8
the<00:01:38.430> day<00:01:38.580> before<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:40.380> had<00:01:40.680> been<00:01:41.270> really

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the day before and I had been really

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.740 
the day before and I had been really
good<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.840> day<00:01:43.020> before<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.570> main

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
good the day before so I think the main

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990 
good the day before so I think the main
things<00:01:46.050> that<00:01:46.260> are<00:01:46.530> helping<00:01:46.800> me<00:01:46.980> are<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.580> drink

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
things that are helping me are I drink

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.110 
things that are helping me are I drink
too<00:01:48.720> many<00:01:48.840> big<00:01:49.260> old<00:01:49.440> puppies<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> day<00:01:50.540> and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.750 

Goshta<00:01:57.120> I<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.810> keep<00:01:58.020> telling<00:01:58.050> myself<00:01:58.760> it's

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
Goshta I just keep telling myself it's

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.290 
Goshta I just keep telling myself it's
not<00:02:00.000> permanent<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.900> not<00:02:01.050> permanent<00:02:01.500> but

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
not permanent this is not permanent but

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.950 
not permanent this is not permanent but
the<00:02:03.300> problems<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.160> obesity<00:02:05.160> causes<00:02:05.490> are

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
the problems that obesity causes are

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.960 
the problems that obesity causes are
permanent<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.260> can<00:02:07.470> become<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:10.970> that's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
permanent and they can become so that's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
permanent and they can become so that's
a<00:02:12.240> way<00:02:12.360> better<00:02:12.390> way<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:16.070> any<00:02:17.070> other

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
a way better way to do it and any other
