I<00:03:57.520> think<00:03:58.520> universities<00:03:58.940> it's<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.540> great

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
I think universities it's a great

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.180 
I think universities it's a great
learning<00:04:00.020> experience<00:04:00.290> obviously<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:01.100> know

learning experience obviously you know

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.470 
learning experience obviously you know
there's<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> lot<00:04:01.430> more<00:04:01.640> than<00:04:01.910> just<00:04:01.940> your<00:04:02.150> degree

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
there's a lot more than just your degree

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.890 
there's a lot more than just your degree
there<00:04:02.750> it's<00:04:02.960> just<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.500> whole<00:04:03.710> experience<00:04:04.900> and

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
there it's just the whole experience and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.920 
there it's just the whole experience and
I<00:04:06.260> think<00:04:06.730> yeah<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.760> went<00:04:08.210> required<00:04:08.510> open<00:04:08.750> mind

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930

I think yeah I went required open mind
about<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.440> think<00:04:09.530> that's<00:04:09.710> quite

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
about it so I think that's quite

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.520 
about it so I think that's quite
important<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.610> just<00:04:11.330> being<00:04:11.510> prepared<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.930> get

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
important and just being prepared to get

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.020 
important and just being prepared to get
stuck<00:04:12.830> into<00:04:13.010> things<00:04:13.310> throw<00:04:13.520> yourself<00:04:13.850> into

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
stuck into things throw yourself into

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.280
