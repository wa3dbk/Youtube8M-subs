sort<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> tribal<00:00:28.830> aztec<00:00:29.070> print<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.710> they're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
sort of tribal aztec print and they're

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.459 
sort of tribal aztec print and they're
this<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.189> soft<00:00:32.790> wool<00:00:33.239> i'm<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:34.020> sure<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
this really soft wool i'm not sure the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.380 
this really soft wool i'm not sure the
exact<00:00:34.860> fabric<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:35.670> i<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.149> wool

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
exact fabric but i think it's wool

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.560 
exact fabric but i think it's wool
merino<00:00:37.110> maybe<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.640> they<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> little

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
merino maybe so they have this little

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920 
merino maybe so they have this little
inset<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.680> side<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.750> they're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
inset on the side and i think they're

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.430 
inset on the side and i think they're
slightly<00:00:43.230> longer<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> back<00:00:44.190> maybe<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.820> but

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
slightly longer and back maybe now but

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.840 
slightly longer and back maybe now but
anyway<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> they're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
anyway what i like about them is they're

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
anyway what i like about them is they're
high-waisted<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.500> easily<00:00:49.829> wear

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
high-waisted and you can easily wear

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.770 
high-waisted and you can easily wear
them<00:00:50.370> over<00:00:50.579> tights<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.629> also

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
them over tights and they also

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.979 
them over tights and they also
incorporate<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.969> sort<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.090> tribal<00:00:54.750> aztec

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
incorporate that sort of tribal aztec

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.610 
incorporate that sort of tribal aztec
print<00:00:55.949> trend<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.260> bit<00:00:58.379> muted

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
print trend but it's a little bit muted

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.400 
print trend but it's a little bit muted
because<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.850> black<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.359> gray<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
because it's just in black and gray so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
because it's just in black and gray so
that's<00:01:02.309> why<00:01:02.550> i<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.149> they're<00:01:03.420> really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that's why i got them they're really

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's why i got them they're really

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
thought a pop of cobalt blue would look

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
thought a pop of cobalt blue would look
really<00:01:09.659> cool<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> wore<00:01:11.040> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
really cool with them so I wore this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.609

blouse<00:01:14.880> over<00:01:15.869> top<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.299> a<00:01:18.299> lot<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> people<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
blouse over top and a lot of people are

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.490 
blouse over top and a lot of people are
doing<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.979> half<00:01:20.250> tuck<00:01:20.700> thing<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> tried<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
doing this half tuck thing so I tried it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.609 
doing this half tuck thing so I tried it
out<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.040> talked<00:01:23.369> half<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
out and I talked half in here and then I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.789 
out and I talked half in here and then I
left<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> other<00:01:26.280> half<00:01:26.640> laying<00:01:27.090> down

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
left the other half laying down

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.200 
left the other half laying down
otherwise<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.220> hang<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:29.970> way

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
otherwise it would just hang all the way

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
otherwise it would just hang all the way
down<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> didn't<00:01:31.049> want<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.200> tuck<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> all

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
down and I didn't want to tuck it all

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.319 
down and I didn't want to tuck it all
the<00:01:31.920> way<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:32.880> dorky

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the way in because that's really dorky

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.620 
the way in because that's really dorky
so<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> tried<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.759> there's<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.150> extra

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so I tried it there's a little extra

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
so I tried it there's a little extra
fabric<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> shorts<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
fabric in the shorts there so that's the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
fabric in the shorts there so that's the
only<00:01:39.119> thing<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.540> annoys<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
only thing that annoys me about it and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010 
only thing that annoys me about it and
it<00:01:41.130> doesn't<00:01:41.520> quite<00:01:41.670> lay<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it doesn't quite lay right but it's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.130 
it doesn't quite lay right but it's
almost<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:45.479> other<00:01:45.810> people

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
almost there so I think other people

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
almost there so I think other people
when<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.680> they're<00:01:47.130> probably<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
when they do it they're probably just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.149 
when they do it they're probably just
doing<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.090> their<00:01:48.240> blog<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
doing it for their blog so they just

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.710 
doing it for their blog so they just
take<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> pictures<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> right<00:01:51.210> angles

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
take the pictures in the right angles

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.010 
take the pictures in the right angles
and<00:01:52.020> they're<00:01:52.320> set<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.670> reality<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.509> don't

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and they're set but in reality I don't

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
and they're set but in reality I don't
think<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> looks<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.700> public

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
think it looks as good out in the public

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.109 
think it looks as good out in the public
as<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.229> does<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.920> fashion<00:01:59.490> blogger<00:01:59.729> photo

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
as as it does in a fashion blogger photo

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.109 
as as it does in a fashion blogger photo
so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.990> wouldn't<00:02:01.950> suggest<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> looks

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so I wouldn't suggest it but it looks

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690
