00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
specs and we all had different ideas we

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.069 
specs and we all had different ideas we
wanted<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> bring<00:00:39.149> something<00:00:39.449> unique<00:00:39.870> and

other about you know the specs of the
guitars<00:00:44.519> we<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.629> two<00:00:45.929> primary<00:00:46.559> tunings<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
guitars we have two primary tunings that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.389 
guitars we have two primary tunings that
we<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.239> dropped<00:00:48.690> G<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.289> drop<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
we use which are dropped G and drop a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.720 
we use which are dropped G and drop a
and<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.179> use<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.510> Dario<00:00:51.899> strings<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and we use do Dario strings and with the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.419 
and we use do Dario strings and with the
drop<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.120> tuning<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.750> 62<00:00:55.410> 210<00:00:55.739> gauge<00:00:56.010> and

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
drop a tuning we use 62 210 gauge and

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.900 
drop a tuning we use 62 210 gauge and
with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> drop<00:00:57.210> G<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.750> use<00:00:57.899> 68<00:00:58.469> 211<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
with the drop G we use 68 211 and I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
with the drop G we use 68 211 and I
definitely<00:01:00.089> find<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:01.199> signature

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
definitely find that the signature

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
definitely find that the signature
models<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.609> help<00:01:02.760> compliment<00:01:03.329> those

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
models really help compliment those

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
models really help compliment those
tunings<00:01:03.929> and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.470> fact<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.189> we

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
tunings and the fact that you know we

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
tunings and the fact that you know we
are<00:01:05.460> using<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> DiMarzio<00:01:06.390> pickups<00:01:06.450> which

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
are using the DiMarzio pickups which

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.780 
are using the DiMarzio pickups which
helped<00:01:07.380> bring<00:01:07.680> forth<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> clarity<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
helped bring forth a lot of clarity and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
helped bring forth a lot of clarity and
those<00:01:08.939> lower<00:01:09.180> tunings<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:10.200> active<00:01:10.650> pickups

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
those lower tunings with active pickups

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
those lower tunings with active pickups
it<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:11.970> compressed<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> mushy

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it can get really compressed and mushy

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
it can get really compressed and mushy
sometimes<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.829> tune<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:14.220> low<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
sometimes when you tune that low so with

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.600 
sometimes when you tune that low so with
the<00:01:15.390> passive<00:01:15.990> DiMaggio's<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.649> definitely<00:01:17.009> feel

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the passive DiMaggio's I definitely feel

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
the passive DiMaggio's I definitely feel
like<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.119> helps<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.020> lower<00:01:19.320> tunings

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
like that really helps the lower tunings

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
like that really helps the lower tunings
cut<00:01:19.979> through<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> mix<00:01:20.460> well<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> DiMarzio<00:01:21.689> is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
cut through the mix well the DiMarzio is

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.960 
cut through the mix well the DiMarzio is
as<00:01:22.110> far<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.829> know<00:01:22.920> lower<00:01:23.130> tuning<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.729> think

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
as far as you know lower tuning I think

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
as far as you know lower tuning I think
you<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> clarity<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.740> lower

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you get a lot of clarity out of lower

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
you get a lot of clarity out of lower
tunings<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.670> passive<00:01:27.390> pickup<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.079> just

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
tunings with passive pickup it just

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
tunings with passive pickup it just
compliment<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> tunings<00:01:29.369> we're<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> lot

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
compliment the tunings we're in a lot

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
compliment the tunings we're in a lot
better<00:01:30.299> than<00:01:30.600> most<00:01:31.020> pickups<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:32.009> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
better than most pickups and when we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
better than most pickups and when we
first<00:01:32.310> started<00:01:32.460> messing<00:01:32.909> around<00:01:33.000> some<00:01:33.270> these

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
first started messing around some these

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.980 
first started messing around some these
pickups

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pickups

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.539 
pickups
you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.350> we'd<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.710> played<00:01:34.950> actives<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you know we'd all played actives for a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
you know we'd all played actives for a
long<00:01:35.759> time<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.299> after<00:01:36.659> trying<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
long time and after trying it out it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
long time and after trying it out it
just<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> street<00:01:38.399> shined<00:01:38.729> more<00:01:39.030> they

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
just that the street shined more they

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.569 
just that the street shined more they
stood<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.409> more<00:01:40.530> organic<00:01:40.979> sounding<00:01:41.399> I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
chose a maple fretboard over an ebony
just<00:01:44.039> because<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.460> liked<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.149> sort<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just because I liked the sort of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539

snappiness<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.979> going

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
snappiness it had to it I'm going

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.730 
snappiness it had to it I'm going
through<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> middle<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.539> mix<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
through like the middle of the mix so I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.319 
through like the middle of the mix so I
feel<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.460> maple<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.969> of<00:01:51.060> shines

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
feel like the maple kind of shines

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
feel like the maple kind of shines
through<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.170> better<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.039> lead

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
through a little better for like lead

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.789 
through a little better for like lead
work<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.880> melodic<00:01:54.600> art<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.140> went<00:01:55.350> Matt<00:01:55.560> because

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
work and melodic art I went Matt because

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
work and melodic art I went Matt because
I<00:01:56.189> liked<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> clean<00:01:56.729> look<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.270> very

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
I liked the clean look out it's very

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.450 
I liked the clean look out it's very
metal<00:01:57.780> very<00:01:58.109> ominous<00:01:58.799> looking<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> sense

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
metal very ominous looking in a sense

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.649 
metal very ominous looking in a sense
but<00:01:59.579> I'd<00:01:59.670> want<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.850> go<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> top<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
but I'd want to go over the top with it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.609 
but I'd want to go over the top with it
I<00:02:00.719> wanted<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.990> some<00:02:01.109> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.229> different

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
I wanted to some a little different

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.840 
I wanted to some a little different
that's<00:02:01.710> why<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.859> did<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> see-through<00:02:02.430> satin

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's why I did the see-through satin

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270 
that's why I did the see-through satin
on<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> top<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.719> quilted<00:02:04.229> maple<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.829> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
on the top with the quilted maple and I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.490 
on the top with the quilted maple and I
think<00:02:05.609> he<00:02:05.670> came<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.600> cool<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.409> was

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
think he came out really cool and I was

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350 
think he came out really cool and I was
pleased<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:09.030> he<00:02:09.090> gave<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
pleased with it and I think he gave it a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150 
pleased with it and I think he gave it a
different<00:02:09.390> vibe<00:02:09.869> especially<00:02:10.440> having<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
different vibe especially having the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.130 
different vibe especially having the
and<00:02:11.370> cedar<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:11.730> opposed<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> Glaus<00:02:12.330> when<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.020> was

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and cedar as opposed to Glaus when I was

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.320 
and cedar as opposed to Glaus when I was
trying<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.380> decide<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.010> color<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:15.180> my

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
trying to decide the color for my

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
trying to decide the color for my
signature<00:02:15.870> model<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.470> had<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.860> idea<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
signature model I just had this idea to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.760 
signature model I just had this idea to
do<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> blood-red<00:02:18.570> burst<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.410> that's<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.740> I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
do a blood-red burst and that's what I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.320 
do a blood-red burst and that's what I
told<00:02:19.860> him<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.370> said<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.120> know<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.240> don't

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
told him I just said you know I don't

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.480 
told him I just said you know I don't
really<00:02:21.630> know<00:02:21.750> how<00:02:21.990> else<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.560> describe<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:23.250> then

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
really know how else to describe it then

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.820 
really know how else to describe it then
blood<00:02:23.820> red<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.960> bursting<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.590> black

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
blood red then have it bursting to black

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.470 
blood red then have it bursting to black
on<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> edges<00:02:26.520> they<00:02:26.790> definitely<00:02:27.120> did<00:02:27.450> a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
on the edges they definitely did a

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870 
on the edges they definitely did a
killer<00:02:27.720> job<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> flame<00:02:28.800> maple<00:02:29.010> talk<00:02:29.340> just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
killer job but the flame maple talk just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.580 
killer job but the flame maple talk just
really<00:02:30.180> accents<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.840> nice<00:02:31.080> board<00:02:31.410> red

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
really accents that nice board red

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.920 
really accents that nice board red
