00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.060
 planted accompanied the growth and with dark circles 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.300
 it is so on the day of 'judas' oak 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.930
 he was one of the ten families selected to attend a 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.040
 project that encourages the planting of vegetables 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.980
 in an integrated manner and supports the project's vision that 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.010
 vegetable production 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.300
 thus improving income 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.839
 and food 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.010
 all in the corn said we are positioned our green belt 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.460
 all production is being allocated to the rehabilitation program 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 criminal justice school 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.069
 the vegetable garden was strategically designed 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:45.190
 where in circular format 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 facilitates the movement of people and the planting of several other lists 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.190
 for the engineer 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.960
 flowers are planted to prevent pests 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.050
 multiply in the plantation 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049
 the result is positive 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.959
 carrots beets and lettuces 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:05.060
 are harvested daily 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.410
 every shift she is strategically placed her flowers 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.040
 is that we are seeing here they work they work as repellent 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 nor so the plague quique perhaps comes the plate that greenery she is attracted to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.100
 If she is not trapped in flowers then she stops causing damage to 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.549
 vegetables are grown with organic fertilizer 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.990
 apparently nothing of this terrain 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.360
 is placed in that henhouse where it mixes with pieces of birds 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.020
 and turn into organic manure after the straw stay for 60 days in the chicken coop 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 it is placed in the composting system where it is also 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.450
 period of two months 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.100
 and returns to the garden 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.860
 the Jewish peasants 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560
 said to be happy 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.619
 because the sale helps in the expenses of the house to implant is a therapy my son is 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.320
 precisely because it helps 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 she judges the mark so far and I went to work 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.720
 help to sell in the city he who came however well in progress and that 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 should be to have a pilot
