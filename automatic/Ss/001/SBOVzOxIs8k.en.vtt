you definitely have a great device that

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.590 
you definitely have a great device that
can<00:00:43.320> stand<00:00:43.679> alone<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.100> its<00:00:44.249> own<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.359> on<00:00:45.510> the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
if need be built in as well so you do
have<00:01:26.610> hspa+<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.680> 3g<00:01:29.549> /<00:01:29.789> 4g<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.930> 3.5<00:01:31.469> g

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
have hspa+ so you have 3g / 4g or 3.5 g

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.349 
have hspa+ so you have 3g / 4g or 3.5 g
whatever<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.399> call<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> do

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
frequency areas and of course this is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.370 
frequency areas and of course this is
ip67<00:01:40.590> certified<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:42.000> means<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.539> can<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:43.109> in

ip67 certified which means you can go in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.240 
ip67 certified which means you can go in
the<00:01:43.469> water<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:44.009> 30<00:01:44.399> minutes<00:01:45.229> add<00:01:46.229> three<00:01:47.009> feet

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the water for 30 minutes add three feet

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.389 
the water for 30 minutes add three feet
in<00:01:47.750> terms<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.929> sensors<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.859> couple

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
in terms of sensors you do have a couple

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.700 
in terms of sensors you do have a couple
of<00:01:50.820> different<00:01:51.179> ones<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.710> gyroscope

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
of different ones a gyroscope

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
of different ones a gyroscope
accelerometer<00:01:52.859> compass<00:01:53.539> ambient<00:01:54.539> light<00:01:54.719> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
accelerometer compass ambient light you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.429 
accelerometer compass ambient light you
of<00:01:55.469> course<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.859> have<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.460> barometer<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.539> UV

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
of course you have a barometer and UV

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
of course you have a barometer and UV
and<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:59.429> most<00:01:59.579> important<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.210> fitness

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and the most important one for fitness

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
and the most important one for fitness
of<00:02:00.810> course<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.259> heart<00:02:01.590> rate<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.460> says<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.880> Tyson

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
of course is heart rate it says up Tyson

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.020 
of course is heart rate it says up Tyson

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
which I'm a bit mixed about advantages

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.070 
which I'm a bit mixed about advantages
and<00:02:08.490> disadvantages<00:02:09.090> say<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> least<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and disadvantages say the least on that
