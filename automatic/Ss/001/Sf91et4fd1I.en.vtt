00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
look at one light wonders and how to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.499 
look at one light wonders and how to
make<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> most<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.609> using<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.000> single<00:00:06.210> light

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
make the most of using a single light

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:25.120 
make the most of using a single light
both<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.290> outside<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.859> studio

in what I really like about using a

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.689 
in what I really like about using a
single<00:00:30.169> light<00:00:30.320> is<00:00:30.500> complete<00:00:30.949> simplicity<00:00:31.640> and

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
single light is complete simplicity and

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.520 
single light is complete simplicity and
freedom<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.210> gives<00:00:32.329> you<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.989> really<00:00:33.320> allows

aspects<00:00:35.449> of<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:35.690> shoot<00:00:35.870> such<00:00:36.559> as<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.829> model

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
aspects of the shoot such as the model

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.889 
aspects of the shoot such as the model
and<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.430> posing<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.300> also<00:00:38.480> great<00:00:38.840> when

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
and the posing it's also great when

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.900 
and the posing it's also great when

you're out on location enabling you to
travel<00:00:41.329> light<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.720> work<00:00:41.870> quickly<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.980> kick

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
travel light and work quickly to kick

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.860 
travel light and work quickly to kick
off<00:00:43.309> with<00:00:43.430> one<00:00:43.610> light<00:00:43.790> wonders<00:00:44.180> using<00:00:44.780> a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
off with one light wonders using a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.810 
off with one light wonders using a
single<00:00:45.199> head<00:00:45.409> with<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.710> standard<00:00:46.129> softbox<00:00:46.579> a

single head with a standard softbox a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.360 
single head with a standard softbox a
place<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.600> softbox<00:00:48.079> about<00:00:48.379> two<00:00:48.620> feet<00:00:48.920> away<00:00:49.070> and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
place a softbox about two feet away and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.310 
place a softbox about two feet away and
slightly<00:00:49.699> higher<00:00:49.879> then<00:00:50.780> I'm<00:00:50.989> going<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.199> use<00:00:51.290> a

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
slightly higher then I'm going to use a

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.740 
slightly higher then I'm going to use a
wide-angle<00:00:51.620> lens<00:00:51.949> get<00:00:52.670> above<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.149> model<00:00:53.479> to

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
wide-angle lens get above the model to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.990 
wide-angle lens get above the model to
try<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.050> distort<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.500> perspective<00:00:54.979> so<00:00:55.640> by

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
try and distort the perspective so by

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.429 
try and distort the perspective so by
placing<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.479> softbox<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.050> side<00:00:57.229> of<00:00:57.379> the

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:57.439 
placing the softbox to the side of the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.350 
placing the softbox to the side of the
model<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:57.830> facing<00:00:58.280> down<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.760> helps<00:00:59.119> a<00:00:59.180> light

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
model and facing down it helps a light

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.880 
model and facing down it helps a light
fall<00:00:59.600> off<00:00:59.780> quickly<00:01:00.019> in<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> background

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
fall off quickly in the background

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.160 
fall off quickly in the background
once<00:01:01.699> you've<00:01:01.850> metered<00:01:02.150> up<00:01:02.299> get<00:01:02.689> the<00:01:02.809> model<00:01:03.080> to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
once you've metered up get the model to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.020 
once you've metered up get the model to
move<00:01:03.350> around<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.830> change<00:01:04.070> positions<00:01:04.580> in

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
move around and change positions in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.880 
move around and change positions in
order<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.360> get<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.600> best<00:01:05.750> out<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.049> shot<00:01:06.290> okay

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
order to get the best out the shot okay

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:26.530 
order to get the best out the shot okay
so<00:01:06.950> statue<00:01:24.759> in<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:25.970> shot<00:01:26.210> we're<00:01:26.360> going<00:01:26.390> to

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
so statue in this shot we're going to

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.510 
so statue in this shot we're going to
use<00:01:26.659> a<00:01:26.689> combination<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.409> flash<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.950> ambient

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520

about F 11 let's shoot if you want more
shadow<00:03:22.349> then<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.069> simply<00:03:23.370> place<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.639> flat

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
shadow then you can simply place a flat

just one light one of my favorite ways
of<00:03:40.199> shooting<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.829> balance<00:03:41.010> sunlight<00:03:41.489> with

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
of shooting is to balance sunlight with

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.030 
of shooting is to balance sunlight with

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
one flash head in this example we shot

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.890 
one flash head in this example we shot
the<00:03:44.160> picture<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.669> soldier<00:03:45.000> first<00:03:45.269> without

the picture of the soldier first without
flash<00:03:46.230> then<00:03:46.650> use<00:03:46.889> trial<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.220> error<00:03:47.430> to

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699
