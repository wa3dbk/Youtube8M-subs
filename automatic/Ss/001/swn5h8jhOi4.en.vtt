have helped me get through a knee injury
I've<00:00:52.059> had<00:00:52.269> in<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.960> past<00:00:53.019> four<00:00:53.440> years<00:00:53.519> and<00:00:54.519> also

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
I've had in the past four years and also

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.520 
I've had in the past four years and also
I<00:00:54.850> noticed<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.390> lot<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.690> other<00:00:55.839> benefits<00:00:56.050> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
I noticed a lot of other benefits the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.920 
I noticed a lot of other benefits the
cue<00:00:56.739> ring<00:00:56.949> so<00:00:57.339> let's<00:00:57.970> take<00:00:58.150> a<00:00:58.180> few<00:00:58.420> minutes<00:00:58.540> to

cue ring so let's take a few minutes to

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.259 
cue ring so let's take a few minutes to
go<00:00:59.379> into<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.710> concepts<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.699> various

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
go into the concepts and the various

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.939 
go into the concepts and the various
configurations<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.260> settings<00:01:02.680> that

configurations and the settings that

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.369 
configurations and the settings that
really<00:01:03.879> set<00:01:04.330> these<00:01:04.479> elliptical<00:01:04.960> chain<00:01:05.140> rings

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.969 
really set these elliptical chain rings
apart<00:01:05.680> from<00:01:06.010> everything<00:01:06.729> in<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.880> past<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:08.920> to

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
apart from everything in the past now to

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.310 
apart from everything in the past now to
understand<00:01:09.640> what<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.240> Q<00:01:10.479> ratings<00:01:10.750> do<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.200> you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
understand what the Q ratings do for you

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.039 
understand what the Q ratings do for you
you<00:01:11.650> need<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.979> take<00:01:12.220> step<00:01:12.490> back<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:13.030> look<00:01:13.689> at

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
you need to take step back and look at

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.340 
you need to take step back and look at
the<00:01:14.200> dynamics<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.100> pedal<00:01:15.369> stroke<00:01:16.350> the

what happens in this as you're pedaling

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.169 
what happens in this as you're pedaling
through<00:01:31.960> your<00:01:32.200> stroke<00:01:32.590> there<00:01:33.159> is<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.369> basically

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
through your stroke there is a basically

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.539 
through your stroke there is a basically

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
pedal stroke where the knee is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.510 
pedal stroke where the knee is
vulnerable<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.939> also<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:42.100> where<00:01:42.429> you're

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
vulnerable and also also where you're

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.330 
vulnerable and also also where you're
not<00:01:42.670> producing<00:01:42.850> power<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.770> idea<00:01:45.100> with

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
not producing power and the idea with

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.399 
not producing power and the idea with
the<00:01:45.429> Q<00:01:45.640> rings<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.149> with<00:01:46.539> their<00:01:46.810> elliptical

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
the Q rings is with their elliptical

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.950 
the Q rings is with their elliptical
size<00:01:47.619> here<00:01:47.979> this<00:01:48.249> 53<00:01:48.880> actually<00:01:49.299> stretches<00:01:49.749> to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
size here this 53 actually stretches to

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.130 
size here this 53 actually stretches to
a<00:01:50.219> 56<00:01:51.219> here<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.700> then<00:01:52.270> in<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.509> smallest<00:01:52.899> one

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
a 56 here and then in a smallest one

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.529 
a 56 here and then in a smallest one
that<00:01:53.170> is<00:01:53.380> 51<00:01:53.950> when<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.909> were<00:01:54.999> in<00:01:55.119> your<00:01:55.270> power

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
that is 51 when you were in your power

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.410 
that is 51 when you were in your power
zone<00:01:55.990> here<00:01:56.350> in<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:57.280> chain<00:01:57.490> ring<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:57.909> in<00:01:58.149> is

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
zone here in the chain ring is in is

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.200 
zone here in the chain ring is in is
basically<00:01:58.630> taking<00:01:59.109> advantage<00:01:59.469> of<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.799> and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
basically taking advantage of that and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.120 
basically taking advantage of that and
delivering<00:02:01.210> more<00:02:01.270> power<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.799> in<00:02:03.039> its

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
delivering more power and it is in its

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.580 
delivering more power and it is in its
smaller<00:02:03.549> diameter<00:02:04.389> when<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.139> approach<00:02:05.439> the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
smaller diameter when you approach the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.279 
smaller diameter when you approach the
dead<00:02:05.770> spot<00:02:06.069> helping<00:02:06.999> you<00:02:07.119> accelerate<00:02:07.509> through

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
dead spot helping you accelerate through

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.250 
dead spot helping you accelerate through
that<00:02:08.890> portion<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.610> pedal<00:02:09.910> stroke<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.840> keep

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that portion of the pedal stroke to keep

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.590 
that portion of the pedal stroke to keep
a<00:02:11.410> more<00:02:11.650> consistent<00:02:12.100> smoother<00:02:12.790> power<00:02:13.060> profile

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
a more consistent smoother power profile

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.230 
a more consistent smoother power profile
so<00:02:14.440> that's<00:02:14.620> basically<00:02:15.400> what<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.819> Cure<00:02:16.030> rings

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
so that's basically what the Cure rings

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.010 
so that's basically what the Cure rings
are<00:02:16.569> trying<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.080> accomplish<00:02:17.319> there<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
are trying to accomplish there the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.380 
are trying to accomplish there the
Curie's<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.800> five<00:02:21.459> different<00:02:21.850> positions

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
Curie's have five different positions

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.910 
Curie's have five different positions
for<00:02:23.230> both<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.740> inner<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.340> outer<00:02:24.730> chain<00:02:25.120> ring

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
for both the inner and outer chain ring

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.470 
for both the inner and outer chain ring
this<00:02:26.920> basically<00:02:27.340> allows<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.180> control

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
this basically allows you to control

here in the small ring and if you

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.120 
here in the small ring and if you
typically<00:03:38.360> run<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:41.350> state's<00:03:42.350> seated<00:03:43.010> in

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
typically run in the state's seated in

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.730 
typically run in the state's seated in
the<00:03:43.190> back<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.580> saddle<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.750> without<00:03:45.230> very

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
the back of the saddle and without very

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.890 
the back of the saddle and without very
very<00:03:46.010> high<00:03:46.190> cadence<00:03:46.460> for<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.240> power<00:03:47.450> riders

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
very high cadence for the power riders

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.720 
very high cadence for the power riders
you're<00:03:48.200> gonna<00:03:48.320> basically<00:03:48.560> be<00:03:48.920> leading<00:03:49.520> the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
you're gonna basically be leading the

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.220 
you're gonna basically be leading the
big<00:03:49.910> chain<00:03:50.120> right<00:03:50.240> here<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.600> sending<00:03:50.900> three

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
big chain right here and sending three

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.330 
big chain right here and sending three
so<00:03:52.930> that's<00:03:53.930> how<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.170> adjustments<00:03:54.980> work<00:03:56.200> and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
so that's how the adjustments work and

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.520 
so that's how the adjustments work and
as<00:03:58.340> far<00:03:58.550> as<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.820> big<00:03:59.000> chain<00:03:59.330> ring<00:03:59.540> goes<00:03:59.750> if<00:04:00.140> you

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
as far as the big chain ring goes if you

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.440 
as far as the big chain ring goes if you

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
sitting back in the saddle you can

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.100 
sitting back in the saddle you can
believe<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.870> in<00:04:06.440> 73<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.520> keep<00:04:07.760> your<00:04:08.120> your<00:04:08.810> leg
