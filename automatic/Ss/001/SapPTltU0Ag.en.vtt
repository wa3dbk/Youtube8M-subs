00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
what he was thinking about if you want
to<00:00:59.340> defend<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.730> base<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.270> better<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to defend this base a bit better make it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.009 
to defend this base a bit better make it
something<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> let's<00:01:03.449> delete<00:01:03.840> all

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
something like this so let's delete all

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
something like this so let's delete all
of<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.589> mean<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.580> can't<00:01:05.850> blame<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> guy

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of that I mean you can't blame the guy

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410 
of that I mean you can't blame the guy
for<00:01:06.780> getting<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.350> three-star<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.939> defender

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
for getting a three-star if the defender

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
for getting a three-star if the defender
didn't<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> good<00:01:10.380> job<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.280> he's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
didn't do a good job in that so he's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.929 
didn't do a good job in that so he's
gonna<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:12.049> from<00:01:13.049> those<00:01:13.560> directions<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.790> the
