00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
blue green screens like here I don't

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.509

actually a red hidden behind this door

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.030 
actually a red hidden behind this door
here<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:25.300> if<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.449> were<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.660> do<00:04:26.260> something<00:04:26.290> say

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
here so if I were to do something say

here so if I were to do something say
that<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.419> now<00:04:28.510> see<00:04:28.539> that<00:04:28.720> right<00:04:29.010> if<00:04:30.010> you

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
that you can now see that right if you

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.790 
that you can now see that right if you

it'll<00:04:42.910> just<00:04:43.060> tests

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
it'll just tests
