00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
meantime I'm going to melt my chocolate

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.310 
meantime I'm going to melt my chocolate
chips<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.880> I'm<00:04:26.420> going<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.660> show<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:26.930> how<00:04:27.290> to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
chips and I'm going to show you how to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.350 
chips and I'm going to show you how to
dip<00:04:27.680> them<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.190> then<00:04:28.340> put<00:04:28.550> some<00:04:28.730> toppings<00:04:28.970> on

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
dip them and then put some toppings on

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.530 
dip them and then put some toppings on
them<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.560> if<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.770> saw<00:04:31.040> my<00:04:31.250> video<00:04:31.460> on<00:04:32.360> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
them so if you saw my video on the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.270 
them so if you saw my video on the
differences<00:04:33.050> between<00:04:33.110> chocolate<00:04:33.920> chips<00:04:34.100> and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
differences between chocolate chips and

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.370 
differences between chocolate chips and
baking<00:04:34.610> chocolate<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.300> had<00:04:35.750> said<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.260> if

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
baking chocolate I had said that if

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.860 
baking chocolate I had said that if
you're<00:04:36.500> going<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.740> melt<00:04:37.010> chocolate<00:04:37.310> chips<00:04:37.870> it

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
you're going to melt chocolate chips it

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.570 
you're going to melt chocolate chips it
comes<00:04:39.140> up<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.530> little<00:04:39.800> thicker<00:04:40.100> than<00:04:40.370> when<00:04:40.490> you

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
comes up a little thicker than when you

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.640 
comes up a little thicker than when you
use<00:04:40.730> baking<00:04:41.180> chocolate<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.170> I'm<00:04:42.410> going<00:04:42.590> to

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
use baking chocolate so I'm going to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.230 
use baking chocolate so I'm going to
melt<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:42.980> chocolate<00:04:43.280> for<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.700> pretzels<00:04:44.150> I'm

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
real well it probably will not be

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.800
