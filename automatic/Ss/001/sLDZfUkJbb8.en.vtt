00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.780
 what happens more fans today are the sumo 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.780
 single nou 3 neo from samsung dont know 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 we already have the neo box on the table 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.939
 and good to aim with some countries in the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.849
 box comes the silkscreen putting no 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.880
 three neo as it is in this case and in others 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.920
 they put three little I think that Spain 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.710
 called little stay if I'm not wrong is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.020
 of hungary by software that's why he puts 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.200
 they put eo but let's go to the device is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 exactly the same as it is a finish 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.010
 wood type as in other phones 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.180
 samsung and good the box is something 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 different than what it is in s 5 13 s 4 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 since it does not open by pulling up 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 but it opens up let's say it's a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.079
 little bit more crappy opens up the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.089
 next form 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.499
 well I received the mobile yesterday I was 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.140
 testing the experience has been very 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.309
 good then I'll comment and well what 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.620
 first we have when we open the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.900
 box logically is the terminal 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.710
 then we are taught the differences that 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.270
 have with the 3 and that is the plastic that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.270
 it was covering the screen 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.200
 Here we have guarantee and fast start 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200
 the rest 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.400
 in this bag came the battery 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.430
 we have the taquitos for the ears for 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.310
 that can be adjusted 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.360
 headphones the same ones that bring others 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 samsung phones 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.430
 here we have some tips to be able 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.080
 wait and the pieces to get it out 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.080
 exactly like bringing 3 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.990
 microusb cable 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.670
 and power adapter is exactly 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.439
 the same one that brings the s5 nou 3s 4 a 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.000
 output of 2 amps that was very very 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.740
 all right 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.740
 so we are a little mobile 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680
 nou 3 neo and measures 14.8 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.380
 centimeters high 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.429
 77 centimeters wide and 8.6 millimeters 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.890
 thick 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.750
 all 162 grams in when 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.960
 technical specifications has a 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.870
 5.5 inch super amoled screen hd 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.600
 and a density of 265 pixels per 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.900
 inch an extra core exynos processor 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.910
 to 1.7 gigahertz and 2 gigas of ram a 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.950
 16 GB expandable internal memory 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.660
 by micro sd a front camera 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.970
 of 2 megapixels and rear of 8 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.100
 megapixels and a battery of 3,100 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.959
 miles we have the black on the table 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.280
 and I'm going to show you how it is and the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.890
 I say what are the physical differences 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.980
 with the nou 3 to start up we have 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.570
 the the headset camera sensors to the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.840
 right and that of notifications to the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.790
 left down we have a physical button 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.459
 and two back and menu touchs 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.540
 As you can see, the front is exactly the same 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.329
 that in the 3 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.890
 part of top we have the porte 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.489
 infrared cancel microphone 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.599
 headphone port left side 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.920
 we find the engines of 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.750
 volume 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.349
 bottom part we have the microphone 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.900
 microusb speaker input and the on the 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.060
 entrance to the spain 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.819
 and finally on the right side we have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.030
 the on and off button like 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.420
 You see the frame is silver just like it was 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.900
 the north but he did not like a 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.470
 kind of drawing a few lines was not a 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.349
 drawing was the frame that I had towards asia 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.049
 some lines in this as you see is it is smooth 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.730
 can be said then separately in the nou 3 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.099
 will be more brighter in this is more 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.500
 matte back we have the camera 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.750
 up the flash a different way to the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.760
 I had in Nou 3 if you remember 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 it was a more square shape and 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.079
 came all attached to camera and flash is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.420
 as you see comes comes divided we have 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.040
 the samson graphs and finished in 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.030
 plastic as in the three 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.220
 also kind skin type and good around 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.049
 Well, you have that route, although it is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.750
 plastic in which I do not invite anything 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.220
 as if it were a seam what advantages 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.950
 has this mobile with respect to the three 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.689
 the first thing is the software regarding the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.370
 spin is exactly the same software 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.560
 you will be able to do the same with this 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.600
 device that with the nou 3 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.190
 autonomy greater autonomy although the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.350
 battery is welcome 'amps less 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.200
 but the screen is a little bit more 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.080
 small 0.2 inches less and the 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.870
 resolution is hd instead of full hd what 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.760
 which makes autonomy greater and 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.770
 being a screen a little bit more 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.520
 small the mobile is smaller and less 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.960
 manageable which is fine too 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.419
 what's wrong with nou 3 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.850
 First of all it has two ram twists 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.470
 instead of three you have to say that I 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.229
 until now I have been giving a lot of cane 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.300
 from yesterday to today in kind that had it and 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.430
 The truth is that you have not noticed anything 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 kind of the deceased with which this is 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.650
 a difference that I say good 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.810
 to say something that is true is that in the 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.510
 performance so far no no I 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.889
 it affects that difference of ram for nothing 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:11.560
 another thing is the screen as I said 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:13.300
 it's hd and in the nou it's full hd but he wants 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.970
 say that the difference is minimal is 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.040
 note something but if you're not very multi 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.230
 he wrote with the screen the truth that 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.510
 the difference is minimal 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.400
 and another thing against is the camera in the 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.310
 nou 3 we have a camera of 3 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.990
 megapixels here is 8 but not by 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.970
 it means that it is worse yet not what 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.090
 I have tried but good in future tests 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.670
 I'll do photos and so on and we'll see 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.690
 how does it work out that you know 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.250
 that this does not record on 4 channel nou 3 if 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.580
 this mobile abound that does not have radio fm 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.850
 and finally say that the price is 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.700
 you can find up to 150 euros more 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:55.120
 format that the what 3 from my point 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.880
 of view if I'm looking for a know 3 no 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.410
 you have enough money to 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.480
 pay it or it's the first time that Aisha 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.480
 brownlow and you do not know what you're going to like 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.610
 experience and such is a very model 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.970
 recommended before buying a know 3 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.030
 even if it's second hand that's going to 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.740
 cost even more expensive than this stereo 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.580
 I recommend buying this best new 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.920
 sealed and you will be able to experience 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.510
 what it feels like with a normal 3 know and 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.460
 current this all on the screen like 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.870
 I said but I'm telling you that you are going to 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.950
 have the same user experience 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.010
 that with 13 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.050
 so up to here the unboxing in the 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.020
 first impressions and the following 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.610
 videos I'll make comparisons with black 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.610
 us in the next video
