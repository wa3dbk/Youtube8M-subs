00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:08.834
 We see one of the paintings of the 1962 series of paintings. 

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:13.674
 of Campbell soup cans by Andy Warhol, exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 

00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:18.458
 And one of the really important issues that pop up when it comes to modern art, 

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.112
 is "Why is Art?" 

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:24.684
 When you ask me this, a whole bunch of things come to my mind. 

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:28.410
 This really awakens something in me, so I have to say "yes, art is" 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.744
 but a bunch of other things tell me that if I had not seen this in a museum, 

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:35.060
 but simply in the marketing department of "Soup Campbell" 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.952
 then would I have looked at it differently? 

00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:38.715
 Because then it is advertising. - Yes. 

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:42.644
 But in the context of the museum, in the context of Andy Warhol's studio, 

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:44.969
 this is no longer an ad, is it? 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.519
 Even if it is exactly the same thing. - Yes. 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.857
 And the idea here is that by putting it in the museum, it already says 

00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:52.277
 "Look at it in a different way." 

00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:54.930
 Yes, it is. It really changes its place, 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.838
 changes its meaning, transforms it, 

00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:00.241
 and this is one of the main ideas of modern art. 

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.232
 That is, you really can take something, 

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:05.537
 which does not necessarily reveal technical skills - 

00:01:05.537 --> 00:01:06.786
 because I do not think you will say, 

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:08.102
 that it is very beautifully presented - It is. 

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:11.752
 - but to change his place and make us think about it in another way. 

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.961
 I suppose he will be appreciated for taking something, 

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.777
 which was very simple, banal, something you see 

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:21.642
 in the kitchen cabinet, and has turned it into a central point. 

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.834
 He seems to have said, "You have to pay attention to this." 

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.950
 I think that's right. And he does it for a theme, 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.057
 as trivial as a trivial theme could be. 

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:34.579
 The cheap art of advertising has been so far away 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.476
 of the fine art, of the great masters, 

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:41.173
 and here we are heartfelt on something as simple as a soup in a can, 

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:43.845
 even chicken soup cream. 

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.426
 And I mean, 

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:53.631
 that there are many things that if he had done 50 years earlier, many people would think it crazy. 

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:55.502
 And if you do them now, they'll just think it's not original. 

00:01:55.502 --> 00:01:57.676
 That is, then, people accidentally begin to regard this as art. 

00:01:57.676 --> 00:01:59.028
 Yes it's true. 

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:07.031
 In 1962, what Warhol does does show what is really important and inherent in our culture, 

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.577
 and it is the mass production, the factory. 

00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:15.003
 In this sense, he says not to look at nature as an agrarian culture does, 

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:17.114
 because we are an industrial culture. 

00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:20.151
 What are the things in our lives now? 

00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:21.879
 I understand 80%. 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.062
 I remember there was an exhibition organized by students when I was in college. 

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:30.898
 One student made a joke - put a small puff and put a tray on top for lunch. 

00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:33.701
 On the nameplate, he writes "Tray for lunch on Saturday". 

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:37.458
 So he joked and everyone found it funny, 

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:40.778
 but to some extent what he did was really art. 

00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:43.240
 It was funny because it's so close. 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.116
 And at some point when someone took the tray, put proper lighting, 

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:50.832
 put him on the podium and even wrote an explanatory description about him, 

00:02:50.832 --> 00:02:53.037
 I really looked at this tray in a different way. 

00:02:53.037 --> 00:02:56.661
 The idea is the same. Something is trivial, but you use it everyday and so ... 

00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.448
 What do you think? Was this a tease or art? 

00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:03.451
 I think it was a tease but very close to important works of art from the early years of the century. 

00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:08.387
 He is allowed to do this thanks to a man named Marcel Duchamp. 

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:14.527
 In fact, Warhol had the same permission - not to focus on doing something, 

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:18.650
 not to focus on brush, composition or color work, 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.328
 but on ideas. 

00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:27.025
 The reason to talk about Warhol, Duchamp or anyone, 

00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:29.765
 is, as you say, not that they have created something deep as a technique. 

00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:35.196
 The marketing department of Soupi Campbell has already done something insightful enough. 

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:40.807
 It is a question that they were people who look at the world differently and underline this. 

00:03:40.807 --> 00:03:47.469
 Yes, it is. Warhol deliberately works in this direction, asks the same questions, 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.106
 which your fellow joker asks. 

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:52.619
 He asks, "Could this be an art?" 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:54.581
 And it really does. 

00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:56.277
 Take a close look at the picture for a moment. 

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.873
 This is one of the last paintings he draws. 

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:02.540
 He clearly expresses the inscription "Soup Campbell" 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.973
 the glow on top of the can. 

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:09.798
 And there he stops, says he does not want to paint the little motifs of lilies. 

00:04:09.798 --> 00:04:11.698
 Do you see the small heraldic lilies on the bottom? 

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:18.032
 He said he did not want to paint them, so he ordered a rubber stamp and put it mechanically. 

00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:22.042
 What does this mean for an artist - to say he does not even want to paint these things? 

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:25.114
 That he would simply find a mechanical process to make it easier? 

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:28.615
 Warhol does something important that reflects the way, 

00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:31.550
 through which we produce, build the world, 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.661
 we think about the things that surround us. 

00:04:35.661 --> 00:04:38.116
 Almost everything is made in a factory. 

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:40.324
 Almost nothing in the world is no longer the only one. 

00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:43.361
 It is not a world we will usually find beautiful. 

00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:47.298
 Fix me if I'm wrong, but sometimes I have the feeling that someone has decided 

00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:50.005
 whether Warhol is interesting or great, 

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:54.249
 and people interpret his works so as to justify this majesty. 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:59.206
 "Oh, he uses a printer instead of painting, which shows that ..." 

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:00.747
 reflects ... 

00:05:00.747 --> 00:05:06.212
 But if he had done it the other way, he had painted his hands, even with his elbow, 

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:08.611
 with fingers or something, 

00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:11.779
 people would say, "That's great, we usually see this printed with a machine, 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.892
 and he painted it with his own hands. " 

00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:16.694
 How much do you think this is about? Or am I just too cynical? 

00:05:16.694 --> 00:05:20.867
 No, I think cynicity to a certain extent is worth. 

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:24.779
 And I think that what really matters is: 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.707
 What does it mean to be an avant-garde artist? 

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:32.157
 What it means to change the language of art and look for a way to reflect the current historical moment 

00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:36.541
 in some direct and original way? 

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:40.254
 And maybe it's easy for me to say it because I remember 

00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:44.449
 how did I look at this painting in fifth grade class art, 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.616
 and now it seems to me not so unique. 

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:53.902
 But as far as I know, in the 62nd Warhol was really remarkable because it caused people's thinking. 

00:05:53.902 --> 00:05:58.281
 I think in 1962 Warhol was looking for a subject, 

00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:02.704
 which is entirely outside the context of what we would consider art. 

00:06:02.704 --> 00:06:06.545
 And one of his contemporaries, Roy Liechtenstein, was asked to make a definition of a parrot 

00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:11.662
 and said they were actually looking for a topic that was so pathetic, 

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:14.443
 that no one believes that it is art. 

00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:18.445
 I think you are right and that has so far become part of our visual culture, 

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:20.729
 that we have already accepted it. 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:28.869
 This is fascinating! There is a lot of potential in this. 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:35.650
 This is a pseudo-art created for other purposes, but if you point the spotlight on it ... 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.375
 The way they were directed to that. 

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:42.580
 In your mind this crosses the border of art? 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.709
 I think, as I have already mentioned, that if someone does it now, it will look neo-original. 

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:54.358
 That is how, it highlights how difficult it is now in our culture 

00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:57.359
 to find something to show us a new look at the world. 

00:06:57.359 --> 00:06:59.866
 Yes, charming.
