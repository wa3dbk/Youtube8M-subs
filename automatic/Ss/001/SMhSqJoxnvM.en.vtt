00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
but basically I just apply this all over

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.920 
but basically I just apply this all over
my<00:01:06.720> face<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> reason<00:01:09.330> why<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
my face and the reason why I do that is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
my face and the reason why I do that is
because<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:12.420> color<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.220> know<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
because this color you know well the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
because this color you know well the
reason<00:01:15.180> why<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> darker<00:01:15.869> color<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
reason why I take a darker color is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
reason why I take a darker color is
because<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.060> face<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> match<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.720> body

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
because I want my face to match my body

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.289 
because I want my face to match my body
it's<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.729> put<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.900> of
