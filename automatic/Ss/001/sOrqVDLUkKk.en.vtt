it's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.549> land<00:01:32.759> party<00:01:33.060> computer<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.810> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it's a land party computer so if this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's a land party computer so if this
Drive<00:01:34.259> dies<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:34.710> gets<00:01:34.770> bad<00:01:35.009> sectors<00:01:35.400> or

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
Drive dies or gets bad sectors or

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.940 
Drive dies or gets bad sectors or
something<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.140> gonna<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> big<00:01:37.770> deal

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

something it's not gonna be a big deal
it<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:39.060> won't<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.150> experiment

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it it won't be so I put in I experiment

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.520 
it it won't be so I put in I experiment
with<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.390> sort<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.659> stuff<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.140> non

with this sort of stuff in a non

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.999 
with this sort of stuff in a non
mission-critical<00:01:44.100> computer<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.860> know

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
mission-critical computer so I know

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.300 
mission-critical computer so I know
Seagate's<00:01:47.549> warranties<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.740> RMA<00:01:49.740> service<00:01:50.159> is

Seagate's warranties and RMA service is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.069 
Seagate's warranties and RMA service is
very<00:01:50.520> good<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.090> hopefully<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.630> hard<00:01:51.780> drives

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
very good so hopefully the hard drives

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.649 
very good so hopefully the hard drives
are<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.220> good<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> Seagate<00:01:54.090> C<00:01:54.450> gates

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
are just as good I know Seagate C gates

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
are just as good I know Seagate C gates
do<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> highest<00:01:55.290> failure<00:01:55.799> rate<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> any

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
do have the highest failure rate of any

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
do have the highest failure rate of any

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
hard drive manufacturers out there but I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.020 
hard drive manufacturers out there but I
still<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.040> fun<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.670> try

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
still think it's fun to you know try

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.289 
still think it's fun to you know try
things<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.020> haven't<00:02:01.469> used<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:02.399> new<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
things out and I haven't used a new the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.580 
things out and I haven't used a new the
only<00:02:03.479> new<00:02:03.600> Seagate<00:02:03.960> drives<00:02:04.200> I've<00:02:04.380> really<00:02:04.560> used

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
only new Seagate drives I've really used

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.959 
only new Seagate drives I've really used
up<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> notebook<00:02:05.280> ones<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.579> haven't<00:02:05.850> used

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
up in the notebook ones I haven't used

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389 
up in the notebook ones I haven't used
any<00:02:06.090> new<00:02:06.329> desktop<00:02:06.960> ones<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> long<00:02:07.649> time<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.220> I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
any new desktop ones in a long time so I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.999 
any new desktop ones in a long time so I
think<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.149> about<00:02:09.330> overdue<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> give<00:02:10.860> one

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
think it's about overdue that I give one

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.830 
think it's about overdue that I give one
of<00:02:11.069> these<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> try<00:02:11.459> again<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.629> fun

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
of these a try again just just for fun

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.980

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
one terabyte drive in here and install

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.490 
one terabyte drive in here and install
Windows<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.270> guys<00:02:29.420> know<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.930> drill<00:02:30.080> so

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
Windows on it you guys know the drill so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.440 
Windows on it you guys know the drill so
this<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.490> short<00:02:31.700> video<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.000> update<00:02:32.210> you

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
this is just a short video to update you

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.490 
this is just a short video to update you
guys<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.630> what's<00:02:32.960> happening<00:02:33.260> with<00:02:33.350> this

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
guys on what's happening with this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.410 
guys on what's happening with this
computer<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.130> some<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:34.970> stupid<00:02:35.390> things

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
computer and some of the stupid things

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.280 
computer and some of the stupid things
event<00:02:35.870> go<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.740> with<00:02:36.920> it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
event go on with it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.830 
event go on with it
so<00:02:39.290> yeah<00:02:39.590> instead<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.730> 500<00:02:41.210> gig<00:02:41.300> drive<00:02:41.540> I'm

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
so yeah instead of a 500 gig drive I'm

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.540 
so yeah instead of a 500 gig drive I'm
adding<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.350> terabyte<00:02:42.560> drive<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.250> it

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
adding a one terabyte drive to it

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.310 
adding a one terabyte drive to it
so<00:02:43.730> hopefully<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.450> drive<00:02:44.690> holds<00:02:44.930> up<00:02:45.170> for

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
so hopefully this drive holds up for

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.750 
so hopefully this drive holds up for
quite<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> while<00:02:47.200> one<00:02:48.200> thing<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.740> also<00:02:49.250> might<00:02:49.550> do

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
quite a while one thing I also might do

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.600 
quite a while one thing I also might do
is<00:02:50.000> stick<00:02:50.270> this<00:02:50.570> lg<00:02:51.110> drive<00:02:51.490> into<00:02:52.490> there

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
is stick this lg drive into there

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.730 
is stick this lg drive into there
because<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:53.030> HP<00:02:53.500> LightScribe<00:02:54.500> drive

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
because this HP LightScribe drive

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.380 
because this HP LightScribe drive
sometimes<00:02:55.160> doesn't<00:02:55.490> read<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.700> disk<00:02:55.880> properly

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
sometimes doesn't read the disk properly

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.080 
sometimes doesn't read the disk properly
so<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.600> might<00:02:57.020> go<00:02:57.200> in<00:02:57.350> there<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:58.670> probably

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
so that might go in there it probably

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.370 
so that might go in there it probably
will<00:02:59.270> if<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.510> get<00:02:59.570> fed<00:02:59.870> up<00:02:59.900> with<00:03:00.110> trying<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
will if I get fed up with trying to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.700 
will if I get fed up with trying to
install<00:03:00.650> Windows<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:03.170> know<00:03:03.290> that's<00:03:03.530> how

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
install Windows so you know that's how

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.100 
install Windows so you know that's how
things<00:03:03.950> go<00:03:04.240> that's<00:03:05.240> probably<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.840> will<00:03:05.960> end

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
things go that's probably what will end

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.200 
things go that's probably what will end
up<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:06.620> more<00:03:07.130> than<00:03:07.280> likely<00:03:07.490> yeah<00:03:07.760> sorry
