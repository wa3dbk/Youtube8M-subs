could take them but the pictures end up
really<00:02:23.620> really<00:02:24.099> dark<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:25.060> met

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
really really dark we met

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.399 
really really dark we met
with<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.640> brightness<00:02:25.939> and<00:02:26.390> everything<00:02:26.840> they

with the brightness and everything they

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.100 
with the brightness and everything they
end<00:02:27.590> up<00:02:27.709> really<00:02:28.040> really<00:02:28.340> dark<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.810> never

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
end up really really dark and I never

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.740 
end up really really dark and I never
use<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.409> I<00:02:30.799> used<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.489> AV<00:02:31.909> for<00:02:32.150> motion<00:02:32.510> shot

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
use that I used the AV for motion shot

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.640 
use that I used the AV for motion shot
or<00:02:32.959> action<00:02:33.590> shots<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.129> but<00:02:34.599> yeah<00:02:35.599> so<00:02:36.170> anyway

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
or action shots now but yeah so anyway

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.390 
or action shots now but yeah so anyway
this<00:02:36.799> camera<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.310> very<00:02:37.730> lightweight<00:02:38.329> I<00:02:38.870> guess

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
this camera is very lightweight I guess

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.280 
this camera is very lightweight I guess
most<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.519> y'all<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.060> one<00:02:41.299> thing<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.599> also<00:02:41.989> I

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
most of y'all but the one thing I also I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.160 
most of y'all but the one thing I also I
don't<00:02:42.620> like<00:02:42.799> what<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.459> replace<00:02:43.939> too<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.140> I

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
don't like what you can replace too so I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.449 
don't like what you can replace too so I
guess<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:46.040> it's<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:47.470> little<00:02:48.470> strap<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.220> comes

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
guess but it's the little strap it comes

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.369 
guess but it's the little strap it comes
with<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.650> kind<00:02:52.189> of<00:02:52.370> doesn't<00:02:52.939> this<00:02:53.599> is<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:54.109> that

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
with it kind of doesn't this is all that

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.059 
with it kind of doesn't this is all that
is<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> full<00:02:56.629> leather<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.650> doesn't

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
is it's like a full leather it doesn't

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.089 
is it's like a full leather it doesn't
really<00:02:58.430> it's<00:02:59.359> not<00:02:59.629> come<00:02:59.989> from<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.769> actually

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
really it's not come from it actually

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.309 
really it's not come from it actually
hurts<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:02.030> doesn't<00:03:02.420> it's<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:02.930> just

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
hurts it doesn't it's not just

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.849 
hurts it doesn't it's not just
uncomfortable<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:04.250> hurts<00:03:04.280> me<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
uncomfortable it hurts me so I I have to

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.349 
uncomfortable it hurts me so I I have to
have<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.040> on<00:03:07.400> my<00:03:07.430> neck<00:03:07.549> if<00:03:07.879> I<00:03:07.970> use<00:03:08.209> this

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359

camera<00:03:08.659> so<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.470> don't<00:03:09.739> drop<00:03:10.099> it<00:03:10.129> just<00:03:10.639> for<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
camera so I don't drop it just for the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.270 
camera so I don't drop it just for the
safety<00:03:11.120> purposes<00:03:11.959> because<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.829> camera

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
safety purposes because this camera

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.369 
safety purposes because this camera
costs<00:03:13.790> more<00:03:14.120> than<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.540> thousand<00:03:15.049> dollars

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379

um autofocus great the main the main

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.670 
um autofocus great the main the main
the<00:04:35.880> pros<00:04:36.210> are<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.930> captures<00:04:37.470> them

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the pros are that it captures them
