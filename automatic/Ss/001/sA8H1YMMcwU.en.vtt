00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 and painful 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.870
 because I think it is 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.230
 that we did enough to be able 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.230
 win the match 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.100
 and a classic 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.380
 but good pulling conclusion I think 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.390
 that it was not the elimination there is no yes I think 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.730
 that was the concrete match I think 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.250
 we are superior america to a very rival 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.700
 complicated 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.350
 Good players 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.640
 but with the feeling a bittersweet taste 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.710
 I think that a good match is what I do not 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.510
 I like to call the failure 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.260
 we face two tournaments with a lot 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.640
 integrity whenever we did we defended 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.010
 the colors of feeling the best 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.379
 way I think you already saw you and 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 we also felt there was a 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 huge improvement inside the court 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.760
 and I think that with that we have to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 we still have a tournament by 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.440
 play that is going to be complicated is going to be 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.820
 difficult but I think that for what it is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.580
 showing the team with that we do not have 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.290
 that that removal is very painful 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 but I particularly was very 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.780
 happy with my team and really 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.149
 we have to prove it in another side 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 but the truth is that I feel very 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.659
 proud of this group of players my 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.549
 work is going to magnify if I something 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.219
 that the team plays well is who 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.159
 be with everything and injuries and with everything 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:36.450
 what this entails and the truth is that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.880
 I did not do a great job and well now 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 We are paying for sample removal 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.240
 excuse me but you always want 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.119
 they play like football 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.399
 and little wanted to ever lose anyone 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 nobody we wanted to win too 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.460
 today and good the reality is that we are 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.500
 outside but for no reason can you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.929
 think about that young players 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.079
 they leave something to do they leave it for another 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.079
 day
