00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hi everyone , my name is people and today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
 tutorial will be a little different 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.750
 You're going to see me, maqueano, I'm keeping 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.330
 the bia 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 I'm passing a shadow on the concave 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 to mark it and place it on the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.010
 I'm going through both eyes now 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.550
 I'm outta here now with a cotton swab 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.810
 the excessive shade at the end 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.610
 I always make up both eyes. 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.670
 simultaneously 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.879
 this helps with the issue of asymmetry 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 now I'm passing a clear shadow on the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.780
 her eyelid 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 this kind of makeup that I'm 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.809
 doing a makeup called kate 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.820
 which is the most marked concave and the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.789
 Lighter moving eyelid is a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.289
 makeup that looks great for the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.359
 her biotype 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.600
 Now I'm passing a pencil. 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.090
 universal eyebrow eyebrow 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:11.189
 Now I'm combing my eyebrows 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.119
 her to look beautiful eyebrow 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.230
 beautiful is superimportante the makeup 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:23.030
 because the eyebrow she is very hard 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.000
 to look at now I'm going from 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.740
 a slight pull in this outline 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 so I'll explain to you why 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.450
 that the choice of flowers why I 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.270
 I chose the beautiful one has the green eyes then 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.150
 green eyes look very beautiful with 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.310
 purple shadows with wine shadows 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.080
 sparkling wines with black colors 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.230
 outlined in her case was super 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.260
 beautiful because it marked more look and the 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:56.200
 black defined her look more than she 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.200
 has green eyes was pretty cool 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.640
 I am now going eyeliner always 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.560
 oil to visit as my hand is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.240
 dirty you saw also dirty mounts 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.410
 because I take the product I take the excess 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.510
 in hand 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.500
 I never put the product directly from the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.650
 cut because if it does not lick you 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.090
 always have to take the excess 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.070
 Now I'm passing the white pencil on the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.160
 because I wanted to like her 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.110
 this makeup was going to be a filming I 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.110
 I wanted her eyes to look good. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 open very bright she has no eyes 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.520
 their eyes are normal but their 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.450
 even so I wanted to leave the larger ones 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.910
 and then I'm passing in the shade 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.760
 I was in the inner corner now , I'm 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.590
 passing an illuminating shadow to 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.290
 open the look you wanted by looking at her 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.230
 stay well open 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.260
 I'm cleaning up the excess shade that 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.660
 fell now I always do the first 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.550
 eye after I make the skin 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.160
 this really depends on each 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.560
 makeup artist does not exist a rule ones do 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.819
 the first others skin make an eye 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 first 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.599
 Now I'm passing rhyme, I went through with 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.500
 many layers 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.840
 Only in the matter of skin I prefer 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.430
 do afterwards because of fault work 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.349
 because sometimes it falls shadows if I 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.900
 made the skin before I would have to take 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.599
 clean and then pass to the base of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.610
 new and play so I'd rather do 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.310
 this way because it saves my time and 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.250
 save product too now I'm 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.870
 passing primer on her for me product 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.720
 super important in makeup 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.560
 mainly professional makeup 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.209
 because I wanted this makeup 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.269
 last a lot 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.319
 even more so because she was going to shoot 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.269
 has the whole issue of light in her face and 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.139
 sometimes it's a makeup starts to 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.900
 to melt 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.530
 so the more products you pass 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.840
 for this to last will be better 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.660
 so I'm passing the base with the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.290
 fire brush in his of the fable is the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.780
 Brush double double bristle he leaves 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.229
 most natural look on the skin does not leave 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:18.310
 that cement-like skin knows 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.650
 that heavy skin I wanted her 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.990
 It was very light and I had no problem. 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.960
 with her skin because she has no skin 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.200
 problem has no stains did not have 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.330
 nothing for this 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.690
 so I just passed the base and the concealer 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.870
 I did not even have a colored 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.210
 I did not have to cover a stain 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.880
 finally no imperfection of her skin 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.940
 because also a very young skin then 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.400
 I did not have this problem now passing 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.710
 corrective I step positive with the brush 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.310
 and paÃ§o also with finger because the finger it 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.500
 warm the product and it helps to sit 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.120
 this product on her skin because I 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.240
 I did not want them to stay 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.070
 so I made a point of settling very well 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.820
 Now I'm going through the whole face. 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.270
 to modify this taste to become a 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.850
 little more opaque and hold everything 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.700
 that I put down look help to 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.180
 also to help with the issue of 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.180
 oiliness 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.890
 I am now going on in the region is 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:28.120
 her illuminator was well dominated by 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.120
 pretty skin 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.880
 in a sport enough to also stay 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.280
 concentrated the product does not stay that 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:44.320
 That thing is fake. 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.870
 now I'm passing in outline 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.480
 it does not require as much contour but 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.450
 It's even simple to tune it because it 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.080
 does not have an already prominent scholarship she has 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.840
 a face a creek 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.160
 but still a contour for video is 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.010
 great 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:09.180
 using outlines on filming stays very 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:13.900
 cool have to spread well not to stay 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:16.030
 marked is now next blush due 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.790
 the skin tone I chose Brazil 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.220
 blush that palette month crossing garney 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.840
 that the flash 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.230
 I think it was gonna let all 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.419
 products used in it down here 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.580
 Now I'm putting lipstick on your lips. 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.220
 her 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:37.750
 I skirted my lips first because I 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:41.229
 I passed the button and in the middle of her lips. 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:45.070
 I spent some lip gloss to give 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:48.430
 that one made of fleshy lips of the 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:51.660
 Lips bigger only in the middle I passed 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.660
 the blog 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.520
 It was really cool but that bia liked the 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:04.469
 final result 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.479
 She liked it too and I hope you 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:09.449
 you also liked it personally 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:12.090
 If you like, click I like it for me. 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:17.939
 the final result is in the 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:19.340
 My channel, a kiss to you and even the 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:23.030
 next 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.030
 already all
