00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.449
 it is possible that there were ships 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.870
 aliens circulating near the 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.239
 surface of the sun apparently this is 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.399
 a long shot because 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.530
 the sun is a million degrees 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.260
 centigrade notwithstanding neither 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.909
 We should surprise us much considering 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.010
 account the degree of development that 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.290
 could have the aliens that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.530
 could they create a kind of 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.989
 ship capable of supporting that energy and not 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.320
 only to endure it but to absorb 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.710
 the and use it to move 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.079
 today I will present a photo 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.530
 awesome a photo that as you can 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.500
 see it includes the sun and in the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.740
 surface of the sun we can see a 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.040
 sort of exaro and to the right has 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.920
 marked with an arrow a ship 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.259
 extraterrestrial one of a size more 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 big that the earth would be a ship 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.560
 gigantic 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.410
 many people say that this image 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.260
 is tricked that is really a fault 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.450
 from the camera but I will deny this 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.300
 because there is no failure of the camera 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.600
 if the camera had failed and if 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.600
 I would have pixelated the image 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 that you have there the hexagon that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 kind of hexahedron sorry 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.000
 because it would be pixelated let's say all the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.880
 area of the surface of the sun also 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.540
 but the image looks clearly as if 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.760
 the object was just behind right 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.610
 behind the sun 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.490
 if the image was pixelated, part 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.750
 of the sun would also be pixelated but it's 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.360
 curious how limited the sun is 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.630
 which makes me think about 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.190
 of whether this photo is true or lies 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.310
 true is that it is a photo that has been 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.050
 captured very close to the sun has been captured 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.290
 recently we still have to investigate 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.600
 a lot about it you can find it 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.630
 if you look for it you just have to put 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.170
 hexahedron hexahedron near the sun and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.930
 surely the image will come out and good 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.330
 I hope that with everyone's help we can 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.060
 come to a conclusion about what 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.209
 it is truly this is clearly not 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.690
 is something normal is not the first 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.550
 UFO sighting near the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.310
 sun there have been many more sightings 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.890
 in fact I will surely have already put 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.800
 one in the channel with which I do not know 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.920
 it's about an isolated incident it's about 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.950
 already of many incidents that demonstrate 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.790
 the possible existence of extraterrestrials 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.650
 near the sun which is perfectly 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.560
 understandable because the sun is a source 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.380
 of practically inexhaustible energy and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.340
 can serve to supply your ships 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.340
 everything you want
