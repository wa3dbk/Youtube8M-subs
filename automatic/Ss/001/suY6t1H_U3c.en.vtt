a vital plumbing system for any building

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.300 
a vital plumbing system for any building
is<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.720> fire<00:00:03.899> protection<00:00:04.170> system<00:00:04.830> which<00:00:05.130> we

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
is the fire protection system which we

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.730 
is the fire protection system which we
will<00:00:05.400> model<00:00:05.700> here<00:00:06.029> we'll<00:00:06.990> begin<00:00:07.140> by<00:00:07.560> adding

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
will model here we'll begin by adding

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.970

elevator shaft the ceiling object will
be<00:00:50.050> detected<00:00:50.380> so<00:00:50.860> that<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.100> sprinklers<00:00:51.550> are

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
be detected so that the sprinklers are

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.880 
be detected so that the sprinklers are
modeled<00:00:52.120> at<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.510> matching<00:00:52.900> elevation<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:59.710> can

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
modeled at the matching elevation we can

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.170 
modeled at the matching elevation we can
confirm<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.310> they<00:01:00.550> were<00:01:00.610> placed<00:01:00.910> in<00:01:01.090> a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
confirm that they were placed in a

confirm that they were placed in a
nine-foot<00:01:01.660> elevation<00:01:02.200> just<00:01:02.410> as<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.400> ceiling

correctly this sprinkler system will

correctly this sprinkler system will
