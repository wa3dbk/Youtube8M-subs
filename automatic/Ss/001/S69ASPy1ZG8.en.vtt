00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
steam vent so that way none of the smoke

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.430 
steam vent so that way none of the smoke
can<00:02:16.160> escape<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.730> all<00:02:16.940> stays<00:02:17.299> in<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.019> I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
once all the smoke has sort of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.640 
once all the smoke has sort of
dissipated<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:23.780> really<00:02:24.049> absorbed<00:02:24.500> into

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650
