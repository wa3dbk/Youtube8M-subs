it<00:01:05.570> um<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.860> would<00:01:07.159> say<00:01:07.189> a<00:01:07.400> lot<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.640> people<00:01:07.850> just

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
it um I would say a lot of people just

look<00:01:08.180> at<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.450> they<00:01:08.540> see<00:01:08.780> just<00:01:09.020> the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110

physical aspect of that but I really

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.390 
physical aspect of that but I really
think<00:01:10.820> it's<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.240> discipline<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:12.590> works<00:01:13.159> at

think it's a discipline that works at

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.740 
think it's a discipline that works at
developing<00:01:14.119> ones

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
developing ones

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.719

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
but starting pulling that right back to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.790 
but starting pulling that right back to
the<00:01:36.920> basic<00:01:37.370> moves<00:01:37.870> if<00:01:38.870> when<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.170> first<00:01:39.470> started

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
the basic moves if when I first started

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.770 
the basic moves if when I first started
a<00:01:39.979> simple<00:01:40.729> move<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:41.210> jumping<00:01:41.510> over<00:01:41.750> a

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
a simple move of just jumping over a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.289 
a simple move of just jumping over a
rail<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.290> was<00:01:42.710> scary<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.130> me<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.909> have<00:01:44.150> to

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
rail that was scary to me so you have to

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.440 
rail that was scary to me so you have to
learn<00:01:44.690> how<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:44.960> manage<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.620> fear<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:47.270> that's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
learn how to manage your fear so that's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120 
learn how to manage your fear so that's
a<00:01:47.510> mental<00:01:47.690> aspect<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:48.680> obviously<00:01:49.040> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
a mental aspect then obviously the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.560 
a mental aspect then obviously the
physical<00:01:49.250> aspect<00:01:49.820> because<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> lot<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
physical aspect because a lot of the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.140 
physical aspect because a lot of the
moves<00:01:50.780> require<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.440> lot<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.760> coordination<00:01:52.760> that

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
moves require a lot of coordination that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.780 
moves require a lot of coordination that
requires<00:01:53.870> balance<00:01:54.290> my<00:01:54.500> strength<00:01:55.190> so<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.700> have

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
requires balance my strength so you have

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.940 
requires balance my strength so you have
to<00:01:55.880> develop<00:01:56.090> yourself<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.630> way<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.380> then

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
to develop yourself that way and then

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.210 
to develop yourself that way and then

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
get flow when you join movements

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.570 
get flow when you join movements
together<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.379> this<00:02:12.560> nice<00:02:12.799> flowing

really<00:02:25.450> really<00:02:25.690> spiritual<00:02:26.350> experience<00:02:26.830> for

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
really really spiritual experience for

really really spiritual experience for
people<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.790> could<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.570> that's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
people you could get to that so that's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.840 
people you could get to that so that's
when<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.170> get<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.380> flow<00:02:29.710> but<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.280> mean<00:02:30.670> so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
when you get the flow but that I mean so

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.100 
when you get the flow but that I mean so
that's<00:02:31.030> definitely<00:02:31.180> when<00:02:31.570> you're<00:02:31.690> you're

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that's definitely when you're you're

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.260 
that's definitely when you're you're
going<00:02:32.320> through<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.560> certain<00:02:32.860> course<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.430> nonstop

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
going through a certain course a nonstop

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.000 
going through a certain course a nonstop
I<00:02:34.450> guess<00:02:34.630> okay<00:02:35.140> having<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> bunch<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.770> obstacles

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
I guess okay having a bunch of obstacles

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.790 
I guess okay having a bunch of obstacles
and<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.610> think<00:02:36.820> it's<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.390> fluid<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.230> you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
and you think it's just so fluid and you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.500 
and you think it's just so fluid and you
just<00:02:39.220> totally<00:02:39.580> immersing<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> experience

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
just totally immersing the experience

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.820 
just totally immersing the experience
nothing<00:02:40.780> else<00:02:40.930> matters<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.380> hurt<00:02:41.740> yourself

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
nothing else matters you hurt yourself

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.240 
nothing else matters you hurt yourself
or<00:02:45.600> there<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:46.750> things<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.530> mean<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.100> look

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
or there are things that I mean you look

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.500 
or there are things that I mean you look
at<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.430> again<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.970> looks<00:02:49.120> very<00:02:49.180> dangerous

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
at that again it looks very dangerous

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.270 
at that again it looks very dangerous
and<00:02:49.870> everything<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.920> think<00:02:51.130> that's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
and everything and I think that's

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.610 
and everything and I think that's
actually<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.090> odds<00:02:52.690> they<00:02:53.260> wanted<00:02:53.530> to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
actually one of the odds they wanted to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.640 
actually one of the odds they wanted to
distractions<00:02:54.610> from<00:02:55.030> or<00:02:55.420> detractions<00:02:56.290> from

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
distractions from or detractions from

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.320 
distractions from or detractions from
all<00:02:56.950> these<00:02:57.100> videos<00:02:57.430> they're<00:02:57.610> being<00:02:57.820> posted<00:02:58.180> up

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
all these videos they're being posted up

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330 
all these videos they're being posted up
online<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.650> lot<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.890> people<00:03:00.130> when<00:03:00.310> I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
online is that a lot of people when I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.400 
online is that a lot of people when I
see<00:03:00.670> it<00:03:00.760> they<00:03:00.850> say<00:03:01.000> oh<00:03:01.180> wow<00:03:01.600> that's<00:03:01.780> amazing

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
see it they say oh wow that's amazing

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.250 
see it they say oh wow that's amazing
but<00:03:02.680> that's<00:03:03.370> not<00:03:03.520> for<00:03:03.700> me<00:03:03.730> which<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> which

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
but that's not for me which is the which

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.810 
but that's not for me which is the which
is<00:03:05.290> how<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.530> felt<00:03:05.920> when<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.520> know<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.640> never

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
is how I felt when you know I never

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.610 
is how I felt when you know I never
entertained<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.660> idea<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.990> doing<00:03:08.230> parkour

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
entertained the idea of doing parkour

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.550 
entertained the idea of doing parkour
until<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.400> was<00:03:10.030> accidentally<00:03:10.690> introduced<00:03:11.260> into

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
until I was accidentally introduced into

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.030 
until I was accidentally introduced into
it<00:03:11.680> right<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:14.020> also<00:03:14.230> requires<00:03:14.709> training

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
it right so it also requires training

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.590 
it right so it also requires training
because<00:03:15.430> these<00:03:15.880> are<00:03:16.120> moves<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.510> you

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
because these are moves that you

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.510 
because these are moves that you
shouldn't<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> spur<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.459> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
shouldn't do just on the spur of the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.010 
shouldn't do just on the spur of the
moment<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.880> can<00:03:19.150> actually<00:03:19.360> hurt<00:03:19.660> yourself

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
moment you can actually hurt yourself

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.060 
moment you can actually hurt yourself
quite<00:03:20.230> badly<00:03:20.440> if<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.680> don't<00:03:20.830> do<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:20.980> correctly

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
quite badly if you don't do it correctly

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.670 
quite badly if you don't do it correctly
right<00:03:21.490> absolutely<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.900> correct<00:03:23.290> way<00:03:23.500> of

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
right absolutely and the correct way of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.650 
right absolutely and the correct way of
training<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.880> must<00:03:25.150> condition<00:03:25.540> your

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
training is that you must condition your

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.449 
training is that you must condition your
body<00:03:25.750> first<00:03:26.110> how<00:03:26.560> long<00:03:26.709> does<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:26.950> take<00:03:27.250> for

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
body first how long does it take for

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.890 
body first how long does it take for
example<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:28.060> sort<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.269> training<00:03:28.600> are<00:03:28.840> we

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
example what sort of training are we

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.490 
example what sort of training are we
talking<00:03:29.290> about

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
talking about

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.229 
talking about
okay<00:03:29.800> well<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.130> there's<00:03:30.580> I'd<00:03:30.850> say<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.150> it's

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
okay well it there's I'd say that it's

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.970 
okay well it there's I'd say that it's
like<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.600> two<00:03:31.810> two<00:03:32.410> components<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
like the two two components of the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.590 
like the two two components of the
training<00:03:33.280> firstly<00:03:33.760> there's<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.970> strength<00:03:34.420> and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
training firstly there's a strength and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.100 
training firstly there's a strength and
conditioning

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
conditioning

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.340 
conditioning
so<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.310> yeah<00:03:36.459> mikaze<00:03:36.970> who<00:03:37.180> started<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.720> many

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
so the yeah mikaze who started this many

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.070 
so the yeah mikaze who started this many
years<00:03:38.590> ago<00:03:38.709> where<00:03:39.640> David<00:03:40.030> Bell<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.750> being

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
years ago where David Bell just being

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.520 
years ago where David Bell just being
the<00:03:41.200> father<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:42.450> they<00:03:43.450> they<00:03:44.350> basically

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
the father of it they they basically

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.920 
the father of it they they basically
spend<00:03:45.519> about<00:03:45.670> two<00:03:45.910> or<00:03:46.000> three<00:03:46.030> hours<00:03:46.600> each

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
spend about two or three hours each

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.780 
spend about two or three hours each
training<00:03:47.440> session<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.280> conditioning

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
training session just on conditioning

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.640 
training session just on conditioning
which<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.360> about<00:03:49.570> building<00:03:49.810> up<00:03:50.050> your<00:03:50.200> strength

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
which is about building up your strength

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.790 
which is about building up your strength
building<00:03:51.519> up<00:03:51.640> your<00:03:51.820> tendons<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:53.350> strengthen

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
building up your tendons to strengthen

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.890 
building up your tendons to strengthen
tendons<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.250> your<00:03:54.280> ligaments<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:55.360> you<00:03:55.420> really

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
tendons in your ligaments so you really

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.449 
tendons in your ligaments so you really
need<00:03:56.050> to<00:03:56.200> have<00:03:56.350> total<00:03:57.130> body<00:03:57.250> conditioning

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
need to have total body conditioning

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.940 
need to have total body conditioning
before<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.690> start<00:03:58.959> attempting<00:03:59.410> really<00:03:59.709> big

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
before you start attempting really big

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.920 
before you start attempting really big
jumps<00:04:00.370> or<00:04:00.610> anything<00:04:01.239> that<00:04:01.330> requires<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.870> you

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
jumps or anything that requires that you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.390 
jumps or anything that requires that you
know<00:04:02.110> it's<00:04:02.230> very<00:04:02.290> demanding<00:04:02.739> discipline<00:04:03.280> so

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
know it's very demanding discipline so

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.130 
know it's very demanding discipline so
you<00:04:03.519> need<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.970> do<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.269> mm-hmm

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
you need to do that mm-hmm

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.470 
you need to do that mm-hmm
and<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.860> also<00:04:06.040> minimizes<00:04:06.700> injuries<00:04:07.180> because

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
and that also minimizes injuries because

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.090 
and that also minimizes injuries because
if<00:04:07.570> your<00:04:07.690> body's<00:04:07.930> not<00:04:08.080> ready<00:04:08.290> for<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.769> you

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
if your body's not ready for it and you

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.860 
if your body's not ready for it and you
try<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.430> do<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.550> really<00:04:09.940> big<00:04:10.030> movement<00:04:10.720> then

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
try and do a really big movement then

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.390 
try and do a really big movement then
obviously<00:04:11.290> you're<00:04:11.380> gonna<00:04:11.500> hurt<00:04:11.980> yourself

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
obviously you're gonna hurt yourself

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.490 
obviously you're gonna hurt yourself
yeah<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:13.360> remind<00:04:13.780> people<00:04:13.810> do<00:04:14.140> they<00:04:14.290> when<00:04:14.410> they

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
yeah and remind people do they when they

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.289 
yeah and remind people do they when they
see<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.800> clips<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.160> mean<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.910> guys<00:04:16.090> have

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
see the clips I mean the guys have

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.300 
see the clips I mean the guys have
practiced<00:04:16.840> through<00:04:17.049> those<00:04:17.260> are<00:04:17.470> exactly<00:04:18.040> runs

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
practiced through those are exactly runs

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.310 
practiced through those are exactly runs
that<00:04:18.580> many<00:04:18.790> times<00:04:19.120> it's<00:04:19.330> not<00:04:19.419> no<00:04:19.720> one<00:04:19.959> else<00:04:20.140> you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
that many times it's not no one else you

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.099 
that many times it's not no one else you
know

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
know

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.600 
know
and<00:04:21.409> there's<00:04:21.590> probably<00:04:21.739> they<00:04:22.129> took<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.430> lot<00:04:22.550> of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
and there's probably they took a lot of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.010 
and there's probably they took a lot of
tax<00:04:27.370> how<00:04:28.370> much<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.699> it<00:04:28.819> is<00:04:28.849> strength<00:04:29.629> and<00:04:29.810> quiet

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
tax how much of it is strength and quiet

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.990 
tax how much of it is strength and quiet
and<00:04:30.289> how<00:04:30.409> much<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.949> just<00:04:30.979> I<00:04:31.400> mean<00:04:31.729> so<00:04:31.879> the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
and how much of it is just I mean so the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.719 
and how much of it is just I mean so the
stronger<00:04:32.449> guys<00:04:32.599> fare<00:04:33.020> better<00:04:33.259> all<00:04:33.620> right<00:04:34.219> okay

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
stronger guys fare better all right okay

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.520 
stronger guys fare better all right okay
strengthen<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.270> think<00:04:35.509> obviously<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.229> do<00:04:36.379> need

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
strengthen I think obviously you do need

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.570 
strengthen I think obviously you do need
to<00:04:36.590> be<00:04:36.680> strong<00:04:37.009> but<00:04:37.189> it's<00:04:37.310> more<00:04:37.460> about

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
to be strong but it's more about

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.429 
to be strong but it's more about
coordination<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.479> engaging<00:04:38.960> your<00:04:39.229> whole

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 
coordination and engaging your whole

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.010 
coordination and engaging your whole
body<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.460> functional<00:04:40.969> movement<00:04:41.419> because<00:04:41.900> if

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
body in a functional movement because if

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.749 
body in a functional movement because if
you<00:04:42.110> take<00:04:42.259> a<00:04:42.319> gym<00:04:42.620> person<00:04:43.370> who<00:04:43.430> goes<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.669> the

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
you take a gym person who goes to the

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.300 
you take a gym person who goes to the
gym<00:04:43.879> for<00:04:44.090> example<00:04:44.770> they're<00:04:45.770> they're<00:04:46.280> just

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
gym for example they're they're just

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.550 
gym for example they're they're just
training<00:04:46.819> on<00:04:46.909> using<00:04:47.270> muscles<00:04:47.900> individually

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
training on using muscles individually

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.080 
training on using muscles individually
you<00:04:48.680> know<00:04:48.800> what<00:04:49.009> kind<00:04:49.219> of<00:04:49.250> biceps<00:04:49.669> working<00:04:49.879> on

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
you know what kind of biceps working on

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.260 
you know what kind of biceps working on
the<00:04:50.150> triceps<00:04:50.569> so<00:04:51.110> they're<00:04:51.409> maybe<00:04:51.620> not<00:04:51.919> as

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
the triceps so they're maybe not as

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.420 
the triceps so they're maybe not as
adapt<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.689> using<00:04:54.319> the<00:04:54.409> whole<00:04:54.590> body<00:04:54.620> as<00:04:55.009> one

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
adapt to using the whole body as one

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.029 
adapt to using the whole body as one
right<00:04:55.939> which<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.389> what<00:04:56.650> parkour<00:04:57.650> allows<00:04:57.889> you

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
right which is what parkour allows you

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.399 
right which is what parkour allows you
to<00:04:58.129> do<00:04:58.279> do<00:04:58.759> you<00:04:58.879> fine<00:04:59.180> I'm<00:04:59.629> sure<00:04:59.689> a<00:04:59.900> lot<00:05:00.289> of
