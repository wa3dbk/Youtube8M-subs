 in the community the jaralillo in the 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.759
 municipality of san felipe in the state of 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 Guanajuato right now let's see the mistress in 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.640
 the in google in plane as the location 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.080
 of this this ranch that is that if you 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.239
 they set this whole journey that we have 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.040
 past this app ready and prepared to 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.400
 the growing area can also be 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.870
 use for the livestock area nothing 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.510
 more this is what I have just shown you 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.399
 and I'll have some videos 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.379
 wider and also in this area you see 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.699
 some houses where also a zone of 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.910
 construction where we will also see 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.270
 a little more in the inside we're going to 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 keep moving forward 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.290
 we are already inside what we saw 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.710
 in the constructions that you see in the 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.510
 previous video in this case the current 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.800
 owner is using this to 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.420
 for roosters and there are three constructions of 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.170
 this side the one we just saw is a 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.300
 construction is enabled as home 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 for services and compar service area 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.070
 and on this side we have a small 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.860
 construction also where it also 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.120
 can use as another living area 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.760
 but in this case it is being used 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.640
 right now for some sheep that have 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:39.040
 there at the moment and give him service of d 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.960
 of food should be clarified that all this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.430
 this ranch is enabled with water in 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.610
 a moment let's go let's see the well and 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.590
 also that it is clear that you are 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.660
 constructions are not 100% finished 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.770
 and they are sold as is this house that 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.720
 we are seeing is where you are 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.720
 would dictate as they are or residential 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.530
 Here I will show you part of the interior 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.970
 of what the house is the area where it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.049
 will use as house that is the plant 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.479
 high of what you saw in the video 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.100
 previous I reiterate is an area is a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.660
 construction that is not 100% 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.560
 determined is missing some windows 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.440
 they lack some civility 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.730
 habilitations and finishes in bathrooms 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.680
 et cetera but this is what can be 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.959
 use here are bedrooms and nothing else 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.819
 to give you a reference this is what 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.730
 that could be used I reiterate them as 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.980
 bedrooms to see the size of what 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.980
 what can be used and enabled 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.150
 and from the window that we saw in the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.980
 previous room we have this view 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.020
 that I take to show you what it is 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.880
 the lagoon that is in then this 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.580
 it means that besides having your own 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.110
 well one of the lagoons the biggest is 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.090
 is where there is even something 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.100
 of fauna 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.100
 of very beautiful bird fauna 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.510
 ok let's see a little more about the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.280
 surface of this property we are 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.430
 standing here opposite in what are the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.920
 constructions and you could see this area 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.340
 of what he called cultivation and here 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.440
 we have this part where it is in a 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.970
 cockfighting area currently 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.129
 as the owner told them 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.250
 used for that purpose and this side 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.230
 let's show a little more of 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.700
 space of the 40 hectares that data does not 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.340
 he had commented to them although he comes in 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.989
 the description are 40 hectares and this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.640
 space also that is here is also 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.819
 important to mention that despite 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.400
 that you see that it looks like it's not 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.739
 worked is also part of the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 same ranch of the jaralillo something of the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.840
 vegetation that is also important that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.579
 can be seen and other data of the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.480
 important that you can see is that it is 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.360
 a totally flat surface 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.430
 enjoys very very good storms has 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.620
 very good weather in addition to everything that they are 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.170
 the wells 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.430
 and the lagoon that just saw everything 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.099
 this space that is being viewed here 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.510
 to this area where all these are 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.209
 curtains of trees is is being 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.640
 the limit take advantage of that has good 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.299
 services as they are water as they are like 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.610
 they are light in and above all also the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.900
 temporary location the weather and all this 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.480
 surface that we are seeing in this 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.609
 travel is part of this same terrain 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.889
 there are the constructions and we are going to 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.889
 see what more more more videos right away 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.690
 and finally I'm going to show you this 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.880
 last video 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.070
 where I wanted to see this part of here is 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.230
 the limit of the terrain 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.439
 all this strip of trees implies 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.849
 also what's inside can happen here 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:42.529
 already after please we mentioned them 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.479
 where the east start 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.429
 the water sprouts that come out 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.939
 lagoon here in this part of this area 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:51.319
 there is the well and here the 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:53.779
 constructions that is where the house is 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.849
 of service that made them mention and the 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.099
 rest of the cooking that you see 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.139
 more for this side is what we had 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.039
 seen earlier in previous videos 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.039
 let's see the entry 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.270
 this is the way to enter this the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.469
 road that comes from silao is a 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.240
 Two lane road with a 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.149
 Boundary is a very comfortable road 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.610
 and to this side we are not turning is 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:18.559
 where where is this whole valley that 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.849
 You see those mountains here to San 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.439
 felipe there is the sign that is the 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.779
 jaralillo and for this entry and 4 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.029
 kilometers towards this side is towards 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.860
 where we have access and we get to 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.219
 ranch that I just mentioned to you the 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.219
 jaralillo 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.940
 and now finally I will be 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.350
 showing the location of the ranch the 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.630
 Jaralillo here you can see the 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.430
 sign and here you see the road that goes 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.310
 of san felipe that is in this area 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.229
 towards silao which is as reference of the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.840
 stronger municipality besides that is 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.669
 very close to lion guanajuato to read from 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.280
 the big city of León Guanajuato and 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.100
 from the same municipality of Guanajuato is 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.650
 around here the airport finally are 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.569
 silao that are 50 kilometers is the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.419
 jaralillo 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.580
 asia good 4 are approximately 40 km and 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.289
 towards san felipe which is the head 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.889
 municipal closest to the urban area 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.300
 They are 7 to 8 km apart 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.639
 practically very close then 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.289
 coming from this highway of irapuato 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.639
 towards the lion in silao it goes to the 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.639
 road that goes towards 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.280
 if the San Luis Potosi is covered, 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.780
 it goes through this part of the sierra and 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.790
 here is the path that made them 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.950
 mention in the previous video that is the 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.900
 of this road 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.760
 this road that is here the ranch 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.440
 is on this side here you can see 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.870
 let's zoom in too if I want to do 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.750
 mention that the recording I made in the 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.420
 path is this here at this point that if 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.220
 they set the path to a curvita 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.200
 towards this side but immediately we 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.380
 we integrate to the four kilometers that 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.130
 they come in the sign they just saw 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.630
 in the in the in the location of the video 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.280
 that you see that you see on the road 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.870
 these are the four kilometers that 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.760
 we are traveling and on the ranch 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.470
 start at this point 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.060
 at this point start the ranch here 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.650
 is the lagoon that I'm going to expand me a 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.940
 little bit more so that the 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.680
 ranch here we are already inside 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.970
 at this point the essence mention and 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.580
 I also mention them who knew a 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.730
 path that was to that path I know it was 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.110
 as the limit is this here is here 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.760
 where the water gushes out here is the 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.110
 lagoon here are the constructions what 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.330
 which is the house and the three houses that 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.370
 he said we came from this side and here 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.740
 is the other recording where is it in 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.720
 the circle where the little noise of 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.190
 the cockfight that made them mention 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.590
 which has the current owner we go by 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.120
 all this part of here and all this is 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.320
 the limit that the curtain of 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.640
 trees this is what you do not see 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.770
 worked this what had been 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.780
 cultivated and from the other strip of 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.200
 trees where it looks 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.520
 this is the limit of all 40 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.010
 hectares next to what is the 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.419
