00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
to this and went to the one of me really

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.650 
to this and went to the one of me really
does<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:51.160> went<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.400> back<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.819> dive<00:03:52.030> van<00:03:52.360> and

looked at our pictures and video I like

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.800 
looked at our pictures and video I like
to<00:03:54.130> call<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.400> base<00:03:54.610> camp<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.209> mean<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.600> think<00:03:55.690> we

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
to call it base camp I mean I think we

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.210 
to call it base camp I mean I think we
had<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:55.959> pretty<00:03:56.170> good<00:03:56.260> idea<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.040> beach

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
had a pretty good idea on the beach

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.920 
had a pretty good idea on the beach
certainly<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:58.000> terms<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.420> underwater

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
certainly in terms of underwater

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.140 
certainly in terms of underwater
performance<00:03:59.650> it's<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.430> most<00:04:00.670> expensive<00:04:00.880> when

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
performance it's the most expensive when

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.120 
performance it's the most expensive when
you<00:04:01.239> get<00:04:01.360> what<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.540> pay<00:04:01.720> for<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.799> this<00:04:02.950> is

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
you get what you pay for but this is

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.819 
you get what you pay for but this is
really<00:04:03.400> designed<00:04:03.670> for<00:04:04.200> divers<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.620> feel

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
really designed for divers and I feel

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:06.780 
really designed for divers and I feel
like<00:04:05.950> if<00:04:06.070> you're<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> diver

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
like if you're a diver

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.100 
like if you're a diver
there's<00:04:07.150> devices<00:04:07.600> but<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.780> don't<00:04:07.930> know<00:04:07.989> why

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
there's devices but I don't know why

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.420 
there's devices but I don't know why
you'd<00:04:08.290> want<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.500> bring<00:04:08.680> your<00:04:08.829> iPhone<00:04:09.310> in

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
you'd want to bring your iPhone in

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.770 
you'd want to bring your iPhone in
before<00:04:09.640> your<00:04:09.760> iPhone<00:04:10.030> into<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.239> diving<00:04:10.450> well<00:04:10.750> I

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
before your iPhone into a diving well I

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.400 
before your iPhone into a diving well I
will<00:04:11.110> say<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.350> even

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
will say that even

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.560 
will say that even
Buie<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:13.010> got<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.460> text<00:04:13.790> while<00:04:14.090> those<00:04:14.240> underwater

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
Buie I got a text while those underwater

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.570 
Buie I got a text while those underwater
it<00:04:14.960> was<00:04:15.110> kind<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.380> awesome<00:04:15.740> you<00:04:16.070> could<00:04:16.220> respond

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
it was kind of awesome you could respond

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.040 
it was kind of awesome you could respond
to<00:04:16.730> it<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.090> know<00:04:17.209> that's<00:04:17.420> true<00:04:17.600> because<00:04:17.840> I

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
to it I know that's true because I

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.479 
to it I know that's true because I
couldn't<00:04:18.320> make<00:04:18.380> any<00:04:18.560> buttons<00:04:18.890> work<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.400> the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
couldn't make any buttons work so the

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.340 
couldn't make any buttons work so the
biggest<00:04:19.670> bummer<00:04:20.090> for<00:04:20.120> me<00:04:20.390> about<00:04:20.840> both<00:04:21.140> the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
biggest bummer for me about both the

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.960 
biggest bummer for me about both the
beach<00:04:21.500> boy<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.310> hit<00:04:22.460> taste

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
beach boy and the hit taste

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.640 
beach boy and the hit taste
maybe<00:04:23.270> it's<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.630> salt<00:04:23.870> water<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:24.440> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
maybe it's the salt water is the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.020 
maybe it's the salt water is the
conduction<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.700> touch<00:04:25.880> interface

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
conduction of the touch interface

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.820 
conduction of the touch interface
because<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.540> works<00:04:26.690> fine<00:04:26.840> above<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:27.740> it

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
because it works fine above but it

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.050 
because it works fine above but it
didn't<00:04:28.040> work<00:04:28.070> underwater<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.880> was<00:04:29.030> just

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
didn't work underwater so I was just

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.000 
didn't work underwater so I was just
kind<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.420> letdown<00:04:29.630> overall<00:04:30.230> yeah<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.890> think

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
kind of a letdown overall yeah I think

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.470 
kind of a letdown overall yeah I think
the<00:04:31.220> beach<00:04:31.370> buoy<00:04:31.580> is<00:04:31.760> great<00:04:32.030> if<00:04:32.210> you're<00:04:32.330> just

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
the beach buoy is great if you're just

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.610 
the beach buoy is great if you're just
looking<00:04:32.720> for<00:04:32.750> something<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.230> protect<00:04:33.410> your

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
phone in case you accidentally pop it in

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.610 
phone in case you accidentally pop it in
the<00:04:35.150> water<00:04:35.330> you're<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.840> boat<00:04:36.050> somewhere<00:04:36.380> or

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
the water you're on a boat somewhere or

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.620 
the water you're on a boat somewhere or
whatever<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.370> as<00:04:37.550> far<00:04:37.850> as<00:04:38.030> like<00:04:38.270> taking

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
whatever but as far as like taking

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.720 
whatever but as far as like taking
pictures<00:04:39.020> underwater<00:04:39.320> yeah<00:04:39.920> it's<00:04:40.460> not<00:04:40.580> gonna

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
pictures underwater yeah it's not gonna

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.060 
pictures underwater yeah it's not gonna
do<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.000> job<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.540> case<00:04:41.810> video<00:04:42.170> quality<00:04:42.620> since

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
do the job it case video quality since

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.460 
do the job it case video quality since
that's<00:04:43.250> all<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.430> could<00:04:43.670> take<00:04:43.880> was<00:04:44.360> pretty<00:04:45.020> good

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
that's all I could take was pretty good

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.810 
that's all I could take was pretty good
and<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.830> head<00:04:45.980> case<00:04:46.130> has<00:04:46.310> something<00:04:46.610> going

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
and the head case has something going

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.160 
and the head case has something going
for<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.000> which<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.240> it's<00:04:47.480> an<00:04:47.600> all-around

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
for it which is that it's an all-around

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.410 
for it which is that it's an all-around
tough<00:04:48.890> case<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:49.430> if<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.670> use<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.090> any

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
tough case so if you use it for any

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.720 
tough case so if you use it for any
adventure<00:04:50.870> he's<00:04:51.590> got<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> cool<00:04:52.070> wide-angle

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
adventure he's got a cool wide-angle

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.370 
adventure he's got a cool wide-angle
lens<00:04:52.910> on<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.240> back<00:04:53.420> and<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:54.020> can<00:04:54.170> take<00:04:54.290> it

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
lens on the back and you can take it

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.020 
lens on the back and you can take it
underwater<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.280> there's<00:04:55.460> a<00:04:55.520> lot<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:55.880> recommend

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
underwater so there's a lot to recommend

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:04.270 
underwater so there's a lot to recommend
this<00:04:56.360> at<00:04:56.510> 90<00:04:56.780> bucks

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.040 

if<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.370> really<00:05:05.760> had<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.120> choose<00:05:06.390> between<00:05:06.630> one<00:05:07.020> of

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
if I really had to choose between one of

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.390 
if I really had to choose between one of
these<00:05:07.200> three<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.830> one<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.010> think<00:05:08.160> you're

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
these three and the one I think you're

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.380 
these three and the one I think you're
most<00:05:08.490> likely<00:05:08.730> to<00:05:08.880> buy<00:05:10.160> reach<00:05:11.160> buoy<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.880> think

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
most likely to buy reach buoy I think

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.580 
most likely to buy reach buoy I think
for<00:05:12.510> most<00:05:12.600> people<00:05:12.900> who<00:05:12.960> are<00:05:12.990> just<00:05:13.290> gonna<00:05:13.440> use

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
for most people who are just gonna use

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.750 
for most people who are just gonna use
it<00:05:13.710> wants<00:05:13.890> to<00:05:13.980> really<00:05:14.370> want<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.580> take<00:05:14.730> that

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
thing in the water
