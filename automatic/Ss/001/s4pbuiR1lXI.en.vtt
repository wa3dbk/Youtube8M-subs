00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.210
 Hi, I'm Michael Hampden, Lead Game Designer on Assassin's Creed Rogue. 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.230
 offer a new perspective on the Assassin's Creed experience by playing Shay, a Templar, 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 in search of extermination of the Brotherhood of Assassins. And here we are. 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.199
 Joining the ranks of the Knights Templar will give you access to brand new types of weapons and 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.070
 technologies. 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.590
 On land, you can use Shay's air rifle, a powerful weapon that will be your 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 best ally in many situations. Do you want to play it undercover? The soporific darts 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.710
 will put the enemy to sleep while the furious darts will be extremely useful 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.440
 to avoid engaging in major fights. And not only about humans! 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 When facing a group of enemies, you can also use grenades with your airgun. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.330
 Sow chaos in the enemy ranks using devastating fragmentation grenades. Or put them to sleep with soporific gas. But do not 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.239
 do not worry, you will have a gas mask ... 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.429
 You will find the weapon corresponding to your style in the vast arsenal of Templars. But keep, 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.119
 always an eye open because the Assassins will hunt you down. 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.740
 The many technological advances of the Knights Templar also apply to naval battles. Shay's ship, 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.210
 the Morrigan, is one of the fastest and most devastating of its time. Use the turret 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.479
 (a kind of primitive machine gun) to inflict significant damage 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.170
 to enemy ships when you are close range.You can also throw burning oil barrels behind you 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.369
 to trap the ships chasing you. 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.179
 You will need a ship equipped and armed enough to take part in the fighting 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.450
 legendary games that will take place in the gaming world. 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.270
 And just like on earth, the Assassins will go after you on the sea. If they get too close to you 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.020
 they will approach you. So be prepared to defend the Morrigan, whatever the price.
