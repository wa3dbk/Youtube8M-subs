 Hi, this is Nathan Dayton and I will tell you a bit about PlayStation®Plus on PlayStation®4 today. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.200
 There has been a lot of good news about the PlayStation®4 since the E3 conference. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
 That's how she looks. 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
 That's how much it will cost. 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.800
 She will. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 But after all this jubilation, there was reason for even more cheers. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.500
 It has been announced that existing PlayStation®Plus memberships will be transferred to the PlayStation®4. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
 If you do not know what PlayStation®Plus is ... well, it's great. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 A subscription service by the PS3 and PS Vita owners with ... 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 ... special offers, early beta access, online storage and automatic patch downloads. 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.300
 But the best part is the access to the incredible collection of games. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.700
 Through them you get access to at least ten highly rated games at no extra cost. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Transferring Plus membership to PlayStation®4 is big news. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.700
 It means that PlayStation®4 users will get even more games for the same price. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.500
 The launch will be a PS Plus edition of DRIVECLUB and a digital title yet to be announced. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.900
 It has been confirmed that all social media features of the game will be available in this release of DRIVECLUB. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 It was also confirmed that the digital title will be exchanged monthly to ensure a regular supply of new games. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.600
 Another important feature of PS Plus on PS4 is that you have to be a member to play online multiplayer games. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.900
 This is because Sony is investing heavily in PSN to make all the new online features of the PS4 possible. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.900
 There are also many features that you do not need to be a member of. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.400
 Such as cross-game chat, Netflix and other video services, ... 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.500
 ... automatic system software downloads or some free-to-play online games, ... 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.200
 ... like DC Universe Online or the fantastic Planetside 2. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.200
 Plus, if you look at the many benefits of PS Plus on PS Vita, PS3 and now also PS4, ... 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.600
 ... it would be madness not to become a member anyway. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.500
 For more PlayStation®4 videos, you should now subscribe to the PlayStation YouTube channel.
