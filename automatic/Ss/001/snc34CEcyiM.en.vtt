first<00:02:12.520> six<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.970> should<00:02:13.240> be<00:02:13.330> saying<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.630> first

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
first six I should be saying the first

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.850 
first six I should be saying the first
four<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.910> best<00:02:16.090> race<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> world
