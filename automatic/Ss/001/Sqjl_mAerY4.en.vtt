00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
slightly wider than shoulder width apart

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.190 
slightly wider than shoulder width apart
it's<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> start<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:12.990> feet

like they do in ballet they call it a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.380

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and then on the balls of the feet you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.990 
and then on the balls of the feet you
come<00:01:23.580> back<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.770> slightly<00:01:26.520> wider

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
come back and that is slightly wider

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.410 
come back and that is slightly wider
than<00:01:27.299> shoulder<00:01:27.960> width<00:01:28.110> apart<00:01:29.030> then<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.299> they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
than shoulder width apart then when they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.140 
than shoulder width apart then when they
say<00:01:30.630> double<00:01:31.079> shoulder<00:01:31.439> width<00:01:31.590> apart<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
say double shoulder width apart you do a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.260 
say double shoulder width apart you do a
similar<00:01:33.840> thing<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.829> way<00:01:35.220> out<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
similar thing like this way out at the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.560 
similar thing like this way out at the
heels<00:01:36.659> first<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.100> repeat

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
heels first and then you just repeat

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.920 
heels first and then you just repeat
this<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> big

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this in this and now that's like the big

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.679 
this in this and now that's like the big
horse<00:01:43.500> stance<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.640> would<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> widest

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
horse stance that would be the widest

horse stance that would be the widest
you<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:45.960> ever<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:47.040> only<00:01:47.250> used<00:01:47.640> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
martial cultivation you don't really

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
martial cultivation you don't really
want<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:51.810> main<00:01:51.990> practice<00:01:52.320> so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's for the main practice you'll either
choose<00:01:55.159> one<00:01:56.159> foot<00:01:56.460> length<00:01:56.670> apart<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:58.189> slightly

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
choose one foot length apart or slightly

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.389 
choose one foot length apart or slightly
wider<00:01:59.490> than<00:01:59.670> shoulder<00:02:00.060> width<00:02:00.570> apart<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.399> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
wider than shoulder width apart and this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
wider than shoulder width apart and this
is<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> stance<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.270> prefer<00:02:03.689> when<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
is the stance that I prefer when you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.029 
is the stance that I prefer when you
squat<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:05.030> into<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> stance<00:02:06.509> you're<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
squat down into the stance you're you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.070 
squat down into the stance you're you
just<00:02:08.250> sit<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> let<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.450> knees<00:02:09.479> come

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
just sit down and let your knees come

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.140 
just sit down and let your knees come
together<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.580> unwind<00:02:11.879> them<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
together and then unwind them and that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.589 
together and then unwind them and that
creates<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.780> torque<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.489> ankle<00:02:16.060> tendons

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
creates a torque on the ankle tendons

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.569 
creates a torque on the ankle tendons
and<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> kind<00:02:17.079> of<00:02:17.140> runs<00:02:17.379> up<00:02:17.650> into<00:02:18.069> your<00:02:18.220> hips

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
and it kind of runs up into your hips

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.580 
and it kind of runs up into your hips
and<00:02:19.000> then<00:02:19.540> it's<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.110> you're<00:02:20.290> sitting

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
and then it's just like you're sitting

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.229 
and then it's just like you're sitting
in<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.920> chair<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:22.030> weight<00:02:22.299> should<00:02:22.569> feel<00:02:24.239> like

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
in a chair your weight should feel like

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.000 
in a chair your weight should feel like
in<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.540> center<00:02:25.989> of<00:02:26.019> your<00:02:26.290> foot<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.769> in<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
in the center of your foot like in the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.250 
in the center of your foot like in the
sole<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.430> your<00:02:27.459> foot<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.970> then<00:02:28.260> slightly
