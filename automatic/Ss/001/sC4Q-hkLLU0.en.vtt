00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 do not 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.170
 that also a welcome hello thank you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.170
 for the interview hello how are you 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.800
 very good with this acoustic medium 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.930
 improvised because this does not 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.550
 they reported very well of some 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 technical issues then we arrived 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.750
 there to do what you can and left 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.089
 came out father the truth is that as a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.390
 little more intimate for the people who came 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.840
 to listen to us and for their discounts had 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 very very father 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.430
 in the auditorium along with the record companies 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.290
 organizers of this event justly 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.660
 to fight piracy that's something 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.870
 a very good initiative that there is of 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.580
 expression, you do not, well, the truth 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.400
 we do depend on the sale of 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.540
 discs so the label does not follow 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.090
 supporting then and beyond 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.360
 moral questions of whether it is okay not 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.250
 is wrong to us simply 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.040
 we depend on that then if they like it 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.530

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.470
 us whether the digital or purchased 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.830
