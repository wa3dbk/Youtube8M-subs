00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the s4 just a small little upgrade but I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
the s4 just a small little upgrade but I
will<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.100> later<00:01:02.280> flip<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> over<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
will get to that later flip it over the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
will get to that later flip it over the

two<00:01:16.080> new<00:01:16.229> sensors<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> those<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.970> heart

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
two new sensors and those are a heart

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that's a really weird feature for

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
that's a really weird feature for
samsung<00:01:24.780> add<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.320> heart<00:01:25.740> rate<00:01:25.890> monitor<00:01:25.950> your

samsung add a heart rate monitor your

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
samsung add a heart rate monitor your
own<00:01:26.400> phone<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.630> guess<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
own phone but I guess that's kind of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780 
own phone but I guess that's kind of
cool<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.100> around<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> front<00:01:29.640> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
that summer before the way this
fingerprint<00:01:37.799> scanner<00:01:38.070> works<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.640> place

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
fingerprint scanner works is you place

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
fingerprint scanner works is you place
your<00:01:38.939> thumb<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.689> slide<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
your thumb on it and actually slide it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.020 
your thumb on it and actually slide it
down<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.280> actually<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.850> whole

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
down so we can actually get your whole

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
down so we can actually get your whole
fingerprint<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.750> rather<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.380> an<00:01:43.530> iphone<00:01:43.920> 5s

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

where you just set your fingerprint down
on<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> scans<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.340> actually

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
on it and then it scans you actually

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.219

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.810 
problem I mean straight copying somebody
is<00:04:21.870> one<00:04:22.079> thing<00:04:22.320> but<00:04:22.740> competition<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.550> good

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
is one thing but competition is good

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.339 
is one thing but competition is good
that's<00:04:24.090> going<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.510> make<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.780> phones<00:04:25.020> better

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
that's going to make the phones better

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.730 
that's going to make the phones better
for<00:04:25.650> all<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.860> us<00:04:26.159> I

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
for all of us I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.020 
for all of us I
so<00:04:26.830> don't<00:04:26.979> understand<00:04:27.370> why<00:04:27.490> people<00:04:27.520> think<00:04:27.880> it

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
so don't understand why people think it

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.939 
so don't understand why people think it
has<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.150> be<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.630> or<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.139> other<00:04:29.349> like<00:04:29.770> if

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
has to be one or the other like if

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.860 
has to be one or the other like if

like<00:04:43.210> it's<00:04:43.660> just<00:04:43.780> too<00:04:43.990> slow<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.560> rarely<00:04:45.099> works

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
like it's just too slow I rarely works

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.640 
like it's just too slow I rarely works
