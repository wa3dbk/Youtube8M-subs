way it's nice and tender now this I've
already<00:02:02.399> marinated<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:04.170> needs<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> sit

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
already marinated and this needs to sit

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.969 
already marinated and this needs to sit
out<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> counter<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.860> know

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
out on the counter for a good you know

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.779 
out on the counter for a good you know
20-30<00:02:08.819> minutes<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
20-30 minutes so

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.339 
20-30 minutes so
it<00:02:09.819> comes<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.360> room<00:02:10.539> temperature<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
it comes up to room temperature and the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.080 
it comes up to room temperature and the
reason<00:02:11.680> why<00:02:11.829> you<00:02:11.890> want<00:02:12.219> to<00:02:12.400> do<00:02:12.549> that<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
reason why you want to do that is

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.240 
reason why you want to do that is
because<00:02:13.659> you<00:02:13.780> want<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.200> make<00:02:14.379> sure<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
because you want to make sure that it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.759 
because you want to make sure that it
grills<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.150> cooks<00:02:16.420> evenly<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:17.469> that<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.680> what

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
grills it cooks evenly and that is what

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.619 
grills it cooks evenly and that is what
bringing<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.370> room<00:02:18.549> temperature<00:02:18.579> does<00:02:19.329> and

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
bringing it to room temperature does and

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.890 
bringing it to room temperature does and
then<00:02:20.370> right<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.609> to<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.030> grill<00:02:22.299> now<00:02:22.689> if<00:02:22.780> you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
then right on to the grill now if you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.300 
then right on to the grill now if you
want<00:02:23.109> medium-rare<00:02:23.650> you're<00:02:23.890> going<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.069> have<00:02:24.189> to

want medium-rare you're going to have to

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.619 
want medium-rare you're going to have to
grill<00:02:24.549> this<00:02:24.700> for<00:02:24.909> about<00:02:25.000> six<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.450> eight

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
grill this for about six to eight

grill this for about six to eight
minutes<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:26.079> each<00:02:26.290> side<00:02:26.319> because<00:02:26.859> a<00:02:27.010> flank

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
minutes on each side because a flank

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.339 
minutes on each side because a flank
