00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.770 
into a junior that's just my opinion and
I<00:02:03.819> think<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:06.950> some<00:02:07.399> point<00:02:07.569> from<00:02:08.569> what<00:02:08.750> I

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
I think at some point from what I

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.610 
I think at some point from what I
understand<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.080> third<00:02:12.290> time<00:02:12.590> that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
understand this is the third time that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.770 
understand this is the third time that
he's<00:02:12.860> had<00:02:13.100> difficulty<00:02:13.940> with<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.360> he's<00:02:14.569> been

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
he's had difficulty with this he's been

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.470 
he's had difficulty with this he's been
talking<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.170> long<00:02:15.380> time<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.940> again<00:02:18.190> my<00:02:19.480> my

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
talking a long time so again my my

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.080 
talking a long time so again my my
personal<00:02:20.540> feeling<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.530> he<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> bit<00:02:22.519> away<00:02:22.760> now

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
personal feeling is he is a bit away now

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.390 
personal feeling is he is a bit away now
we<00:02:26.090> saw<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.600> situation<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:29.650> Chad<00:02:30.650> Dawson<00:02:30.920> yeah

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
we saw the situation of Chad Dawson yeah

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.070 
we saw the situation of Chad Dawson yeah
you<00:02:31.459> can<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.299> get<00:02:32.450> him<00:02:32.569> down<00:02:32.750> if<00:02:33.049> that

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
you can you can get him down if that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.370 
you can you can get him down if that
doesn't<00:02:33.560> mean<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.910> supposed<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.450> be<00:02:36.170> down

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
doesn't mean it's supposed to be down

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.900 
doesn't mean it's supposed to be down
there<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.709> think<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:38.260> observing<00:02:39.260> him

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
there I think that observing him

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.150 
there I think that observing him
sparring<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> high<00:02:41.329> 60s<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.260> 70s<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
sparring in the high 60s and the 70s and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.039 
sparring in the high 60s and the 70s and
training<00:02:43.970> camp

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
training camp

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.580 
training camp
I<00:02:45.280> know<00:02:46.280> instinctively<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.350> he<00:02:48.350> probably

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
I know instinctively that he probably

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.339 
I know instinctively that he probably
shouldn't<00:02:49.010> cut<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.400> much<00:02:49.579> away<00:02:49.820> dating

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
shouldn't cut so much away dating

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.440 
shouldn't cut so much away dating
so<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.830> your<00:02:53.069> opinion<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.700> feel<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.239> was

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
so in your opinion you feel if this was

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.309 
so in your opinion you feel if this was
165<00:02:55.260> 60<00:02:56.099> pound<00:02:56.370> fights<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:57.000> night<00:02:57.330> there<00:02:58.170> would

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
165 60 pound fights a night there would

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.920 
165 60 pound fights a night there would
have<00:02:58.379> been<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.530> knock<00:02:58.769> out<00:03:04.370> now<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.720> had

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
have been a knock out now you have had

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.789

something you're willing to take at 154
or<00:04:30.900> do<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.320> feel<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.880> because<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:33.150> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
or do you feel that because of the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.379 
or do you feel that because of the
amateur<00:04:33.720> background<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:34.440> Ellora<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.970> it

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
amateur background of Ellora that it

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.930 
amateur background of Ellora that it
would<00:04:36.660> be<00:04:36.810> as<00:04:36.930> better<00:04:37.259> suited<00:04:37.710> fight<00:04:37.979> at<00:04:38.130> 160

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
would be as better suited fight at 160

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.050 
would be as better suited fight at 160
and<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.150> would<00:04:39.330> steer<00:04:39.660> him<00:04:39.840> away<00:04:39.960> from<00:04:40.320> that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
and you would steer him away from that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.670 
and you would steer him away from that
well<00:04:42.060> large<00:04:42.330> has<00:04:42.630> had<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> fight<00:04:43.139> with<00:04:43.349> Vaughn

as<00:04:44.330> horizon<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.780> don't<00:04:46.080> see<00:04:46.349> where<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.650> would

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
as horizon so I don't see where it would

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.670 
as horizon so I don't see where it would
make<00:04:47.270> good<00:04:48.270> sense<00:04:48.570> with<00:04:48.840> Demetrius<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.530> his

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
no idea you could have been a number of

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.749 
no idea you could have been a number of
factors<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.770> know<00:05:01.830> one<00:05:02.160> thing<00:05:02.370> he<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:02.639> in

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
factors I know one thing he was in

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.370 
factors I know one thing he was in
tip-top<00:05:02.970> shape<00:05:03.240> because<00:05:05.240> Edward<00:05:06.240> Jackson<00:05:06.960> was

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
tip-top shape because Edward Jackson was

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.860 
tip-top shape because Edward Jackson was
also<00:05:07.889> on<00:05:08.070> Andres<00:05:08.550> conditions<00:05:09.240> condition<00:05:09.750> D

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
also on Andres conditions condition D

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.490

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
and there's just some flaws that they

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.270 
and there's just some flaws that they
have<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:16.199> when<00:05:16.560> they<00:05:16.650> get<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.070> highest

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280
