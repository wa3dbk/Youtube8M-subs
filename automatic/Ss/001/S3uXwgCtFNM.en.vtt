00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
um because that's always been just the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.059 
um because that's always been just the
one<00:01:45.810> part<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.080> my<00:01:46.170> nose<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.530> bothered<00:01:46.860> me<00:01:47.039> I

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.510 
the surgery no no no there's too many I
personally<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.039> think<00:01:56.190> there's<00:01:56.310> too<00:01:56.429> many

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
personally I think there's too many

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219 
personally I think there's too many
complications<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.299> go<00:01:57.420> along<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:57.869> surgery

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
complications that go along with surgery

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.160 
complications that go along with surgery
so<00:01:58.709> this<00:01:59.280> one's<00:01:59.489> non-invasive<00:01:59.879> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.050> know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
so this one's non-invasive and you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.199 
so this one's non-invasive and you know
after<00:02:01.349> two<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.979> half<00:02:02.069> or<00:02:02.250> three<00:02:02.280> years<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.940> I

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
after two and a half or three years if I

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:04.940 
after two and a half or three years if I
like<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.840> keep<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.770> don't

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
like it I can keep going and if I don't

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.290 
like it I can keep going and if I don't
like<00:02:05.099> it<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.789> again<00:02:05.940> soon

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
like it I don't have to do it again soon

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.999 
like it I don't have to do it again soon

quick question it's David this is not
only<00:02:25.800> less<00:02:25.980> painful<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.700> lot<00:02:26.879> less

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
only less painful is it a lot less

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.170 
only less painful is it a lot less
expensive<00:02:27.239> than<00:02:27.599> rhinoplasty<00:02:28.349> traditionally

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
expensive than rhinoplasty traditionally

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.280 
expensive than rhinoplasty traditionally
yeah<00:02:30.180> well<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.810> lot<00:02:30.989> less<00:02:31.110> expensive

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
yeah well it's a lot less expensive

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.559 
yeah well it's a lot less expensive
about<00:02:31.920> one-tenth<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.910> cost<00:02:33.180> actually

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
about one-tenth of the cost actually

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.089 
about one-tenth of the cost actually
about<00:02:34.349> $1,000<00:02:35.040> yeah<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.310> $1,000<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.480> it's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800 
yeah it's it's much yeah much easier
procedure<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.250> Jana's<00:02:41.849> connected<00:02:42.300> question

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
procedure and Jana's connected question

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.380 
procedure and Jana's connected question
because<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:44.400> interesting<00:02:44.610> in

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
because you know it's interesting in

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.780 
because you know it's interesting in
terms<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.870> filling<00:02:46.409> out<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.250> part<00:02:47.519> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
terms of filling out the the part that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.149 
terms of filling out the the part that
that<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.959> will<00:02:49.080> give<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.409> nose<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> straighter

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
that it will give the nose a straighter

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.130 
that it will give the nose a straighter
line<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.760> what<00:02:51.239> if<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.480> want<00:02:51.659> to<00:02:51.750> reduce<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
line but what if you want to reduce the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.949 
line but what if you want to reduce the
size<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.920> your<00:02:52.980> nose<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:54.060> obviously<00:02:54.629> doesn't

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
size of your nose that obviously doesn't

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.290 
size of your nose that obviously doesn't
require<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.440> filler<00:02:55.920> how<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.060> non

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
require a filler how do you do that non

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.500 
require a filler how do you do that non
surgically

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.610 

well<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> thing<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.140> mean<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.410> interesting

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
well the thing is I mean the interesting

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.460 
well the thing is I mean the interesting
thing<00:03:04.010> about<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.550> though<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.690> know

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
thing about it is though that the I know

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.960 
thing about it is though that the I know
what<00:03:07.280> makes<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.670> nose<00:03:07.880> look<00:03:08.440> particularly

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
what makes a nose look particularly

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.280 
what makes a nose look particularly
noticeable<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.150> look<00:03:11.330> particularly<00:03:11.660> larger

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
noticeable and look particularly larger

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.080 
noticeable and look particularly larger
as<00:03:12.410> if<00:03:12.530> there<00:03:12.680> isn't<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:13.069> kind<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.550> irregularity

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
as if there isn't a kind of irregularity

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.720 
as if there isn't a kind of irregularity
not<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.470> know<00:03:15.560> not<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.069> say<00:03:16.220> their<00:03:16.340> nose<00:03:16.520> isn't

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
not you know not to say their nose isn't

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.010 
not you know not to say their nose isn't
nice<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.270> just<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:17.690> there's<00:03:17.900> an

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
nice but it's just if there's an

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.800 
nice but it's just if there's an
irregularity<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.920> there's<00:03:19.130> some<00:03:19.810> I

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
irregularity and that there's some I

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.430 
irregularity and that there's some I
understand<00:03:21.739> Jake's<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.280> so<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.360> index<00:03:24.200> yeah

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
understand Jake's it so the index yeah

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.570 
understand Jake's it so the index yeah
the<00:03:24.650> indentation

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
the indentation

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.390 
the indentation
it<00:03:25.819> makes<00:03:26.300> broad<00:03:26.720> draws<00:03:27.470> more<00:03:27.680> attention<00:03:27.739> to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
it makes broad draws more attention to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.160 
it makes broad draws more attention to
the<00:03:28.610> size<00:03:28.880> because<00:03:29.569> it's<00:03:29.870> sort<00:03:30.020> of<00:03:30.080> the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
the size because it's sort of the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.770 
the size because it's sort of the
current<00:03:30.350> fast<00:03:30.770> right<00:03:31.310> correct<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.480> once<00:03:32.630> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
current fast right correct and once you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.150 
current fast right correct and once you
make<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:32.989> straight<00:03:33.350> once<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.709> make<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:34.010> more

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
make it straight once you make it more

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.440 
make it straight once you make it more
in<00:03:34.280> harmony<00:03:34.400> with<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.760> rest<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.060> face<00:03:35.239> it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
in harmony with the rest of the face it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.960

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
this injection actually works we look at

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.820 
this injection actually works we look at
the<00:05:42.000> results<00:05:42.510> which<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:42.750> clear<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.440> see<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.740> the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
the results which is clear to see to the

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.500 
the results which is clear to see to the
eye<00:05:43.860> but<00:05:44.340> what's<00:05:44.580> actually<00:05:44.760> happening<00:05:45.330> inside

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
eye but what's actually happening inside

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.770 
eye but what's actually happening inside
the<00:05:45.810> nose<00:05:45.990> that<00:05:46.350> that<00:05:46.620> works<00:05:46.919> so<00:05:47.130> well<00:05:47.780> well

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
the nose that that works so well well

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.440 
the nose that that works so well well
what<00:05:48.990> happens<00:05:49.350> is<00:05:49.470> when<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:49.650> when<00:05:50.130> I<00:05:50.460> to

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
what happens is when you when I to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.350 
what happens is when you when I to
camouflage<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.289> area<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.360> irregularity

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
camouflage the area the the irregularity

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.390 
camouflage the area the the irregularity
of<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.870> nose<00:05:55.200> I<00:05:55.440> just<00:05:55.650> put<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.919> into<00:05:56.190> very

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
of the nose I just put it into very

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.510 
of the nose I just put it into very
precise<00:05:56.789> very<00:05:57.090> very<00:05:57.900> precise<00:05:58.200> points<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.890> the

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
precise very very precise points and the

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.600 
precise very very precise points and the
injectable<00:06:00.450> goes<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:00.840> it's<00:06:00.960> kind<00:06:01.200> of<00:06:01.260> like<00:06:01.440> a

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
injectable goes and it's kind of like a

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.950 
injectable goes and it's kind of like a
mesh<00:06:02.610> kind<00:06:03.000> of<00:06:03.090> like<00:06:03.210> a<00:06:03.240> scaffolding<00:06:03.930> that

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
mesh kind of like a scaffolding that

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.260 
mesh kind of like a scaffolding that
goes<00:06:04.200> in<00:06:04.440> there<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:05.130> body<00:06:05.580> cells<00:06:05.970> grow

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
goes in there and the body cells grow

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.370 
goes in there and the body cells grow
into<00:06:06.630> it<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.020> so<00:06:07.680> it<00:06:07.890> provides

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
into it and so it provides

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.560 
into it and so it provides
they<00:06:08.710> really<00:06:09.160> anchor<00:06:09.460> it<00:06:09.520> into<00:06:09.670> place<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:10.270> it

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
they really anchor it into place and it

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.890 
they really anchor it into place and it
provides<00:06:10.990> a<00:06:11.350> nice<00:06:12.040> fill<00:06:12.850> in<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.420> specific

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
provides a nice fill in the specific

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.660 
provides a nice fill in the specific
