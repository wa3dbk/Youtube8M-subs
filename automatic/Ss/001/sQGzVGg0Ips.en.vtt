00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
says Trevor on the bottom and the other

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
says Trevor on the bottom and the other
side<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.290> wheel<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.729> let's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
side also has a little wheel so let's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.480 
side also has a little wheel so let's
talk<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.810> his<00:01:46.470> back<00:01:47.280> he<00:01:48.240> has<00:01:48.479> um<00:01:49.369> he<00:01:50.369> has

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
talk about on his back he has um he has

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210 
talk about on his back he has um he has
coal<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> back<00:01:51.439> yeah<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:52.860> that's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
coal in the back yeah I think that's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.569 
coal in the back yeah I think that's
cold

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
cold

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.060 
cold
um<00:01:53.990> because<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.259> also<00:01:55.380> need<00:01:55.680> coal<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
um because they also need coal and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.679 
um because they also need coal and
that's<00:01:56.250> probably<00:01:56.520> where<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> driver<00:01:57.270> says

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that's probably where the driver says

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.340 
that's probably where the driver says
