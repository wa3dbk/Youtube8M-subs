00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
for the longest time these aren't the

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.140 
for the longest time these aren't the
wet<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.690> wild<00:00:17.580> lipsticks<00:00:18.580> and<00:00:18.820> they<00:00:18.910> look

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
wet and wild lipsticks and they look

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.080 
wet and wild lipsticks and they look
like<00:00:19.390> this<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:20.050> if<00:00:21.010> you<00:00:21.220> have<00:00:21.699> tried

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
like this and if you have tried

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.480 
like this and if you have tried
Wet'n'Wild<00:00:23.050> you<00:00:23.380> notice<00:00:23.769> that<00:00:23.920> they're<00:00:24.070> very

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
Wet'n'Wild you notice that they're very

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.300 
Wet'n'Wild you notice that they're very
very<00:00:24.869> inexpensive<00:00:25.869> I<00:00:26.050> believe<00:00:26.679> these<00:00:27.009> are

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
very inexpensive I believe these are

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.939 
very inexpensive I believe these are
maybe<00:00:27.670> less<00:00:28.269> than<00:00:28.300> three<00:00:29.019> dollars<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:29.679> these

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
maybe less than three dollars so these

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.330 
maybe less than three dollars so these
could<00:00:30.220> go<00:00:30.369> up<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.550> like<00:00:30.880> 199<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.990> most<00:00:32.259> or<00:00:32.830> even

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
could go up to like 199 the most or even

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.680 
could go up to like 199 the most or even
two<00:00:33.580> dollars<00:00:33.970> but<00:00:34.300> not<00:00:34.540> more<00:00:34.720> than<00:00:34.780> three<00:00:35.170> so<00:00:35.980> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
two dollars but not more than three so I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.300 
two dollars but not more than three so I
was<00:00:37.690> actually<00:00:37.990> went<00:00:38.650> to<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.890> store<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:41.310> 23

I am trying to do a tutorial and I'm

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.720 
I am trying to do a tutorial and I'm
looking<00:00:56.140> for<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.470> perfect<00:00:56.710> red<00:00:57.040> lipstick<00:00:57.520> and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
looking for the perfect red lipstick and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.610 
looking for the perfect red lipstick and
I<00:00:58.210> thought<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:58.660> this<00:00:58.840> would<00:00:59.050> be<00:00:59.110> perfect

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
I thought that this would be perfect

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.160 
I thought that this would be perfect
this<00:01:00.040> is<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.250> wet<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.670> wild<00:01:01.150> and<00:01:01.630> this<00:01:01.900> is<00:01:02.020> the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
this is the wet and wild and this is the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.860 
this is the wet and wild and this is the
color<00:01:02.470> purdy<00:01:03.809> permissions<00:01:05.610> 970<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.690> would

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
color purdy permissions 970 and I would

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.570 
color purdy permissions 970 and I would
think<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.260> was<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.500> perfect<00:01:08.800> red<00:01:09.280> I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
think that it was the perfect red I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.450 
think that it was the perfect red I
picked<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:09.910> up<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.330> turned<00:01:10.630> out<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.460> it's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
picked it up and it turned out that it's

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.760 
picked it up and it turned out that it's
not<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.360> perfect<00:01:13.570> read<00:01:14.140> that<00:01:14.410> I'm<00:01:14.530> looking

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
not the perfect read that I'm looking

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.370 
not the perfect read that I'm looking
for<00:01:14.979> this<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.610> actually<00:01:16.180> kind<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.020> like<00:01:17.260> an

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
for this is actually kind of like an

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.080 
for this is actually kind of like an
orange<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:18.010> want<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.490> I'm<00:01:18.610> going<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.880> have

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
orange you want it and I'm going to have

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.420 
orange you want it and I'm going to have
the<00:01:19.509> picture<00:01:19.869> over<00:01:20.170> here<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.530> like<00:01:20.710> swatches

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
the picture over here up like swatches

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.030 
the picture over here up like swatches
and<00:01:21.700> how<00:01:22.300> it<00:01:22.450> looks<00:01:22.660> on<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.840> actual<00:01:23.320> lips<00:01:23.650> but

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
and how it looks on the actual lips but

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.609 
and how it looks on the actual lips but
it<00:01:24.369> is<00:01:24.910> that<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.750> would<00:01:26.020> think<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.530> was

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
it is that I would think that it was

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.040 
it is that I would think that it was
like<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.009> perfect<00:01:27.190> red<00:01:27.759> lip<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.450> it's

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
like the perfect red lip and it's

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.040 
like the perfect red lip and it's
actually<00:01:29.229> an<00:01:29.950> orange<00:01:30.520> ito<00:01:30.910> so<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.660> is<00:01:31.869> not

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
actually an orange ito so this is not

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.900 
actually an orange ito so this is not
actually<00:01:32.289> read<00:01:32.920> when<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.460> look<00:01:33.640> at<00:01:33.759> this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
actually read when you look at this

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.749 
actually read when you look at this
color<00:01:34.240> don't<00:01:35.140> think<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.100> going<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.460> be

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
color don't think that it's going to be

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.740 
color don't think that it's going to be
read<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.619> guess<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.220> depends<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.850> your<00:01:40.090> your

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
read and I guess it depends on your your

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.370 
read and I guess it depends on your your
lip<00:01:41.560> skin<00:01:41.860> town<00:01:42.130> but<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:43.180> me<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.780> period<00:01:44.080> for
