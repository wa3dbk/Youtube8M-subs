00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.059
 saved tudin of spazioogames are doctor 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.250
 white we are here today with a new video 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.049
 dedicated had 15 completed but we return 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.510
 with our squad builders after 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.520
 made that of schneider then of 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.619
 third player of the team of the week 20 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.140
 for the team of the week 21 I decided to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.330
 make one that contains two players 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.429
 that gave me electronics, you are 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.550
 already seeing the players are kabilia e 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.490
 ozil of the arsenal and from the newcastle 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 then two players of the bpl and that one 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.030
 that came out is a bit of a hybrid 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.470
 particular because it exploits the new 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.720
 system of agreements that you change 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.940
 we remember from 14 to 15 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.330
 in any case we immediately start the module is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.340
 a 4 3 3 5 I would say to skip check and 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.960
 cahill because we had already seen them in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 that of schneider we know that there is that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.210
 one of the best goalkeepers so to speak 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.090
 low cost of bpl what I respect 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.040
 obviously a short and solid cahill 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.560
 chelsea defender very good of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.060
 head one meter 93 high and also 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.000
 fairly fast 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.470
 let's start with maybe walker walker 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.909
 he is one of the strongest fullbacks 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.820
 probably the game above all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.799
 because at 91 of speed and eighty of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
 I also generally value good values 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.859
 defensive because 76 is not so scarce 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.770
 you see used in practically all 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.810
 very solid full-back bpl teams 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.390
 that I absolutely recommend 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.670
 try it if you haven't done it yet 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.679
 cahill 's mate is a defender who 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.790
 in the game it is very strong in reality 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.310
 I don't think so 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.640
 it's important because it's not like that anyway 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.460
 decisive in the koscielny reality in the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.350
 game with the 81 speed 82 defense a 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.390
 work meets normal high which is perfect 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.410
 for the defenders it becomes practically a 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.360
 Wall 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.190
 let alone the physical which is not the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.390
 its main feature 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.070
 promising them alongside cahill that a little 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.570
 more well placed 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.400
 therefore they complement each other perfectly 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.280
 we have two defenders behind 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.290
 in defense one fast the other however 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.330
 discreetly good at the head then 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.330
 an excellent defensive couple in my opinion the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.459
 best low cost for the bpl also 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.160
 better than eat these two players 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.900
 so I recommend them absolutely 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.190
 left-back masters melzer more than 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.110
 another for a matter of agreement 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.850
 however I preferred to put a full back 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.410
 with normal normal workers then 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.800
 that gave me a minimum of coverage 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.420
 because in front of them gundogan who acted 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.790
 saw it a holiday so I preferred 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.170
 cover me slightly in defense by passing 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.700
 in the midfield we find the front 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.470
 defense what in my opinion is the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.380
 median stronger than the game nemanja 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.420
 matic normal warren high one meter e 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.940
 94 of moratti height the values ​​are 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.830
 extraordinary for a median've never him 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.690
 and de rossi are the strongest medians of the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.489
 I play in general but I like it 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.709
 I highly recommend it is 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.720
 it's practically a front wall too 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.400
 just a wall because if you go against 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.230
 you lose the ball because of it 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.480
 physical will tear quietly 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.390
 so really do a lot of effort 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.580
 Then we find on how to Mazzarri 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.200
 so to speak we find diaby a player 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.640
 very unlucky in reality a meter e 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.350
 ninety so he too well placed 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.330
 physically normal in the now 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.180
 wordpress is therefore a midfield that yes 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.890
 complete well to excellent values ​​succeeds a 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.970
 do all the steps really a bit 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.610
 player considered for what 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.860
 it costs and gundogan he is the mezzala that goes 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.120
 to fit in with high normal 4 stars 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.950
 writes the four-star weak foot 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.209
 probably one of the best 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.459
 midfielders if not the best 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.390
 midfielder you can find in one 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.160
 bundesliga 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.670
 if you want you can find yourself well 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.680
 also adapt mario in this position 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.810
 abnormal normal then decreased 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.120
 slightly offensive charge 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.590
 let's move on to the players I 'd start with a 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.990
 player you know very well is 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.020
 swain sorry the pronunciation if wrong 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.460
 silver to anyway discrete statistics 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.410
 you see two games one goal and two assists 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.200
 it's not as devastating as when it was 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.210
 tip on fifa 13 pro however knows the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 made his sin for the skill stars e 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.330
 by itself weak that are only three though 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.580
 normal low of workers that I need 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.290
 a lot because why in this form 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.280
 I needed an outsider 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.630
 same alt to start again 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.250
 however, it is not bad in the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.140
 dribbling then player who 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.680
 I absolutely recommend we find then 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.480
 like a of Babylonian Newton 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.810
 he is a trequartista in the basic version 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.040
 pity it is external in this 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.320
 version because because it has excellent 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.090
 midfielder statistics is indeed more 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.640
 fast from ceasing however 86 of 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.280
 dribbling is very agile with 91 on 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.470
 card has good passages too 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.810
 a good finisher with 81 is therefore a 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.640
 pity it is external even if it is fine 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.280
 it's not bad because you look anyway 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.110
 four games three goals on the stand not 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.660
 it is bad 47 skill four stars for i 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.500
 weak so absolutely recommended 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.920
 and we find 9 mesut ozil che 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.390
 the same thing applies to him as well 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.670
 cagayan was born as a trequartista and yes 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.260
 move as as in its version in 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.990
 shape and it's a shame here too because 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.360
 have all the ideal statistics for one 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.520
 trequartista an excellent dribbling to a 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.580
 great ball control to a great one 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.620
 agility extraordinary passages 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.420
 the only defect is weak weak bile 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.970
 two weak foot stars that are a 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.550
 little can that used it as a 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.590
 ats you see who is going to take 7 thanks 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.690
 to the coach or if you don't want to 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.140
 the coach enough that he had played 10 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.440
 leave with him and go to 7 in agreement I must 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.690
 ozil say that I was not but I had 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.040
 very excited at the beginning but then me 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:39.920
 I changed my mind because in any case a 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.430
 player who makes 7 in four games 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.700
 goals 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.730
 understand that it is not bad at all it is indeed a 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.980
 Mr. false name and despite having 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.240
 just so to speak a foot because the 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.580
 only the president is usable 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.850
 left surprised me so if you look 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.840
 a fake ship a little different a little 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.160
 particular ozil could 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.220
 the solution that's right for you 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.690
 so if you have to use it like 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.210
 you absolutely want our outside 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.729
 use power plants instead not badly 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.919
 the team is very solid exploits the 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.910
 speed of kabilia that is in sui 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.280
 bands 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.010
 the insertions of goodman and diaby that 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.360
 they jump in to try to score 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.160
 then we have a very solid defense 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.229
 yes we know how to sort the ball 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.080
 beautifully and also knows how to finalize 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.540
 therefore absolutely positive magazine 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.280
 certainly you can't run with ozil then 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.930
 not launched in depth because it is not 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.210
 very fast he is a lot more player 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.360
 very technical then a team that 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.570
 however I don't mind a bit 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.520
 particular certainly not the team that 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.130
 he has a superstella as maybe he can 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.530
 being a mess though is a very team 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.039
 solid that really amuses me 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.229
 so then I recommend you tell me 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.240
 a little you maybe if you want to try it or 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.139
 what we will see again soon 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.139
 Hi everyone
