guess<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> grew<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.549> with<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
guess if you grew up with it you like it

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.469 
guess if you grew up with it you like it
I<00:02:06.450> don't<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.429> I<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:09.060> better<00:02:09.239> this

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I don't like it I think it's better this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.010 
I don't like it I think it's better this
way

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.210 

I<00:02:16.160> let<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.310> run<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:17.610> almost<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.720> full<00:02:18.960> minute

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
I let this run for almost a full minute

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.220 
I let this run for almost a full minute
it's<00:02:20.220> still<00:02:20.550> not<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:21.180> finely<00:02:21.660> ground<00:02:21.960> as<00:02:22.140> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
it's still not as finely ground as it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.680 
it's still not as finely ground as it
would<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.920> use<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> cocktail<00:02:23.910> mixer

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
would be if I use like a cocktail mixer

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.650 
would be if I use like a cocktail mixer
or<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.960> stick<00:02:25.230> blender<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.360> want

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
or a stick blender on it because I want

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.920 
or a stick blender on it because I want
little<00:02:27.960> pieces<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.560> corn<00:02:28.950> kernel<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.490> there<00:02:29.930> in

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
little pieces of corn kernel in there in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.840 
little pieces of corn kernel in there in
the<00:02:31.290> Venezuela<00:02:31.950> they<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> special

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the Venezuela they have a special

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150 
the Venezuela they have a special
machine<00:02:33.000> for<00:02:33.480> making<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.470> grinds<00:02:34.980> up

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
machine for making this and it grinds up

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.400 
machine for making this and it grinds up
the<00:02:35.370> mass<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.820> corn<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.170> leaves

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
the mass of the corn but it leaves

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.070 
the mass of the corn but it leaves
little<00:02:37.620> bits<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.130> whole<00:02:38.760> corn<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.450> we've

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
little bits of whole corn in it we've

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.280 
little bits of whole corn in it we've
used<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.410> stick<00:02:40.650> blender<00:02:40.830> or<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.840> drink<00:02:42.840> blender

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
used a stick blender or a drink blender

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.110 
used a stick blender or a drink blender
cocktail<00:02:43.710> blender<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.730> won't<00:02:44.970> leave

cocktail blender you won't leave
anything<00:02:45.390> it'll<00:02:45.690> be<00:02:45.840> absolutely<00:02:46.020> puree<00:02:46.890> again

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
anything it'll be absolutely puree again

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.940 
anything it'll be absolutely puree again
it's<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.780> traditional<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.770> not

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
it's not really traditional and it's not

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.560 
it's not really traditional and it's not
as<00:02:50.130> good<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.610> better<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.090> little<00:02:51.390> bits

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
as good it's better to have little bits

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.570 
as good it's better to have little bits
of<00:02:51.690> corn<00:02:51.960> in<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.560> use<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> food<00:02:52.980> processor

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
of corn in it so use a food processor

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.610 
of corn in it so use a food processor
and<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:53.820> let<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.750> run<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:55.140> for<00:02:55.410> quite<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
and just let it run for for quite a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.119 
and just let it run for for quite a
while

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.069 

food<00:02:59.849> processor<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.569> these<00:03:00.719> kinds<00:03:01.019> of

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
food processor with these kinds of

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.319 
food processor with these kinds of
blades<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.500> slice<00:03:02.010> no<00:03:02.579> matter<00:03:02.760> basically

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
blades that slice no matter basically

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.360 
blades that slice no matter basically
almost<00:03:03.959> no<00:03:04.200> matter<00:03:04.379> how<00:03:04.560> long<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.920> let<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.189> run

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
almost no matter how long you let it run

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.649 
almost no matter how long you let it run
it's<00:03:05.640> still<00:03:05.939> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.269> those<00:03:06.450> little

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
it's still going to have those little

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.479 
it's still going to have those little
bits<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.019> there<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.560> it'll<00:03:07.709> be<00:03:07.829> more<00:03:08.010> like<00:03:08.219> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
bits in there so it'll be more like the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.849 
bits in there so it'll be more like the
really<00:03:09.060> authentic<00:03:09.510> old<00:03:09.870> style<00:03:10.290> than<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> swell

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
really authentic old style than a swell

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:18.709 
really authentic old style than a swell
in<00:03:11.010> one

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:18.719 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.690 

yeah<00:03:19.719> they're<00:03:20.019> very<00:03:20.260> non-traditional<00:03:21.159> thing

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
yeah they're very non-traditional thing

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.220 
yeah they're very non-traditional thing

this<00:03:48.400> butter<00:03:48.700> down<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:54.040> size<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.669> make

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
this butter down and the size you make

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.339 
this butter down and the size you make
of<00:03:55.090> these<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.359> know<00:03:55.480> obviously<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.079> up<00:03:56.200> to

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
of these you know obviously it's up to

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.149 
of these you know obviously it's up to
you<00:03:56.439> is<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.620> it's<00:03:57.129> all<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.430> same<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.950> can

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
you is it it's all the same and you can

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.849 
you is it it's all the same and you can
you<00:04:00.489> can<00:04:00.639> put<00:04:00.909> it<00:04:01.030> in<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> little<00:04:01.389> ladle<00:04:01.620> but<00:04:02.620> it

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
you can put it in a little ladle but it

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.890 
you can put it in a little ladle but it
takes<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.189> while<00:04:03.340> before<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.790> firms<00:04:04.120> up<00:04:04.359> so<00:04:04.840> you

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
takes a while before it firms up so you

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.360 
takes a while before it firms up so you
can<00:04:05.109> just<00:04:05.319> do<00:04:05.439> it<00:04:05.469> like<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.859> with<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.069> spatula

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
can just do it like this with a spatula

got you got plenty of time here to

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.740 
got you got plenty of time here to
smooth<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:34.000> out<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:35.849> because<00:04:36.849> I've<00:04:37.210> made<00:04:37.539> this

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
smooth it out and because I've made this

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.170 
smooth it out and because I've made this
thick<00:04:38.199> it's<00:04:39.130> going<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.460> take<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.639> little<00:04:39.849> bit<00:04:40.000> of

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
thick it's going to take a little bit of

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.390 
thick it's going to take a little bit of
art<00:04:40.479> here<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.930> smooth<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.620> around<00:04:41.800> make<00:04:42.370> it

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
art here to smooth it around make it

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.969 
art here to smooth it around make it
even<00:04:42.789> if<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.539> was<00:04:43.690> making<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:44.710> way<00:04:44.830> the

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
even if I was making it the way the

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.469 
even if I was making it the way the
street<00:04:45.250> vendors<00:04:45.639> make<00:04:45.849> it<00:04:46.030> where<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:46.180> like<00:04:46.449> a

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
street vendors make it where it's like a

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.120 
street vendors make it where it's like a
puree<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.110> that's<00:04:47.229> really<00:04:47.500> liquid<00:04:47.949> with<00:04:48.099> a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
puree and that's really liquid with a

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.770 
puree and that's really liquid with a
lot<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.400> cream<00:04:48.669> in<00:04:48.699> it<00:04:48.909> because<00:04:49.300> cream<00:04:49.599> is<00:04:49.750> a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
lot of cream in it because cream is a

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.719 
lot of cream in it because cream is a
lot<00:04:50.020> cheaper<00:04:50.229> than<00:04:50.409> corn<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.370> think<00:04:51.400> their

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
lot cheaper than corn I think their

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.490 
lot cheaper than corn I think their
ingredients<00:04:52.330> they<00:04:52.720> get<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:53.020> pour<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.470> like

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
ingredients they get it pour it like

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.740 
ingredients they get it pour it like
pancake<00:04:54.190> batter<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.669> it'll<00:04:55.210> it'll<00:04:55.449> smooth

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
pancake batter and it'll it'll smooth

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.110 
pancake batter and it'll it'll smooth
out<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:57.430> know<00:04:57.550> there's<00:04:57.759> something<00:04:57.940> to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
out it so you know there's something to

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.270 
out it so you know there's something to
be<00:04:58.300> said<00:04:58.330> for<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:58.990> like<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.949> this<00:05:00.070> way<00:05:00.250> I

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
be said for that I like it this way I

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.779 
be said for that I like it this way I
like<00:05:00.610> it

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
like it

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.180 
like it
really<00:05:01.270> thick<00:05:01.509> with<00:05:01.990> visible<00:05:02.409> pieces<00:05:02.620> of<00:05:02.919> corn

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
really thick with visible pieces of corn

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.600 
really thick with visible pieces of corn
in<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:04.090> they<00:05:04.270> suit<00:05:04.810> yourself

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
in it so they suit yourself

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.390 
in it so they suit yourself
okay<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.120> pretty<00:05:07.389> smooth<00:05:07.690> so<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:09.070> even

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
okay this is pretty smooth so and even

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.740 
okay this is pretty smooth so and even
so<00:05:09.550> I'm<00:05:09.669> just<00:05:09.849> going<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.060> leave<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.570> cook

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
so I'm just going to leave this to cook

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.879 
so I'm just going to leave this to cook
for<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.020> few<00:05:11.110> moments<00:05:12.479> is<00:05:13.479> about<00:05:13.990> four<00:05:14.650> or<00:05:14.710> five

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
for a few moments is about four or five

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.980 
for a few moments is about four or five
minutes<00:05:15.220> later<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.669> only<00:05:16.060> real<00:05:16.330> trick<00:05:16.810> to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
minutes later the only real trick to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.409 
minutes later the only real trick to
this<00:05:17.139> at<00:05:17.470> all<00:05:17.680> is<00:05:18.099> knowing<00:05:18.669> when<00:05:18.909> to<00:05:18.940> flip<00:05:19.240> it

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
this at all is knowing when to flip it

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.260 
this at all is knowing when to flip it
and<00:05:20.199> if<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.710> do<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.159> too<00:05:21.340> soon<00:05:21.550> it'll<00:05:22.000> fall

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
and if you do it too soon it'll fall

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.519 
and if you do it too soon it'll fall
apart<00:05:22.500> if<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.800> too<00:05:23.979> late<00:05:24.159> it'll<00:05:24.340> be<00:05:24.490> burned

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
apart if you do too late it'll be burned

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.409 
apart if you do too late it'll be burned
this<00:05:26.529> is<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.830> beautiful<00:05:27.130> golden<00:05:27.880> color<00:05:27.940> you
