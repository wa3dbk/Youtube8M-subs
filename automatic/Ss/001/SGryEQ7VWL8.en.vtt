00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.330
 now I 'm going to show you the 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.880
 flint working brand s 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.799
 to see how quickly it 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.799
 can make a fire 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.650
 first we must have what we are going to 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.700
 learn in this case is going to be a piece 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 of sanitary paper 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.650
 It should be mentioned that it is important that 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.160
 that is going to learn must be particles 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.880
 fine debris chips and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.520
 dry 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.990
 and the other very important issue is 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.830
 it is not enough 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.550
 making a spark with the flint is 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:50.200
 necessary first scrape gently 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.200
 about what we are going to burn 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.760
 to generate some dust from it 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.970
 magnesium once we've done 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.540
 enough of this what we're going to do 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.220
 is to give a spark so that this can 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 ignite a spark on the material to 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 burn 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.710
 and there is a time 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.619
 I'm going to show you one of the legs more 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 versatile and economical of the market 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.640
 warrior leg 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 It has several compartments 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.900
 for example you can not get here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.900
 comfortably 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.510
 money in the hand 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.040
 here we have 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.950
 another bag 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.890
 and in the main compartment there is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 enough space for the conaie
