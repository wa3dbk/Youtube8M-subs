all right folks um Ranger Josh here um

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
just thought i would take a look at my

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.029 
just thought i would take a look at my
new<00:00:15.730> firearm<00:00:16.730> i<00:00:16.820> just<00:00:17.030> purchased<00:00:18.039> the

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
new firearm i just purchased the

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:29.470 
new firearm i just purchased the
Dominion<00:00:20.030> arms<00:00:20.510> model<00:00:21.500> 18<00:00:22.510> 1887<00:00:23.510> um<00:00:24.670> t2<00:00:28.360> it<00:00:29.360> was

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
Dominion arms model 18 1887 um t2 it was

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.380 
Dominion arms model 18 1887 um t2 it was
simply<00:00:30.110> because<00:00:30.290> I<00:00:30.350> meant<00:00:30.500> after<00:00:30.800> the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
simply because I meant after the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.020 
simply because I meant after the
Terminator<00:00:32.390> 2<00:00:32.660> shotgun<00:00:33.590> that<00:00:33.800> already<00:00:34.219> uses

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.900 

this<00:00:38.030> is<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:38.329> here<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:41.530> it's<00:00:42.530> got<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.910> standard

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
this is it here so it's got the standard

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.759 
this is it here so it's got the standard
Libra<00:00:44.269> loop<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:44.989> it<00:00:45.109> doesn't<00:00:45.350> have<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.530> large

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
Libra loop so it doesn't have the large

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.279 
Libra loop so it doesn't have the large
labor<00:00:46.039> loop<00:00:46.449> just<00:00:47.449> probably<00:00:47.629> good<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.050> people

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
labor loop just probably good so people

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.200 
labor loop just probably good so people
don't<00:00:48.440> blow<00:00:48.800> their<00:00:49.010> arms<00:00:49.309> or<00:00:49.489> feel<00:00:49.760> when

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
don't blow their arms or feel when

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.000 
don't blow their arms or feel when
they're<00:00:50.329> trying<00:00:50.539> to<00:00:50.659> play<00:00:51.019> with<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:54.559> cycles

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
they're trying to play with it it cycles

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.639 
they're trying to play with it it cycles
pretty<00:00:55.190> well<00:00:55.399> I've<00:00:55.760> heard<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.449> noren<00:00:56.929> koh<00:00:57.140> or
