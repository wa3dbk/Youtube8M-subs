notice it's a four pole connector and
that's<00:01:05.960> what<00:01:06.170> gives<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.530> your<00:01:06.909> iPod<00:01:07.909> or<00:01:07.940> phone

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
that's what gives you your iPod or phone

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.780 
that's what gives you your iPod or phone
controls<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.890> gold-plated<00:01:10.580> at<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
controls and it is gold-plated at the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.740 
controls and it is gold-plated at the
top<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.450> again<00:01:12.200> very<00:01:12.500> nice<00:01:12.710> design<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:14.180> this

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
top so again very nice design so this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.160 
top so again very nice design so this
thing<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.350> both<00:01:15.830> an<00:01:16.040> amplifier<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.210> basically

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
thing is both an amplifier and basically

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.500 
thing is both an amplifier and basically
like<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> hook<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.370> can<00:01:19.580> use<00:01:19.760> your<00:01:19.790> your

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
like a hook in so you can use your your

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.920 
like a hook in so you can use your your
own<00:01:20.750> phone<00:01:21.460> while<00:01:22.460> you're<00:01:22.610> listening<00:01:23.090> so

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
own phone while you're listening so

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.450 
own phone while you're listening so
let's<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:24.650> ahead<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.950> give<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.190> thing<00:01:25.400> a

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
let's go ahead and give this thing a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.750 
let's go ahead and give this thing a
shot<00:01:25.550> so<00:01:26.210> we're<00:01:26.360> going<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.510> take<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:27.760> and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
shot so we're going to take this and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.660 
shot so we're going to take this and
plug<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:29.480> into<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.840> top<00:01:30.110> there<00:01:30.440> let's<00:01:31.340> take

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
plug it into the top there let's take

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:43.590 
plug it into the top there let's take
this<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:33.590> goes<00:01:33.800> into<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.250> bottle

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.920 

all<00:01:44.560> right<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.010> first<00:01:45.460> notice<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.479> the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
all right so first notice that the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.260 
all right so first notice that the
powers<00:01:47.350> not<00:01:47.590> on<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:49.330> power<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.659> not<00:01:49.900> on

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
powers not on here the power is not on

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.480 
powers not on here the power is not on
if<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.540> turn<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.110> then<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.860> see<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.220> light

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
if I turn it on then you see that light

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.060 
if I turn it on then you see that light
but<00:01:54.729> it's<00:01:54.850> off<00:01:55.060> but<00:01:55.510> look<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.650> can<00:01:56.800> still

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
but it's off but look you can still

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.120 
but it's off but look you can still
control<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:58.060> volume<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.630> phone<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.950> is

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
control the volume of the phone which is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.320 
control the volume of the phone which is
very<00:02:00.520> very<00:02:01.119> nice<00:02:01.450> if<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.650> hit<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:04.060> plays

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
very very nice if I hit that it plays

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.840 
very very nice if I hit that it plays
and<00:02:04.660> again<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.740> power<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.130> off<00:02:07.259> see<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.759> it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
and again the power is off see and it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.120 
and again the power is off see and it
again<00:02:10.149> stops<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.650> do<00:02:11.800> your<00:02:11.950> voice

commands you can do all kinds of things

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.400 
commands you can do all kinds of things
but<00:02:14.980> your<00:02:15.910> volume<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.540> down<00:02:16.570> now<00:02:17.020> if<00:02:17.260> we

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
but your volume up and down now if we

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.040 
but your volume up and down now if we
turn<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.220> turns<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> amplifier<00:02:19.780> on

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
turn it on that turns the amplifier on

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.030 
turn it on that turns the amplifier on
this<00:02:20.680> still<00:02:20.980> controls<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.850> up<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.660> down<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
this still controls it up and down and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.390 
this still controls it up and down and
still<00:02:24.250> plays<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.910> pauses<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.130> still

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
still plays and pauses so that all still

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880 
still plays and pauses so that all still
works<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> same<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.780> here's<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
works the same and here's the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
works the same and here's the
interesting<00:02:30.130> thing<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.850> bass<00:02:31.150> boost

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
interesting thing you have a bass boost

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.320 
interesting thing you have a bass boost
up<00:02:31.720> here<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.680> can<00:02:32.890> turn<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.250> or<00:02:33.280> off<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.120> that

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
up here you can turn on or off so that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.479 
up here you can turn on or off so that
kind<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.660> gives<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.019> thing<00:02:35.260> now<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.100> one

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
kind of gives you a thing now the one

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.280 
kind of gives you a thing now the one
thing<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.760> will<00:02:36.940> note<00:02:37.090> about<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.080> bait

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
thing I will note about this is the bait

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.800 
thing I will note about this is the bait
the<00:02:38.590> amplifier<00:02:39.430> only<00:02:39.700> jumps<00:02:40.209> at<00:02:40.330> about<00:02:40.540> maybe

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
the amplifier only jumps at about maybe

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.729 
the amplifier only jumps at about maybe
10%<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.920> not<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> huge<00:02:42.550> boost<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.440> get

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
10% it's not a huge boost but you do get

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.410 
10% it's not a huge boost but you do get
that<00:02:44.890> bass<00:02:45.130> boost<00:02:45.550> which<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.940> nice<00:02:46.180> because

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that bass boost which is nice because

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.120 
that bass boost which is nice because
it's<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.810> hardware<00:02:47.080> built-in<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.040> it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
it's a hardware built-in one and it

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.550 
it's a hardware built-in one and it
actually<00:02:48.459> does<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> pretty<00:02:48.790> decent<00:02:49.090> job<00:02:49.560> so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
actually does a pretty decent job so

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.150 
actually does a pretty decent job so
that's<00:02:51.010> pretty<00:02:51.400> nice<00:02:51.640> there<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.239> then<00:02:52.840> if<00:02:53.830> you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
that's pretty nice there and then if you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:10.880 
that's pretty nice there and then if you
hold<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.549> down<00:02:59.280> play<00:03:00.280> Timbaland

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.680 

so<00:03:11.460> they're<00:03:11.670> very<00:03:11.700> cool<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.270> have<00:03:12.390> your<00:03:12.570> voice

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
so they're very cool you have your voice

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.780 
so they're very cool you have your voice
controls<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.590> well<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.520> do

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
controls there as well and you can do

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.010 
controls there as well and you can do
that<00:03:15.000> when<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:15.330> off<00:03:15.510> turn<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.380> off<00:03:21.020> play

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
that when it's off turn it off play

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:30.750 
that when it's off turn it off play
songs<00:03:22.380> by<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.430> Commodores

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.000 

so<00:03:31.420> there<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.470> can<00:03:32.500> do<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:32.800> with

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
so there you have it you can do it with

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.119 
so there you have it you can do it with
both<00:03:33.040> on<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:34.000> off<00:03:34.750> which<00:03:35.349> is<00:03:35.500> beautiful<00:03:35.950> and

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
both on and off which is beautiful and

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.770 
both on and off which is beautiful and
that<00:03:36.190> mic<00:03:36.819> right<00:03:37.090> there<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:39.819> mic<00:03:40.060> allows

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
that mic right there and the mic allows

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.970 
that mic right there and the mic allows
you<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.379> basically<00:03:41.709> go<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.260> use<00:03:44.260> this<00:03:44.650> with

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
you to basically go in and use this with

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.190 
you to basically go in and use this with
any<00:03:45.280> set<00:03:45.879> of<00:03:46.000> headphones<00:03:46.209> any<00:03:46.810> set<00:03:47.110> of

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
any set of headphones any set of

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.449 
any set of headphones any set of
headphones<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.709> want<00:03:47.920> at<00:03:48.040> all

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
headphones you want at all

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.199 
headphones you want at all
I'm<00:03:48.879> currently<00:03:49.269> using<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:51.840> biodynamic<00:03:54.209> t-50

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
I'm currently using the biodynamic t-50

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.150 
I'm currently using the biodynamic t-50
is<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.780> usually<00:03:56.140> come<00:03:56.379> with<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.560> microphone

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
is that usually come with a microphone

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.520 
is that usually come with a microphone
so<00:03:57.790> being<00:03:58.180> able<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.450> do<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.110> clip<00:03:59.379> this

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
so being able to do that you clip this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.670 
so being able to do that you clip this
on<00:03:59.709> your<00:03:59.890> shirt<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.909> all<00:04:01.030> works<00:04:01.299> perfectly

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
on your shirt and it all works perfectly

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.860 
on your shirt and it all works perfectly
so<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:03.250> is<00:04:03.489> more<00:04:03.760> than<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.390> portable

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
so this is more than just a portable

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.569 
so this is more than just a portable
amplifier<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.680> also<00:04:06.069> gives<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.430> the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
amplifier this also gives you the

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.610 
amplifier this also gives you the
ability<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.150> wear<00:04:07.810> your<00:04:07.959> headphones<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
ability to wear your headphones and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.199 
ability to wear your headphones and
answer<00:04:08.890> phone<00:04:09.099> calls<00:04:09.400> without<00:04:09.579> taking<00:04:10.180> your

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
answer phone calls without taking your

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.490 
answer phone calls without taking your
headphones<00:04:10.750> off<00:04:11.019> so<00:04:11.799> that's<00:04:12.640> it's<00:04:13.569> fantastic

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
headphones off so that's it's fantastic

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.300 
headphones off so that's it's fantastic
I<00:04:14.620> mean<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.910> it's<00:04:16.510> very<00:04:16.870> useful<00:04:17.410> again<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
I mean it's it's very useful again the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.270 
I mean it's it's very useful again the
amp<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.789> it<00:04:18.910> isn't<00:04:19.299> super<00:04:19.630> strong<00:04:19.959> but<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:21.039> does

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
amp in it isn't super strong but it does

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.800 
amp in it isn't super strong but it does
come<00:04:21.489> with<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.699> bass<00:04:21.910> boost<00:04:22.180> it<00:04:22.419> gives<00:04:22.690> you

come with a bass boost it gives you

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.510 
come with a bass boost it gives you
about<00:04:23.020> 10<00:04:23.320> percent<00:04:23.680> over<00:04:23.740> what<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> regular

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
about 10 percent over what the regular

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.219 
about 10 percent over what the regular
one<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.180> gives<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.419> a<00:04:25.449> bass<00:04:25.690> boost<00:04:25.930> so
