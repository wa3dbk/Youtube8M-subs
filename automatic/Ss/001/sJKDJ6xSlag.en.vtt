the<00:00:47.730> game<00:00:47.910> missed<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.629> could<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.230> been<00:00:49.320> in

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

the storyline that they touched upon a
bit<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> psychological<00:00:53.070> aspect

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
bit was the kind of psychological aspect

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.799 
bit was the kind of psychological aspect
of<00:00:54.199> way<00:00:55.199> being<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> police<00:00:56.129> officer<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.820> being

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of way being a police officer and being

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.200

undercover<00:00:58.320> doing<00:00:58.890> things<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.489> he<00:00:59.820> believes

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
undercover doing things that he believes

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.930 
undercover doing things that he believes
in<00:01:00.390> his<00:01:00.510> code<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:00.989> morally<00:01:01.410> wrong<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.730> for

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
in his code are morally wrong but for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.539 
in his code are morally wrong but for
the<00:01:03.000> greater<00:01:03.239> good<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.290> kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> touched

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the greater good so they kind of touched

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.820 
the greater good so they kind of touched
upon<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.659> points<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:07.680> think

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
upon it in some points but I don't think

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
upon it in some points but I don't think
they<00:01:07.950> expanded<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> well<00:01:08.939> i'm<00:01:09.180> also<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.410 
they expanded it that well i'm also the
right<00:01:10.260> relationship<00:01:11.250> between<00:01:11.670> him<00:01:11.909> coming

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
right relationship between him coming

exploring this more this game is set on

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.210 
exploring this more this game is set on
Hong<00:01:26.820> Kong<00:01:26.850> Island<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.259> same<00:01:28.500> locations

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
Hong Kong Island is the same locations

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
Hong Kong Island is the same locations
as<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.579> real<00:01:29.790> Hong<00:01:30.030> Kong<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.540> obviously<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
as a real Hong Kong but obviously it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.920 
as a real Hong Kong but obviously it's
compressed<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.860> bit<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.549> fit<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.600> make<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
compressed a bit to fit in to make the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
compressed a bit to fit in to make the
map<00:01:34.079> size<00:01:34.350> good<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.400> map<00:01:35.549> size

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
map size good and I think the map size

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.319 
map size good and I think the map size
was<00:01:36.030> absolutely<00:01:36.869> great<00:01:37.759> wasn't<00:01:38.759> too<00:01:39.000> small

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
was absolutely great wasn't too small

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
was absolutely great wasn't too small
that<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> remembered<00:01:41.520> everywhere

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that you kind of remembered everywhere

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.940 
that you kind of remembered everywhere
and<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.750> fasting<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.740> side<00:01:43.920> of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and it was fasting it from one side of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
and it was fasting it from one side of
the<00:01:44.070> other<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.759> wasn't<00:01:45.000> too<00:01:45.119> large<00:01:45.360> where

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the other but wasn't too large where

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
the other but wasn't too large where
every<00:01:46.619> single<00:01:46.950> setting<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> different

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
every single setting is a different

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.370 
every single setting is a different
place<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.630> recognize<00:01:48.960> anything

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
place and you don't recognize anything

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.679

for<00:01:49.740> most<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> time<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> map<00:01:51.149> size<00:01:51.390> was

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
for most of the time so the map size was

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.170 
for most of the time so the map size was
great<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.799> other<00:01:53.189> art<00:01:53.579> style<00:01:53.939> and

that<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.360> game<00:02:00.570> created<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.080> Hong<00:02:01.320> Kong<00:02:01.560> felt

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
that this game created of Hong Kong felt

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.370 
that this game created of Hong Kong felt
like<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> real<00:02:02.670> Hong<00:02:03.030> Kong<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.480> think<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.020> was

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
like the real Hong Kong I think I was

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.470 
like the real Hong Kong I think I was
there<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.620> couple<00:02:04.710> he's<00:02:05.100> good<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.790> yeah<00:02:05.910> that

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
there a couple he's good but yeah that

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.870 
there a couple he's good but yeah that
was<00:02:06.660> here<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.930> created<00:02:07.410> felt<00:02:08.070> like<00:02:08.400> the<00:02:08.670> real

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
was here this created felt like the real

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.420 
was here this created felt like the real
Hong<00:02:09.180> Kong<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:10.020> beautiful<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.190> was

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
Hong Kong it was beautiful and it was

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.490 
Hong Kong it was beautiful and it was
just<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.480> great<00:02:12.750> setting<00:02:13.110> overall

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
just I think a great setting overall

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
just I think a great setting overall
because<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.100> quite<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> different<00:02:15.180> place

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
because it's quite a different place

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720 
because it's quite a different place
than<00:02:15.390> most<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> American<00:02:16.680> cities<00:02:17.010> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
than most of the American cities that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.660 
than most of the American cities that
like<00:02:18.180> GTA<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.930> stuff<00:02:19.200> are<00:02:19.500> set<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.250> because

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
like GTA and stuff are set in because

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.880 
like GTA and stuff are set in because
it's<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.210> different<00:02:21.450> made<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.260> feel<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
