00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
much more cooler but I would probably

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.360 
much more cooler but I would probably
only<00:03:37.750> get<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.140> set<00:03:38.470> for<00:03:38.830> like<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.220> little

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
set in the twin blade so you can get a

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.400 
set in the twin blade so you can get a
lavar<00:03:50.920> thyssen<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.520> lot<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.110> opportunity<00:03:53.110> sets
