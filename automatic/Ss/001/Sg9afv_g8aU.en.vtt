00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.690
 hello to all and so hard externally and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.489
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.620
 have the panorama on all devices 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.080
 who do not have to bring us back as 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 the ipad 2 and the fourth ipod touch 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.540
 generation it was working on 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.120
 the iphone 4 the ipod touch 4th generation and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 all iPad could see that but 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.250
 an ipad he has the panorama mode so here it is 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.850
 after that it's not very practical to do 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.500
 panels 1 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.240
 because I'm in a dog but 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 frankly it's not very beautiful better 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 to make a panoramic photo 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.300
 that's why I 'm not going 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 not show you but it can 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.860
 do when I showed on an ipad in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.560
 here is an ipad so I climbed the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
 tweak that must be installed to enjoy 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.100
 from this we can see that these two 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.770
 devices normally that does not have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.850
 d the panorama so I'll maybe its 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.220
 brand darling currie maybe from 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.760
 fourth generation the iphone 4 and the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.119
 ipad 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.350
 So here we are going to sell so much cydia 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.750
 to show you what you need 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 install so to have it you need 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.290
 to make you open in marked cydia 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 fashion signs and yes the tweet tweet 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 undermine our modes so that it is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.159
 compatible with iphone 3gs iphone 4 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.110
 ipad 2 with pat riley betrayed no 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.850
 program nor for how much me first 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.590
 generation excuse me so it's like 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.759
 hasty with maya six names like I had 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.930
 me it will seem to you disable all 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.290
 the other old devices like 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 ipad 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.429
 there he can you of fourth generation 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.290
 so that's just a moment that it works 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.400
 perfectly 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.290
 so it's just that it will have more than 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.329
 it's an old device that's also 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 this tweak that has a function what 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.890
 actually allows to change a little the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.220
 panorama mode like the custom to your 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.350
 way 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.390
 So here I am I will rather you 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.400
 interests I was interested but now 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.230
 to show you how the activated 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.549
 on older devices so once 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.750
 Did you install you ask 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.360
 to see margins of the device you to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.160
 tell them 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.130
 done it will have to go in the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.090
 settings of your device so voila 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.680
 you go to the fashion panels section 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.120
 fashion and fofana signs is born want 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.950
 panorama if activated directly 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.300
 after you can edit it because 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.100
 that they modify again it's a step 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.030
 very important for example just to 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.730
 show one of the navigation functions 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.280
 could change the text so by 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.520
 example I slip everything is 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:04.870
 extremely hard and you are instead 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:07.480
 so here's pan tilt 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.860
 go power here's external hard so 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.680
 here it was direct with you show 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.020
 how to activate the panoramic mode on 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.570
 old devices like the iphone 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.310
 3gs iphone 4 ipod touch 4th 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.330
 changed all the ipad you say 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.770
 from antenna to paris but also all those 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.150
 who do not have panorama rap 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.830
