Cena was actually going for gas first
and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.220> he's<00:01:20.340> probably<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

and then he's probably going to this
pool<00:01:21.119> afterwards<00:01:21.540> instead<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.229> from

pool afterwards instead of going from
expansion<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:23.310> both<00:01:23.780> couldn't<00:01:24.780> scout<00:01:25.080> the

expansion they both couldn't scout the
other<00:01:25.380> players<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.100> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.400> needed<00:01:26.670> to

get<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.960> early<00:01:28.320> pool<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.369> in

check out really quick 13 harvesters

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.610 
check out really quick 13 harvesters
each<00:03:04.330> actually<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:04.870> things<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.170> pretty<00:03:05.470> much

focusing<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.590> those<00:03:44.680> roaches<00:03:44.920> with<00:03:45.220> his<00:03:45.340> gas

he's<00:03:46.120> not<00:03:46.390> producing<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:48.010> not<00:03:48.340> getting<00:03:48.640> a

he's not producing a is not getting a

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.890 
he's not producing a is not getting a
link<00:03:49.060> speed<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.360> it's<00:03:49.480> going<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.660> be<00:03:49.720> roaches

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
link speed so it's going to be roaches

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.990 
link speed so it's going to be roaches
versus<00:03:50.410> Ling's<00:03:50.590> with<00:03:50.799> speed<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.640> Bailey

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.180 
versus Ling's with speed and the Bailey
nice<00:03:52.180> going<00:03:52.450> up<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:52.690> well<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.680> Z<00:03:53.860> are<00:03:54.010> going<00:03:54.130> to

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
nice going up as well so Z are going to

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.430 
nice going up as well so Z are going to
try<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.370> pull<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.730> same<00:03:54.910> thing<00:03:55.120> as<00:03:55.239> before

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
try and pull the same thing as before

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.260 
try and pull the same thing as before
going<00:03:56.440> with<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.709> banelings<00:03:59.489> ret<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.640> think

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
going with the banelings ret I think

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.640 
going with the banelings ret I think
might<00:04:01.480> be<00:04:01.599> better<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.870> produce<00:04:02.140> more<00:04:02.290> roaches

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
might be better to produce more roaches

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.520 
might be better to produce more roaches
last<00:04:03.310> game<00:04:03.490> he<00:04:03.640> produced<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:04.000> lot<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.240> zerglings

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
last game he produced a lot of zerglings

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.620 
last game he produced a lot of zerglings
I<00:04:05.530> mean<00:04:05.890> he<00:04:05.950> had<00:04:06.069> extra<00:04:06.340> minerals<00:04:06.520> but<00:04:06.819> this

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
I mean he had extra minerals but this

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.750 
I mean he had extra minerals but this
time<00:04:07.750> getting<00:04:08.020> a<00:04:08.110> second<00:04:08.470> gas<00:04:08.650> as<00:04:08.950> well<00:04:09.220> so

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
time getting a second gas as well so

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.559 
time getting a second gas as well so
it's<00:04:09.849> going<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.030> be<00:04:10.090> able<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.360> actually

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
it's going to be able to actually

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.500 
it's going to be able to actually
produce<00:04:10.900> more<00:04:11.260> roaches<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.830> time<00:04:12.510> hopefully

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
produce more roaches this time hopefully

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.420 
produce more roaches this time hopefully
since<00:04:14.500> those<00:04:14.680> are<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:14.920> do<00:04:15.010> well<00:04:15.190> against

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
since those are going to do well against

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.289 
since those are going to do well against
the<00:04:15.459> banelings<00:04:15.819> he<00:04:15.910> doesn't<00:04:16.090> know<00:04:16.150> what's

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
the banelings he doesn't know what's

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.580 
the banelings he doesn't know what's
coming<00:04:16.359> from<00:04:16.720> Zinio<00:04:17.080> though<00:04:17.260> at<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.500> point

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
coming from Zinio though at this point

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.320 
coming from Zinio though at this point
so<00:04:18.340> he<00:04:18.400> doesn't<00:04:18.609> know<00:04:18.669> that<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.849> vainly<00:04:19.120> nest

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
so he doesn't know that the vainly nest

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.180 
so he doesn't know that the vainly nest
is<00:04:19.450> almost<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.930> way<00:04:20.049> zergling<00:04:20.799> is<00:04:20.950> hiding

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
is almost on the way zergling is hiding

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.290 
is almost on the way zergling is hiding
at<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.340> edge<00:04:21.520> probably<00:04:21.910> going<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.090> try<00:04:22.270> and

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
at the edge probably going to try and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.100 
at the edge probably going to try and
morph<00:04:22.660> those<00:04:22.840> into<00:04:23.050> banelings<00:04:24.900> i'm<00:04:25.900> not<00:04:26.020> sure

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
morph those into banelings i'm not sure

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.300 
morph those into banelings i'm not sure

right<00:05:14.470> just<00:05:14.680> continuing<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.190> produce<00:05:15.370> roaches

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
right just continuing to produce roaches

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.719 
right just continuing to produce roaches
he's<00:05:16.750> got<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.169> few<00:05:17.560> less<00:05:17.770> harvesters<00:05:18.370> from<00:05:18.580> all

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
he's got a few less harvesters from all

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.159 
he's got a few less harvesters from all
that<00:05:18.849> stuff<00:05:19.180> going<00:05:19.450> on<00:05:19.510> in<00:05:19.660> his<00:05:19.720> base<00:05:19.930> though

that stuff going on in his base though

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.320 
that stuff going on in his base though
so<00:05:20.620> a<00:05:20.650> little<00:05:21.400> bit<00:05:21.550> bad<00:05:21.700> in<00:05:21.849> that<00:05:21.970> sense<00:05:22.180> but

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
so a little bit bad in that sense but

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.880 
so a little bit bad in that sense but

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
up with the roaches and get the roaches

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.610 
up with the roaches and get the roaches
to<00:05:29.860> follow<00:05:30.130> up<00:05:30.400> like<00:05:31.090> he<00:05:31.210> did<00:05:31.240> last<00:05:31.390> game<00:05:31.780> but

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.500 
to follow up like he did last game but
these<00:05:32.800> speed<00:05:33.070> lakes<00:05:33.280> are<00:05:33.430> see<00:05:33.820> everything<00:05:34.300> and

these speed lakes are see everything and
i'm<00:05:34.570> not<00:05:34.690> sure<00:05:34.750> why<00:05:34.990> they're<00:05:35.140> not<00:05:35.169> doing
