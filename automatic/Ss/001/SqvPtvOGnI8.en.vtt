00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.099 
modern and as you can see in your screen
we<00:00:14.490> are<00:00:14.639> playing<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> new<00:00:15.450> beta<00:00:15.780> client

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
we are playing on the new beta client

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.090 
we are playing on the new beta client
because<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:17.670> can't<00:00:18.090> plan<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> Roma<00:00:18.810> client<00:00:19.260> it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
because we can't plan the Roma client it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.470 
because we can't plan the Roma client it
actually<00:00:20.369> took<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> while<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> figure<00:00:21.240> out

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
actually took me a while to figure out

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.300 
actually took me a while to figure out
how<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> even<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.680> fit<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
how to even get this to fit the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.929 
how to even get this to fit the
appropriate<00:00:23.760> resolution<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.510> record<00:00:25.170> at<00:00:25.939> but

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
appropriate resolution a record at but

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.300 
appropriate resolution a record at but
here<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.510> are<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.099> playing

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
some nya and yeah that basically I was

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.549 
some nya and yeah that basically I was
playing<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:36.149> could<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.170> seen<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
playing a little bit as could be seen in

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.770 
playing a little bit as could be seen in
my<00:00:37.710> previous<00:00:37.950> videos<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.969> greenway

aether<00:00:40.140> vial<00:00:40.379> deck<00:00:40.790> wasn't<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:41.940> impressed

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
aether vial deck wasn't really impressed

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.610 
aether vial deck wasn't really impressed
by<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.510> power<00:00:42.780> level<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> individual

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
by the power level of the individual

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
by the power level of the individual
cards<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> deck<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:45.149> possible<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
cards in the deck and it's possible that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.389 
cards in the deck and it's possible that
that<00:00:45.870> particular<00:00:46.050> build<00:00:46.469> wasn't<00:00:46.829> great<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.250> may

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that particular build wasn't great I may

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.680 
that particular build wasn't great I may
still<00:00:47.670> mess<00:00:47.879> around<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.120> little<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
still mess around a little bit with that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.690 
still mess around a little bit with that
but<00:00:49.379> no<00:00:49.530> much<00:00:49.649> time<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.430> thursday

this is a deck that you know i have i
have<00:00:58.020> enjoyed<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.219> long<00:00:59.370> time<00:00:59.430> this

have enjoyed for a very long time this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
have enjoyed for a very long time this
general<00:01:00.600> style<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.050> deck<00:01:01.260> i<00:01:01.469> had<00:01:01.859> some<00:01:01.890> success

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
general style of deck i had some success

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.390 
general style of deck i had some success
with<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> dole<00:01:04.350> marina<00:01:04.500> attack<00:01:05.100> even

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
with you know a dole marina attack even

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.440 
with you know a dole marina attack even
before<00:01:05.549> while<00:01:06.479> nuh<00:01:06.659> Caudill<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.040> unbanned

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
before while nuh Caudill was unbanned

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.820 
before while nuh Caudill was unbanned
but<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.020> sort<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> core<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
but really the sort of core of this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.020 
but really the sort of core of this
second<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> cards<00:01:11.939> are

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
second just a lot of the cards are

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
second just a lot of the cards are
individually<00:01:12.479> very<00:01:12.630> powerful<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> they

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
individually very powerful and they

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.100 
individually very powerful and they
certainly<00:01:14.189> also<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.670> work<00:01:14.760> well<00:01:14.909> together

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
certainly also just work well together

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
certainly also just work well together
cards<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.259> tarmogoyf<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.979> wild<00:01:17.220> mcconnell

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
cards like tarmogoyf in wild mcconnell

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
cards like tarmogoyf in wild mcconnell
just<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> high<00:01:18.060> individual<00:01:18.689> power<00:01:18.930> level

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
just have high individual power level

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.100 
just have high individual power level
much<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.479> contrary<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
much you know to the the contrary of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.499 
much you know to the the contrary of
cards<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.710> lean<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> arbiter<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.390> are

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
cards like lean and arbiter which are

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.690 
cards like lean and arbiter which are
very<00:01:24.689> reliant<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> particular<00:01:26.340> sorts<00:01:26.640> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
very reliant on particular sorts of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.920 
very reliant on particular sorts of
synergies<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.150> order<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:27.689> be

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
synergies in order to actually be

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.090 
synergies in order to actually be
effective<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.430> deck<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
effective so this deck you know has the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.230 
effective so this deck you know has the
ability<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.189> win<00:01:32.430> through<00:01:32.729> sheer<00:01:32.970> card

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ability just win through sheer card

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880 
ability just win through sheer card
power<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> card<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.590> knight<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
power a card like you know knight of the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
power a card like you know knight of the
reliquary<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:36.240> come<00:01:36.450> down<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.920> basically

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
reliquary can come down and basically

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.580 
reliquary can come down and basically
just<00:01:38.130> dominate<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> game<00:01:38.759> by<00:01:38.970> itself<00:01:39.590> because

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
just dominate the game by itself because

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.249 
just dominate the game by itself because
of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.040> sheer<00:01:41.220> power<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.000> card<00:01:42.329> along

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
of the sheer power of that card along

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
of the sheer power of that card along
with<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> synergies<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.670> the

compete<00:05:12.460> with<00:05:12.599> but<00:05:13.599> you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:13.930> just<00:05:14.110> rizal<00:05:14.530> the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
compete with but you can just rizal the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.260 
compete with but you can just rizal the
choke<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.830> they're<00:05:15.310> almost<00:05:15.639> certainly<00:05:16.030> dead

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
choke and they're almost certainly dead

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.800 
choke and they're almost certainly dead
so<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:18.070> other<00:05:18.190> side<00:05:18.580> board<00:05:18.820> changes<00:05:19.449> here

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
so the other side board changes here

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.240 
so the other side board changes here

a deal when you do have stuff like

a deal when you do have stuff like
linvilla<00:05:56.349> that<00:05:56.590> can<00:05:56.680> actually<00:05:56.770> fly<00:05:57.039> over

there<00:05:57.310> guys<00:05:57.430> lindvall<00:05:58.120> is<00:05:58.240> actually<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.539> car

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
there guys lindvall is actually a car

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.020 
there guys lindvall is actually a car
that<00:05:59.199> is<00:05:59.500> shockingly<00:06:00.039> good<00:06:00.250> against<00:06:00.580> affinity

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
that is shockingly good against affinity

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.500 
that is shockingly good against affinity
because<00:06:01.449> their<00:06:01.750> deck<00:06:01.930> is<00:06:02.440> heavily<00:06:02.889> reliant<00:06:03.070> on

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
because their deck is heavily reliant on

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.379 
because their deck is heavily reliant on
the<00:06:04.510> pump<00:06:05.260> effects<00:06:05.650> from<00:06:06.039> both<00:06:06.550> ravager<00:06:07.210> and

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
the pump effects from both ravager and

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.240 
the pump effects from both ravager and
overseer<00:06:08.380> in<00:06:08.680> order<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:08.949> actually<00:06:09.039> the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
overseer in order to actually the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.770 
overseer in order to actually the
effective<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:09.760> has<00:06:09.940> a<00:06:09.970> bunch<00:06:10.180> of<00:06:10.270> small<00:06:10.479> flier

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
effective and has a bunch of small flier

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.300 
effective and has a bunch of small flier
so<00:06:11.080> Lindvall<00:06:11.380> is<00:06:11.500> actually<00:06:11.740> pretty<00:06:11.949> pretty

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
so Lindvall is actually pretty pretty

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.550 
so Lindvall is actually pretty pretty
sweet<00:06:12.580> there<00:06:12.760> it's<00:06:13.449> also<00:06:13.570> clearly<00:06:13.990> excellent

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
sweet there it's also clearly excellent

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.980 
sweet there it's also clearly excellent

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
some eight-player queues assuming we can
