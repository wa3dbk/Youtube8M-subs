a<00:01:39.390> great<00:01:39.810> mechanic<00:01:39.990> right<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.460> we

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a great mechanic right there and here we

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.100 
a great mechanic right there and here we
can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.030> nice<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.750> macro

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
squat Pyrrhic meter we got to see how

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
squat Pyrrhic meter we got to see how
this<00:01:52.110> works<00:01:52.290> out<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.009> end<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:54.000> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
this works out in the end now here you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.940 
this works out in the end now here you
can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.570> course<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.960> rican<00:01:55.409> planning<00:01:55.770> some

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
can see of course a rican planning some

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.030 
can see of course a rican planning some
c4<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.969> tank<00:01:57.210> blowing<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> up<00:01:58.170> after<00:01:58.890> we

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
c4 on this tank blowing it up after we

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520 
c4 on this tank blowing it up after we
have<00:01:59.310> brought<00:02:00.270> down<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> supportive<00:02:01.320> pillar

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
have brought down the supportive pillar

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649 
have brought down the supportive pillar
there<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.820> fast<00:02:03.149> forward<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> little

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
there now it is fast forward a little

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
there now it is fast forward a little
bit<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.799> gameplay<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.729> can

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
bit to this bit of gameplay here we can

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
bit to this bit of gameplay here we can
see<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.299> some<00:02:06.540> sort<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.750> attacking<00:02:07.200> boat

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
see we're in some sort of attacking boat

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.160 
see we're in some sort of attacking boat
and<00:02:07.770> we're<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:08.520> driving<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.509> gunning

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and we're actually driving and gunning

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
and we're actually driving and gunning
at<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> same<00:02:10.679> time<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> 30<00:02:12.209> mil<00:02:12.480> h-hi

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
at the same time so we get a 30 mil h-hi

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
at the same time so we get a 30 mil h-hi
explosive<00:02:13.890> round<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.310> well<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> tow<00:02:14.940> missile

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
now also we can transport three other

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
now also we can transport three other

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
these two tanks that are trying to take

these two tanks that are trying to take
out<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.829> building<00:04:14.280> he's<00:04:15.000> doing<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
out this building he's doing it on a

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.449 
out this building he's doing it on a
tablet<00:04:15.959> which<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.260> little<00:04:16.769> bit<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.040> gimmicky

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
tablet which is a little bit of gimmicky

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.610 
tablet which is a little bit of gimmicky
in<00:04:17.579> my<00:04:17.729> opinion<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.329> do<00:04:19.079> note<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.290> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
in my opinion and do note that the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.380 
in my opinion and do note that the
artillery<00:04:20.070> strike<00:04:20.370> starting<00:04:20.760> position<00:04:21.209> can

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
artillery strike starting position can

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.909 
artillery strike starting position can
probably<00:04:21.720> be<00:04:21.810> taken<00:04:22.080> out<00:04:22.200> by<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.380> enemies<00:04:22.770> so

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
probably be taken out by the enemies so

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.890 
probably be taken out by the enemies so
it's<00:04:23.099> not<00:04:23.310> all<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.729> Opie<00:04:24.120> it's<00:04:24.660> probably

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
it's not all that Opie it's probably

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.629 
it's not all that Opie it's probably
going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.080> be<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.200> same<00:04:25.530> like<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.860> Bal

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
going to be the same like in Bal

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.879 
going to be the same like in Bal
feels<00:04:26.789> too<00:04:27.150> now<00:04:27.719> moving<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.229> I'd<00:04:28.409> like<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.710> draw

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
feels too now moving on I'd like to draw

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.499 
feels too now moving on I'd like to draw
your<00:04:28.919> attention<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.669> mini-map<00:04:30.090> as<00:04:30.330> you

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
your attention to the mini-map as you

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.320 
your attention to the mini-map as you
can<00:04:30.659> see<00:04:30.900> there's<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.169> green<00:04:31.620> line<00:04:31.949> between<00:04:32.849> you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
can see there's a green line between you

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.029 
can see there's a green line between you
and<00:04:33.569> the<00:04:33.840> next<00:04:34.020> flag<00:04:34.289> that's<00:04:34.499> supposed<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.009> be

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
and the next flag that's supposed to be

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.890 
and the next flag that's supposed to be
attacked<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:36.210> think<00:04:36.300> that's<00:04:36.599> a<00:04:36.719> pretty

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
attacked and I think that's a pretty

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.779 
attacked and I think that's a pretty
neat<00:04:37.169> little<00:04:37.379> feature<00:04:37.499> showing<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.340> where<00:04:38.639> to

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
neat little feature showing you where to

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.909 
neat little feature showing you where to
go<00:04:38.939> next<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.659> don't<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.050> search<00:04:40.319> for<00:04:40.680> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
go next you don't have to search for the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.790 
go next you don't have to search for the
markers<00:04:41.729> on<00:04:41.939> the<00:04:42.120> flags<00:04:42.419> on<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.020> hood<00:04:43.199> you<00:04:43.409> can

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
markers on the flags on the hood you can

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.080 
markers on the flags on the hood you can
actually<00:04:43.949> just<00:04:44.129> take<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.520> look<00:04:44.789> at<00:04:44.909> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
actually just take a look at the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.480 
actually just take a look at the
mini-map<00:04:45.449> and<00:04:45.659> there<00:04:46.050> you<00:04:46.229> go<00:04:46.259> now<00:04:47.129> if<00:04:47.249> you<00:04:47.340> pay

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
mini-map and there you go now if you pay

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.249 
mini-map and there you go now if you pay
closer<00:04:47.789> attention<00:04:47.909> to<00:04:48.360> center<00:04:48.689> is<00:04:48.870> about<00:04:49.080> to

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
closer attention to center is about to

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.920 
closer attention to center is about to
stab<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:49.740> guy<00:04:49.860> in<00:04:50.189> a<00:04:50.400> pretty<00:04:50.789> wicked<00:04:51.330> way<00:04:51.569> if

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
stab this guy in a pretty wicked way if

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.959 
stab this guy in a pretty wicked way if
you<00:04:52.349> take<00:04:52.529> a<00:04:52.560> look<00:04:52.770> at<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.129> sea<00:04:53.400> market<00:04:53.789> it's

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
you take a look at the sea market it's

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.119 
you take a look at the sea market it's
about<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.479> disappear<00:04:55.020> once<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.740> building<00:04:55.889> is

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
about to disappear once the building is

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.820 
about to disappear once the building is
actually<00:04:56.430> collapsing<00:04:57.389> now<00:04:58.020> also<00:04:58.229> pretty<00:04:58.590> nice

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
actually collapsing now also pretty nice

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.860 
actually collapsing now also pretty nice
here<00:04:59.069> you<00:04:59.189> can<00:04:59.370> see<00:04:59.550> there's<00:04:59.759> animation<00:05:00.449> for

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
here you can see there's animation for

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.390 
here you can see there's animation for
pulling<00:05:01.199> your<00:05:01.319> shoot<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:02.009> it's<00:05:02.219> no<00:05:02.370> longer

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
pulling your shoot so it's no longer

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.610 
pulling your shoot so it's no longer
just<00:05:02.759> as<00:05:03.150> zap<00:05:03.509> and<00:05:03.719> the<00:05:03.990> shoots<00:05:04.199> out<00:05:04.379> you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
just as zap and the shoots out you

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.800 
just as zap and the shoots out you
actually<00:05:04.949> have<00:05:05.099> to<00:05:05.279> pull<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.240> chute<00:05:06.419> if<00:05:06.629> your

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
actually have to pull the chute if your

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.269 
actually have to pull the chute if your
right<00:05:06.990> hand<00:05:07.319> which<00:05:07.529> is<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.680> pretty<00:05:07.979> nifty

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:08.279 
right hand which is a pretty nifty

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.309 
right hand which is a pretty nifty
detail<00:05:08.789> that<00:05:09.000> they<00:05:09.120> included<00:05:09.539> into<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> game

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
detail that they included into the game

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.320 
detail that they included into the game
now<00:05:11.039> here<00:05:11.189> of<00:05:11.310> course<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.699> see<00:05:11.909> the<00:05:11.939> building

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
now here of course is see the building

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.149 
now here of course is see the building
collapse<00:05:12.689> and<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.229> think<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:13.919> have<00:05:14.039> been

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
collapse and I think it would have been

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.010 
collapse and I think it would have been
awesome<00:05:14.370> if<00:05:14.909> the<00:05:15.000> chopper<00:05:15.419> would<00:05:15.599> actually

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
awesome if the chopper would actually

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.749 
awesome if the chopper would actually
get<00:05:16.169> crushed<00:05:16.590> underneath<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.189> building<00:05:17.340> but

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
get crushed underneath the building but

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.360 
get crushed underneath the building but
whatever<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:19.379> this<00:05:19.560> screen<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:20.099> see

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
whatever and in this screen you can see

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.219 
whatever and in this screen you can see
once<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:21.029> building<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.360> being<00:05:21.569> collapsed<00:05:22.110> you

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
once the building is being collapsed you

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.200 
once the building is being collapsed you
can<00:05:22.379> see<00:05:22.589> the<00:05:22.710> sea<00:05:22.949> flag<00:05:23.219> reappear<00:05:23.909> in<00:05:24.060> the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
can see the sea flag reappear in the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.510 
can see the sea flag reappear in the
rubble<00:05:24.599> so<00:05:25.080> that's<00:05:25.349> a<00:05:25.529> pretty<00:05:25.800> nice<00:05:26.099> detail

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
rubble so that's a pretty nice detail

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.170 
rubble so that's a pretty nice detail
there<00:05:26.789> as<00:05:26.969> well<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:28.430> as<00:05:29.430> if<00:05:29.639> collapse<00:05:29.999> and

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
there as well and as if collapse and

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.429 
there as well and as if collapse and
buildings<00:05:30.449> weren't<00:05:30.599> cool<00:05:30.839> enough<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.259> can

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
buildings weren't cool enough you can

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.939 
buildings weren't cool enough you can
also<00:05:31.680> now<00:05:31.949> counter-attack<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:32.969> knife<00:05:33.419> kill

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949

medic and supporting this picture which
leaves<00:05:39.930> us<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.379> be<00:05:40.560> probably<00:05:41.039> roly-poly

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
leaves us to be probably roly-poly

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.329

visions<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:32.639> not<00:06:32.819> just<00:06:33.000> nerve<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.389> into

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
visions and not just nerve it into

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.040 
visions and not just nerve it into
oblivious<00:06:34.020> like<00:06:34.500> they<00:06:34.649> did<00:06:34.830> in<00:06:34.949> battlefield<00:06:35.669> 3

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
oblivious like they did in battlefield 3

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.449 
oblivious like they did in battlefield 3
also<00:06:37.050> I've<00:06:37.199> noticed<00:06:37.589> that<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.860> song<00:06:38.069> is<00:06:38.099> never

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:38.459 
also I've noticed that the song is never

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:40.190 
also I've noticed that the song is never
shine<00:06:38.789> into<00:06:39.060> our<00:06:39.180> face<00:06:39.479> during<00:06:39.750> the<00:06:39.930> whole

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
shine into our face during the whole

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.070 
shine into our face during the whole
of<00:06:40.260> this<00:06:40.410> presentation<00:06:41.210> now<00:06:42.210> again<00:06:42.600> look<00:06:42.990> at

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
of this presentation now again look at

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.050 
of this presentation now again look at
the<00:06:43.170> glass<00:06:43.410> it<00:06:43.950> just<00:06:44.220> looks<00:06:44.430> fucking

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
the glass it just looks fucking

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.410 
the glass it just looks fucking
fantastic<00:06:45.710> now<00:06:46.710> regarding<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.550> Sun<00:06:47.790> I'm<00:06:48.030> not

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
fantastic now regarding the Sun I'm not

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.030 
fantastic now regarding the Sun I'm not
quite<00:06:48.570> sure<00:06:48.600> maybe<00:06:49.050> they've<00:06:49.350> nerved<00:06:49.620> it<00:06:49.830> maybe

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
quite sure maybe they've nerved it maybe

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.890 
quite sure maybe they've nerved it maybe
not<00:06:50.280> we<00:06:50.760> probably<00:06:50.970> have<00:06:51.210> to<00:06:51.330> see<00:06:51.540> how<00:06:51.750> this

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
not we probably have to see how this

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.260 
not we probably have to see how this
pans<00:06:52.110> out<00:06:52.320> in<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:52.680> full<00:06:52.920> game<00:06:53.160> now<00:06:53.850> in<00:06:54.000> the<00:06:54.060> top

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
pans out in the full game now in the top

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.240 
pans out in the full game now in the top
right<00:06:54.480> corner<00:06:54.630> we<00:06:54.870> can<00:06:55.050> see<00:06:55.260> back<00:06:55.530> space<00:06:55.890> for

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
right corner we can see back space for

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.340 
right corner we can see back space for
Battlelog<00:06:56.700> and<00:06:57.060> I'm<00:06:57.630> not<00:06:57.810> quite<00:06:57.960> sure<00:06:57.990> if<00:06:58.110> this

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
Battlelog and I'm not quite sure if this

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.560 
Battlelog and I'm not quite sure if this
means<00:06:58.650> in<00:06:58.860> Game<00:06:59.220> integration<00:06:59.820> of<00:06:59.880> bad<00:07:00.090> luck<00:07:00.330> or

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
means in Game integration of bad luck or

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.270 
means in Game integration of bad luck or
in<00:07:00.750> game<00:07:00.930> server<00:07:01.200> browser<00:07:01.410> they<00:07:02.130> haven't

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
in game server browser they haven't

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.070 
in game server browser they haven't
talked<00:07:02.610> about<00:07:02.850> this<00:07:03.030> at<00:07:03.240> all<00:07:03.330> so<00:07:03.630> I<00:07:03.660> don't<00:07:03.990> know

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
talked about this at all so I don't know

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.040 
talked about this at all so I don't know
if<00:07:04.110> that's<00:07:04.410> going<00:07:04.590> to<00:07:04.650> be<00:07:04.770> in<00:07:04.950> the<00:07:05.190> game<00:07:05.400> or<00:07:05.640> not

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
if that's going to be in the game or not

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.600 
if that's going to be in the game or not
now<00:07:07.050> before<00:07:07.410> I<00:07:07.590> wrap<00:07:07.860> up<00:07:08.010> the<00:07:08.190> video<00:07:08.430> I'd<00:07:08.580> like

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
now before I wrap up the video I'd like

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.400 
now before I wrap up the video I'd like
to<00:07:08.790> talk<00:07:09.090> a<00:07:09.120> little<00:07:09.420> bit<00:07:09.600> about<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.900> scrappers

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
to talk a little bit about the scrappers

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.740 
to talk a little bit about the scrappers
we<00:07:10.920> can<00:07:11.100> see<00:07:11.250> we<00:07:11.370> could<00:07:11.520> scratch<00:07:11.790> sprint<00:07:12.210> squad

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
we can see we could scratch sprint squad

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.110 
we can see we could scratch sprint squad
ammo<00:07:13.050> and<00:07:13.260> squad<00:07:13.560> frag<00:07:13.920> and<00:07:14.130> the<00:07:14.490> last<00:07:14.730> of<00:07:14.970> them

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
ammo and squad frag and the last of them

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.030 
ammo and squad frag and the last of them
is<00:07:15.380> probably<00:07:16.380> something<00:07:16.680> to<00:07:16.830> do<00:07:17.010> with

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
is probably something to do with

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.190 
is probably something to do with
suppression<00:07:18.000> now<00:07:18.660> here<00:07:18.900> you<00:07:18.930> see<00:07:19.080> the

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
suppression now here you see the

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.750 
suppression now here you see the
engineer<00:07:19.710> jumping<00:07:20.130> down<00:07:20.250> in<00:07:20.460> front<00:07:20.580> of<00:07:20.700> the

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
engineer jumping down in front of the

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.340 
engineer jumping down in front of the
skyscraper<00:07:20.970> you<00:07:21.360> can<00:07:21.540> see<00:07:21.780> actually<00:07:21.960> a

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
skyscraper you can see actually a

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.200 
skyscraper you can see actually a
distance<00:07:22.890> mark<00:07:23.130> on<00:07:23.310> it<00:07:23.400> that's<00:07:23.610> a<00:07:23.760> pretty<00:07:23.970> neat

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
distance mark on it that's a pretty neat

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.510 
distance mark on it that's a pretty neat
detail<00:07:24.600> as<00:07:24.780> well<00:07:25.080> so<00:07:25.830> that<00:07:25.860> wraps<00:07:26.190> it<00:07:26.370> up<00:07:26.460> for

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
detail as well so that wraps it up for

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.580 
detail as well so that wraps it up for
