 despite being very cold in this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 period the Brazilians apart from playing 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.269
 in europe they are used to the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.120
 low temperature and is favorite as well 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.739
 it's about brazil and it's about dunga 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 that has a very good looking challenge 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 with Brazilian team and mainly 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.479
 in copa america his first title with 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.280
 Brazil was America's Cup 2007 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.530
 the redoubt that is in the stage of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.589
 spare parts had an investment of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 approximately 300 million pesos a 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.609
 world-wide enclosure that was cataloged 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.160
 as simple but modern by the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.030
 social communicators from the country of 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.610
 samba is a simple stadium but I 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.250
 it seems very useful for everything has 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.340
 structure mainly for jobs 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.590
 of press the modern structure a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 stadium that are molded and modernized makes 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.670
 little time 2008 I think for Brazil 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
 play here will be very good will not have 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.850
 structure problems us 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.320
 we hope on May 30 are delivering 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.130
 officially to the juice federation 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 Chile 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.490
 the park stadium grounds 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.929
 and we have details details that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.359
 they are basically outside the 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.310
 enclosure that are the term of the 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.390
 training that the anthropologist and a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.189
 Rain water project in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 integration of children's games together 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 with which the Brazilians know the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.130
 sports venue where three will be played 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.509
 Copa America matches the trip 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.189
 It also aims that the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.159
 journalists can visit the destinations 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.929
 tourist attractions of araucanÃ­a 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.299
 we have a group that is composed of 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.789
 sports journalists and journalists 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.500
 means of tourism where they will be able to 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.649
 share a little bit of experience and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.720
 Bring to Brazil what attractions you have 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.289
 chili to wait for them not only in what 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.450
 sports but also knowing the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 tourist destinations of our country 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.329
 representatives of the delegation 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.970
 they predicted that the final will be between 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.340
 Chile and Brazil a prediction that could 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.860
 remember is important meeting in the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.810
 eighth finals between both teams of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.870
 world past played on land 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.190
 I think that the final that 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.170
 everyone wanted to be Chile against Brazil 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.329
 We think that Brazil is doing well in 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.880
 that competition because it came down from dunga 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.750
 as 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.150
 coach is very firm has made good 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.650
 work in its interior passage 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.330
 we think that precise is going to advance the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.940
 Chile also because I have it is 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.280
 injured one month after the start of the cup 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.840
 america the german becker stadium already 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.780
 prepare for different encounters 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.730
 football fans where more than 18,000 fans 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.800
 they will enjoy every peace and every goal 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.080
 that is played in these fields of 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.080
 municipal stadium of the regional capital
