00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.680
 good here we have a santero a sample 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.900
 of tablet s with processors and media in 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.570
 this case you are using a 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.599
 processor that is called apec or is a 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.609
 701 heterogeneous processor but we're 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.200
 hoping to have a great presence in 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 the next months in the next year 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.000
 in what is the tablet market the pc 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.620
 the difference between tablet and tam in tc 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's just the operating system that 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.280
 we are with windows 8 but our 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 windows 8 retainer but windows 8 but 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 the windows 8 desktop that is that the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.589
 people use on their new computer 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.359
 of normal desktop then 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.160
 allowing to use any type of 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.649
 application that one ran windows xp 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.050
 Windows Vista can run Windows 7 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.710
 in this type of tablet 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.149
 this is a know as I say is a 3 before 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.559
 of engineering serves nothing more than to 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.379
 be able to test the software on how it 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.649
 it involves the equipment but the good thing about this 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.320
 is that you can see if the speed of 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.440
 movement and cycle response 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.720
 creative is fantastic and also because 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.280
 example consider the text 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
 You can run good as we 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 mentioned applications that were only 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.890
 reserved to hide the desktop or 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.680
 mobiles of high bearing as is how it is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.140
 a notebook with buyers of oils 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 from aymerich 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.560
 this we hope it is one of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.930
 the big markets next year 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.610
 that really gives you a flexibility of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 the person at the end of the sense 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.140
 of I want to use a full photoshop of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.760
 desktop inside your tablet and it's going to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 can do wants to use for example the 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.119
 which has the famous system of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.509
 tango billing wants to use by 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.440
 example a previous office or the open 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.390
 office and want to navigate in the most 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.030
 possible fluid in this type tablet is going 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.470
 to be able to do until we have certain 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.289
 business certain projects with companies 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.869
 corporate who want to use the 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.180
 tablet for example using the coach 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.280
 and now the detainees are going to show 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.709
 and going through different areas showing 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 the engineering design the design of a 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.510
 motor of a machine in functional form 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 we leave a score of another game 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.540
 for desks and they end up in a genius 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.140
 has a particular broad and so 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.299
 we hope that those who come here will come 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.640
 has a mini hdmi and we can connect it 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.360
 to the law of our house in hdmi and play 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.360
 in 720 p we connect 2 optical usb type 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.850
 xbox and we can play the ford in one 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.930
 wing and the eventual fifa of the tablet 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.930
 on our desktop 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.990
 we are in open play without problems 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.710
 the team keeps responding let's see 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.630
 if we have it connected 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.650
 we have everything we know about 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.390
 windows 8 today but with strong rapidity 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.430
 we can also see him 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.980
 let's see 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.079
 ownership of the system that we have in 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.269
 this case we have that this is 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.920
 One is the main differentiator that 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.680
 we are going to have in what stable mark what 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.120
 new is to be able to support videos of 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.879
 desk now we have one tells me 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.879
 it's 01 from michigan we just 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.459
 launch the z 60 processor that is with the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.870
 that many different brands are going to come 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.819
 of tablet products technology with 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.650
 with the 760 the main difference with 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.620
 the crystal in this samper here is 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.659
 mainly the electricity consumption is 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.230
 significantly reduces this suppressor 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.950
 of about 6.9 got and 760 of 4.9 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.659
 bots 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.069
 but in the use of a navigation by 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.439
 internet for example on page made in 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.230
 2005 and others still the consumption is much 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.139
 less than this because it is handled in a 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.000
 smarter use of gpu and being 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.829
 little remember that this is an app that 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.079
 it's not just a CPU here in architecture 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.579
 heterogeneous and that's why fluency the 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.639
 speed with which it allows you with this 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.930
 this is not a CPU processor of your 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.940
 work 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.270
 of resources and commitment as in 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.449
 the market this is a single 2 gb without 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.820
 However the expectation of windows 8 64 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.680
 ie bits here we have architecture 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.780
 64 bits we know that the tablets come 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.190
 with teachers of a weapon design that are 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.360
 all 32 bits so if we want you 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.039
 get memory what we are going to do 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.509
 some expectations about 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.949
 Product availability of this 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.350
 style maybe not of reference but of 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.729
 other brands for 2013 if we 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.830
 we are waiting for worldwide in 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.050
 the next two months two and a half months 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.750
 We are not talking about January and March 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.280
 It will be an important line of that place 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.370
 as we are the different models 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.220
 of the main companies that manufacture 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.380
 for example notebooks already within very 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.690
 little hope we do not have to go back to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.380
 the office is also but if within 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.820
 very little 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.430
 availability we are already 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.560
 driving internally is talking in 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.949
 the projects with these companies or in 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.229
 there is a specific product in the 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.580
 market no 160 that of fujitsu that is 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.349
 more than anything oriented to the market 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.120
 corporate this kind of tablet 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.260
 really for the corporate market is 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.940
 the best 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.190
 is what can really get to 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.980
 serve for example in what it says it is 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.990
 the future of one laptop plans per 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.660
 child or as it is called a channel that has 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.760
 Connect equality 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.300
 where you want to replace the one in the 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.120
 netbook by 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.879
 by tablet for guys a guy 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.349
 of product like this one would follow 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.060
 when you are driving something extra 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.680
 that 3 because originally this saint 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.729
 it came with windows 7 that we know not 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.550
 he is very prepared for the touch 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.669
 then I brought you strict this touch 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.560
 pad just another with just to be able 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.539
 handle it as if we were however 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.629
 in windows 8 already comes super prepared 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.500
 to take advantage of this and thus put 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:06.419
 opening the different applications 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.530
 here we see how we are running 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.330
 really the overflow of not watching a video 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.210
 or nothing strange just the game 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:17.169
 running in real life we are 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.349
 playing at this moment playing here 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.349
 in 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:26.440
 how it works is important of the 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.969
 games here in particular is what is the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.880
 application ok you sent today in the 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:34.710
 application hereinafter 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.860
 exactly the powders in the cpu though 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.270
 every time obviously 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:45.610
 with more importance and more priority 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.610
 because I chose this revolver 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.290
 let's consider it's still not running 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.880
 at 60 frames per second complete the 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.440
 fact that he's just running already 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.169
 it is quite important 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:02.510
 yes yes but playable but it is totally 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.250
 playable and visits with friends with three 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.470
 more friends play this game directly 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.930
 on the tablet nothing else you can 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.690
 play quietly before the defeat of 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.400
 take the lead which a while ago 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.870
 if you carry a notebook for example 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.030
 our last generation what is 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.040
 flame would be that it is also a machine 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.870
 gamer and we have made networks to be 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.870
 married and write 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.840
 what is called the call of duty black 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:33.000
 ops' 1 and without a problem 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.000
 so good that's already 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
 48 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.620
 but well there I have companions and 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.620
 I really went
