00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.800 

right<00:01:41.170> there<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.980> in<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:42.970> lovely<00:01:43.659> little

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
right there and in this lovely little

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.120 
right there and in this lovely little
room<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.750> where<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.050> crash<00:01:47.470> last<00:01:47.770> night<00:01:50.130> so

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
room it's where we crash last night so

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.260 
room it's where we crash last night so
it<00:01:51.310> looked<00:01:51.490> like<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.820> was<00:01:51.970> something<00:01:52.090> about

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
it looked like it was something about

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.570 
it looked like it was something about
like<00:01:52.540> base<00:01:53.110> camp<00:01:53.440> for<00:01:53.530> skiers<00:01:54.130> or<00:01:54.310> something

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
like base camp for skiers or something

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.999 
like base camp for skiers or something
like<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:57.479> guess<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.590> is<00:01:59.800> really

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
like that but I guess this is really

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.760 
like that but I guess this is really
just<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.520> place<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.090> deportees<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.410> police
