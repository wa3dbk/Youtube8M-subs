you check out my other video that i did

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
on this way and this way the 16 inches

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.350 
on this way and this way the 16 inches
in<00:04:46.930> case<00:04:47.080> anybody<00:04:47.500> was<00:04:47.650> wondering<00:04:48.190> um<00:04:48.490> and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
in case anybody was wondering um and

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.510 
in case anybody was wondering um and
they<00:04:49.630> charge<00:04:51.900> pretty<00:04:52.900> pretty<00:04:53.560> high<00:04:54.010> gap

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
between the lines so it's probably would

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.570 
between the lines so it's probably would
