00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.160 
a part of the show and then sometimes
your<00:02:28.060> questioning<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.930> something

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170

that<00:02:33.940> line<00:02:34.270> between<00:02:34.570> what's<00:02:34.960> reality<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
that line between what's reality and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.590 
that line between what's reality and
what's<00:02:36.130> show<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.670> making<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.390> all
