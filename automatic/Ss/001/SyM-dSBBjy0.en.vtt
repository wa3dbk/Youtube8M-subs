story

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.910 

the<00:01:51.330> reason<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.780> did<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> leveling<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the reason I did the leveling up is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
the reason I did the leveling up is
because<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.810> next<00:01:55.140> dension<00:01:55.560> we're<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.980> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
because the next dension we're going to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
because the next dension we're going to
go<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.730> really<00:01:57.420> hard<00:01:57.720> really<00:01:58.440> long<00:02:00.320> last

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
go to is really hard really long last

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.850 
go to is really hard really long last
