00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
indentations you'll see them a screw

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.690 
indentations you'll see them a screw
dough<00:00:52.809> won't<00:00:53.020> fit<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.410> here<00:00:53.800> but<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.280> will<00:00:54.370> slot

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
dough won't fit in here but it will slot

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.229 
dough won't fit in here but it will slot
in<00:00:54.850> there

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
in there

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.360 
in there
and<00:00:56.280> basically<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.500> positioning<00:01:00.100> of<00:01:00.250> a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
and basically that is a positioning of a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.540 
and basically that is a positioning of a
clip<00:01:00.700> which<00:01:01.390> connects<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.350> body<00:01:02.590> just<00:01:02.890> by

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
clip which connects to the body just by

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.760 
clip which connects to the body just by
force<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.299> sort<00:01:04.539> of<00:01:04.570> pushes<00:01:04.809> back<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.379> it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
force so it sort of pushes back and it's

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.949 
force so it sort of pushes back and it's
got<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> hook<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:07.240> that's<00:01:07.389> what<00:01:07.539> stops<00:01:07.810> it

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:07.959 
got a hook and that's what stops it

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:09.179 
got a hook and that's what stops it

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
the units we dealt with with a lot of

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.620 
the units we dealt with with a lot of
units<00:01:35.649> you<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.369> run<00:01:36.909> your<00:01:37.029> hand<00:01:37.270> underneath

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
units you just run your hand underneath

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.230 
units you just run your hand underneath
and<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.319> can<00:01:38.469> actually<00:01:38.859> pull<00:01:39.490> up<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
and you can actually pull up this and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.379 
and you can actually pull up this and
it's<00:01:44.229> fairly<00:01:44.529> easy<00:01:44.679> when<00:01:45.549> you<00:01:45.639> get<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.939> here<00:01:46.239> on

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
it's fairly easy when you get to here on

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.409 
it's fairly easy when you get to here on
here<00:01:46.779> it<00:01:47.409> tends<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:47.739> get<00:01:47.889> stuck<00:01:47.999> but<00:01:48.999> you<00:01:49.239> can

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:49.419 
here it tends to get stuck but you can

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:51.239 
here it tends to get stuck but you can
you<00:01:49.899> can<00:01:50.049> pull<00:01:50.229> up<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.679> less<00:01:50.859> if<00:01:51.099> it's

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
you can pull up and the less if it's

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.969 
you can pull up and the less if it's
really<00:01:51.639> tight<00:01:51.849> like<00:01:51.880> now<00:01:52.529> that<00:01:53.529> will<00:01:53.739> come<00:01:53.950> up

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
really tight like now that will come up

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.789 
really tight like now that will come up

don't<00:04:08.290> lose<00:04:08.439> them<00:04:09.389> cuz<00:04:10.389> that<00:04:10.599> would<00:04:10.719> be<00:04:10.870> silly

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
don't lose them cuz that would be silly

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.740 
don't lose them cuz that would be silly

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
with them is that this cover you need to

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.640 
with them is that this cover you need to
slide<00:04:20.199> it<00:04:20.380> forward<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.699> lift<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.650> slide

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
slide it forward so lift up and slide

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.560 
slide it forward so lift up and slide
forward<00:04:24.070> there<00:04:25.030> we<00:04:25.150> go

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
forward there we go

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.540 
forward there we go
and<00:04:26.440> tada<00:04:27.639> there<00:04:27.789> is<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> battery<00:04:29.430> under<00:04:30.430> this

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
and tada there is the battery under this

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.770 
and tada there is the battery under this
plate<00:04:30.789> that's<00:04:31.030> all<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.330> is

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
plate that's all that is

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.510 
plate that's all that is
but<00:04:32.259> with<00:04:32.380> hooks<00:04:32.590> on<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.830> bottom<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.340> your

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
but with hooks on the bottom is your

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.499 
but with hooks on the bottom is your
note<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:34.300> those<00:04:34.599> hook<00:04:35.380> into<00:04:35.800> those<00:04:36.509> capsule

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
note and those hook into those capsule

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.279 
note and those hook into those capsule
there<00:04:37.690> now<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.710> battery<00:04:39.220> as<00:04:39.430> standard<00:04:40.289> you

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
there now this battery as standard you

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.010 
there now this battery as standard you
will<00:04:41.410> see<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:41.770> got<00:04:41.919> sticky<00:04:42.250> back<00:04:42.690> tape<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:43.900> it

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
will see it's got sticky back tape on it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.089 
will see it's got sticky back tape on it
essentially<00:04:44.620> but<00:04:44.800> it's<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:44.979> foam<00:04:45.220> pad<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.770> can

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
essentially but it's a foam pad you can

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.279 
essentially but it's a foam pad you can
stick<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.669> down<00:04:48.940> as<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.660> can<00:04:49.810> see<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.110> just

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
stick this down as you can see this just

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.920 
stick this down as you can see this just
removes<00:04:50.740> now<00:04:50.979> it's<00:04:51.280> not<00:04:51.430> stuck<00:04:51.789> but<00:04:52.599> believe

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
removes now it's not stuck but believe

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.320 
removes now it's not stuck but believe
it<00:04:53.080> or<00:04:53.139> not<00:04:53.349> from<00:04:54.280> our<00:04:54.460> experience<00:04:55.120> you

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
it or not from our experience you

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.020 
it or not from our experience you
actually<00:04:55.690> came<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.440> more<00:04:56.650> squeaking<00:04:57.310> if<00:04:57.669> you

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
actually came to a more squeaking if you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.879 
actually came to a more squeaking if you
do<00:04:58.270> if<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.930> position<00:04:59.289> it<00:04:59.349> slightly<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.860> the

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
do if you position it slightly to the

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.620 
do if you position it slightly to the
left<00:05:00.159> or<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.520> right<00:05:00.610> or<00:05:00.970> even<00:05:01.240> slightly<00:05:01.479> up

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
left or to the right or even slightly up

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.200 
left or to the right or even slightly up
or<00:05:01.780> down<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.949> can<00:05:03.190> rub<00:05:03.430> against<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.880> side

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
or down it can rub against the side

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.830 
or down it can rub against the side
panel<00:05:04.800> making<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.889> noise<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:07.030> you<00:05:07.510> don't

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
panel making a noise and you don't

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.390 
panel making a noise and you don't
really<00:05:08.020> get<00:05:08.169> any<00:05:08.320> rattles<00:05:08.650> if<00:05:09.039> you've<00:05:09.190> seen

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
really get any rattles if you've seen

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.740 
really get any rattles if you've seen
the<00:05:09.490> previous<00:05:09.669> stunt<00:05:10.060> video<00:05:10.240> we've<00:05:10.539> done

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
the previous stunt video we've done

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.810 
the previous stunt video we've done
jumping<00:05:11.650> off<00:05:11.770> pallets<00:05:12.159> and<00:05:12.280> things<00:05:12.520> this

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
jumping off pallets and things this

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.939 
jumping off pallets and things this
thing<00:05:13.060> isn't<00:05:13.210> getting<00:05:13.510> thrown<00:05:13.750> about<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.500> does

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
thing isn't getting thrown about it does

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.830 
thing isn't getting thrown about it does
fit<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.310> there<00:05:15.460> quite<00:05:15.729> snugly<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.479> this<00:05:16.690> is

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
fit in there quite snugly and this is

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.050 
fit in there quite snugly and this is
designed<00:05:17.229> really<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.800> try<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.550> take<00:05:18.729> some<00:05:18.970> of

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
designed really to try and take some of

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.689 
designed really to try and take some of
the<00:05:19.120> vibration<00:05:19.720> out<00:05:19.830> but<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:20.919> can<00:05:21.220> stick<00:05:21.580> if

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
the vibration out but you can stick if

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.850 
the vibration out but you can stick if
you<00:05:21.759> want<00:05:22.030> we'd<00:05:22.659> recommend<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.470> leave<00:05:23.620> it<00:05:23.770> as

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
you want we'd recommend just leave it as

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.040 
you want we'd recommend just leave it as
it<00:05:24.009> is<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.789> sits<00:05:25.090> in<00:05:25.240> there<00:05:25.330> quite<00:05:25.539> nicely<00:05:25.599> as

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
it is it sits in there quite nicely as

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.189 
it is it sits in there quite nicely as
factory<00:05:26.500> condition<00:05:27.220> just<00:05:27.880> as<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.150> is<00:05:28.300> now<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
factory condition just as it is now the

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.879 
factory condition just as it is now the
battery<00:05:29.820> has<00:05:30.820> got<00:05:31.120> two<00:05:31.810> connectors<00:05:32.229> you've

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
battery has got two connectors you've

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.490 
battery has got two connectors you've
got<00:05:33.130> this<00:05:33.280> one<00:05:33.460> here<00:05:33.729> and<00:05:34.199> you've<00:05:35.199> got<00:05:35.229> this

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
got this one here and you've got this

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.249 
got this one here and you've got this
one<00:05:35.710> here<00:05:35.979> and<00:05:36.520> on<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.699> top<00:05:36.789> of<00:05:36.940> this<00:05:37.120> one<00:05:37.330> you

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
one here and on the top of this one you

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.129 
one here and on the top of this one you
will<00:05:38.380> see<00:05:38.650> a<00:05:38.919> little<00:05:39.820> lever<00:05:40.090> and<00:05:40.509> all<00:05:40.810> you<00:05:40.990> do

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
will see a little lever and all you do

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.540 
will see a little lever and all you do
is<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.979> pull<00:05:42.159> that<00:05:42.310> down<00:05:42.370> and<00:05:42.880> it<00:05:43.000> lifts<00:05:43.419> up

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
is you pull that down and it lifts up

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.850 
is you pull that down and it lifts up
basically<00:05:45.550> lifts<00:05:46.000> up<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.330> little<00:05:46.810> arm<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.770> you

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
basically lifts up a little arm and you

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.300 
basically lifts up a little arm and you
just<00:05:47.979> pull<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.220> out<00:05:48.490> that's<00:05:49.330> disconnected

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
just pull that out that's disconnected

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.909 
just pull that out that's disconnected
with<00:05:51.310> this<00:05:51.490> one<00:05:51.699> there<00:05:52.509> is<00:05:52.690> no<00:05:52.840> lever<00:05:53.050> so<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
with this one there is no lever so you

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.839 
with this one there is no lever so you
just<00:05:54.190> simply<00:05:54.509> pull<00:05:55.509> that<00:05:55.720> connector<00:05:56.020> out<00:05:56.849> that

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
just simply pull that connector out that

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.170 
just simply pull that connector out that
is<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.180> battery<00:05:59.760> disconnected

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
is the battery disconnected

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.719 
is the battery disconnected
and<00:06:02.300> there's<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.440> connectors<00:06:03.919> if<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:04.550> want

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
and there's the connectors if you want

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.540 
and there's the connectors if you want
to<00:06:04.789> be<00:06:04.880> sure<00:06:05.060> what<00:06:05.240> they<00:06:05.330> look<00:06:05.539> like<00:06:06.340> simple<00:06:07.340> as
