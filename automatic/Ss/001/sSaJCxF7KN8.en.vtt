00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 one of our athletes will be 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 master of sports and the champion of Europe but 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.470

 to attract young people and a passionate guitar 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.520

 local competition organizers 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 stay true to themselves this time too 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 if last year the route ran along 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 relatively flat top of the sapun mount 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.020
 then this time the herd was put on 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.059
 maxim cottage 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 a continuation of the western slope 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.590
 Breather mountains appeared an element of the mountain race 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.030
 with ups and downs from year to year 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.129
 the meeting is getting bigger 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 many cities of the Crimea and other areas

 Ukraine for adult athletes special 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 labor was not to overcome all 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 distance in the saddle novice riders without 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.579
 special confusion passed from driving 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.960
 write and run where the path 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.370
 it became very cool 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 parents and teammates 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 supported the athletes at the stone we 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.970
 decided to raise the bar a little bit 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.170
 Maxim giving more difficult more interesting 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.409
 more varied than those breather race 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 which was carried out over the past 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.570
 two years that is they were enough 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.030
 flat even now we decided to add 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.930
 small ups and downs that is 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.539
 diversity 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.380
 same time make more interesting tracks 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.479
 During the year there are two stages: 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.750
 traditionally in June in the district celebration 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.030

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.990
 competition quite successfully put and 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.179

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.100
 prize winners there were no losers riding by 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.500
 rough terrain with friends 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.569
 excellent waters for both schoolchildren and for their 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.310
 parents clean air of pine forests 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.530
 moderate but regular physical 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.270
 load has a beneficial effect on 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.729
 health of children and for parents 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.840
 extra incentive and yourself leave from 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.819
 age-related diseases

 mountain bike federation does 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.630
 big deal but that's just help 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.730
 effective yet nobody gets 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.739
 with rare exceptions, the next meeting 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.720
 mountain bikers take place in autumn 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.920
 when the heat subsides and until school 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.599

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.360
