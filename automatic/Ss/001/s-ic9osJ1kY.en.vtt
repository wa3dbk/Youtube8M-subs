by Wednesday is that going to give you
enough<00:01:23.869> time<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.170> think<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.560> kind<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.070> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
enough time you think to kind of get the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.060 
enough time you think to kind of get the
maybe<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.090> rust<00:01:26.270> off<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.869> think<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.009> know

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
maybe the rust off I think so you know

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.230 
maybe the rust off I think so you know
what's<00:01:28.250> what's<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.549> hardest<00:01:28.850> part<00:01:28.939> for<00:01:29.119> a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
what's what's the hardest part for a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.230 
what's what's the hardest part for a
kicker<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.950> getting<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:31.280> routine<00:01:31.700> routine

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
kicker just getting that routine routine

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.109 
kicker just getting that routine routine
down<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.899> get<00:01:33.049> into<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.969> timing<00:01:34.969> is

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
down that you get into and timing is

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.810 
down that you get into and timing is
crucial<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:35.750> us<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:37.130> I've<00:01:37.219> been<00:01:37.310> doing<00:01:37.369> type

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
crucial for us so I've been doing type

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.910 
crucial for us so I've been doing type
like<00:01:38.060> drills<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:39.049> what<00:01:39.500> Danny<00:01:39.710> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
like drills with what Danny and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.709 
like drills with what Danny and
Christian<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.490> make<00:01:41.119> sure<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.509> I'm<00:01:41.689> not

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
Christian to make sure that I'm not

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.109 
Christian to make sure that I'm not
gonna<00:01:41.929> lose<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.229> timing

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
gonna lose that timing

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.190 
gonna lose that timing
so<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.110> mean<00:01:46.500> should<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.280> fine<00:01:47.460> by<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:48.200> last

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so it I mean should be fine by one last

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
so it I mean should be fine by one last
thing<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.520> an<00:01:50.640> injury

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
like this obviously if this was a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.300 
like this obviously if this was a
freshman<00:01:53.880> maybe<00:01:54.060> you'd<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.330> concerned<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:55.770> guy

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
freshman maybe you'd be concerned a guy

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
freshman maybe you'd be concerned a guy
your<00:01:56.520> age<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.729> guy<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.150> your<00:01:57.210> experience<00:01:57.810> if

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
