00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello everyone, Alexander the Peace and 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.440
 channel review today i offer you 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.099
 look at the top of the gaming review 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.900
 keyboards 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.900
 steelseries apex roll 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 the keyboard comes here 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.240
 a large cardboard box on it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.140
 Benefit photos displayed 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 keyboard first thing that catches the eye 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 it's a huge space keyboard itself 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.699
 has a matte edging and glossy 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 cover between keys on matt 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.070
 fingerprints do not remain a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.809
 Here on gloss very well also on 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.190
 The keyboard has 17 additional 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.290
 keys for macros 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.590
 12 of them are located above the buttons f 1 of 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.190
 12 and 5 on the left side in the left upper 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 parts of the keyboard are located two buttons l1 and l2 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.800
 they serve to control the so-called 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.780
 key levels familiar to keyboards 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.820
 firm keys steelseries controls 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 multimedia settings which 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 placed on buttons f5 v12 via 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.690
 This button can change the level 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.910
 volume control multimedia and 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.220
 adjust the backlight level will tell 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.050
 Immediately the lights in this model are only 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.630
 white that is not so pleased 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.220
 little enter key for me she 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 very small so i often 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.049
 missed maybe get used and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.850
 the situation will improve 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.280
 control buttons has additional 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 I've never used these arrows 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 so now I'm not going to key 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.399
 easy and convenient to press 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.270
 due to the low speed they are not much noise 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.270
 with active use 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.140
 manual module replacement required 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.500
 are you ready to start the faulty module you 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.500
 ready to start 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.860
 grandfather interpreted to her no 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.110
 by the way by the way in order not to lose 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.150
 the most basic control buttons in games 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.400
 you on the keys w 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.380
 there are two bumps now buttons 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.959
 you can grope so hard 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.120
 from the monitor on keyboards with 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.190
 extra keys on the left side of me 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.470
 always enraged by the fact that the upper left corner 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.750
 busy with other buttons where usually 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.970
 escape is located even though 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.220
 that in this model the skate button has 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.420
 large size constantly pulls me 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.160
 press not on it is she l1 or l2 with 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.350
 the back side can be found large 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.630
 rubber feet that securely 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.640
 clings to the table without giving the keyboard 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.470
 move at will and with great 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.800
 diligence legs can be replaced by more 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.840
 high which are not included 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.450
 pumped up and software 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.430
 There is a rich steelseries engine here. 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.800
 management and setup functionality 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.220
 The keyboard first is the setting of the buttons 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.750
 here you can reassign all keys 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 setting macros on them or even 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.350
 shut off 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.819
 besides the whole setting happens for 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.670
 two levels so one button 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.620
 you can hang double functionality further 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.769
 You can control the brightness of the backlight and 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.080
 default usibi frequency 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.080
 polling frequency is 1000 hertz and 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.250
 last this statistic is clicked on 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.500
 keyboard buttons are displayed here 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.420
 how often do you click on 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.519
 a specific button in games or in 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.200
 office applications in the future this 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.430
 information can be used to 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.980
 macro assignments 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.019
 or reassigning buttons will be helpful 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.670
 for those who often use combinations 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.650
 keys at last I want to report the price 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.810
 cost series epix in 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.239
 online stores is 80 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.690
 dollars I can call it certain 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.690
 plus 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.120
 In general, I liked the keyboard 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.340
 liked the excellent responsive keys 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.830
 a lot of macro keys are nice 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.349
 lighting, though one color well, and most 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.900
 the main thing is a big gap on this 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.180
 thank you all for watching with you 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.990
 was Alexander the Peace and Channel Review 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.990
