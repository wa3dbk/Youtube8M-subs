00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.190 
this before and in junior I was 18 19
years<00:03:03.800> old<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:05.330> was<00:03:05.450> no<00:03:05.600> big<00:03:05.780> deal<00:03:05.990> then

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
years old and it was no big deal then

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.380 
years old and it was no big deal then
and<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.709> really<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.160> don't<00:03:07.400> consider<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.030> any<00:03:08.150> big

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
and I really I don't consider it any big

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.380 
and I really I don't consider it any big
deal<00:03:08.540> right<00:03:08.780> now<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.440> it's<00:03:10.120> pretty<00:03:11.120> much<00:03:11.240> a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
deal right now and it's pretty much a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.360 
deal right now and it's pretty much a
coach<00:03:11.750> player<00:03:12.140> relationship<00:03:12.980> during<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
coach player relationship during the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.310 
coach player relationship during the
season<00:03:13.760> which<00:03:14.240> i<00:03:14.360> think<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.690> good<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:14.900> both<00:03:15.170> of

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
season which i think is good for both of

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:28.760 
season which i think is good for both of
us

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.930 

No<00:03:29.570> are<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.780> kidding<00:03:31.290> how<00:03:32.220> do<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.400> push<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> guy

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
No are you kidding how do you push a guy

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.979 
No are you kidding how do you push a guy
out<00:03:33.120> there<00:03:33.980> that's<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.190> joke

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.860 

we<00:03:39.890> expect<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.340> win<00:03:40.549> games<00:03:40.849> and<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.510> think<00:03:41.719> when

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
we expect to win games and I think when

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.660 
we expect to win games and I think when
it<00:03:41.959> when<00:03:42.290> push<00:03:42.530> comes<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:42.920> shove<00:03:43.219> that's<00:03:43.489> going

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
it when push comes to shove that's going

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.009 
it when push comes to shove that's going
to<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.909> most<00:03:44.030> important<00:03:44.480> attribute<00:03:44.900> to

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
to be the most important attribute to

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.620 
to be the most important attribute to
this<00:03:45.109> hockey<00:03:45.349> team
