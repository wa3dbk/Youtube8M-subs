00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it's not a natural thing so I don't know

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
it's not a natural thing so I don't know
if<00:01:25.649> I'm<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.460> come<00:01:26.670> across<00:01:26.789> would<00:01:27.299> have

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
if I'm going to come across would have

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.940 
if I'm going to come across would have
been<00:01:27.509> fair<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> say<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> more

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
been fair to say that that more

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
been fair to say that that more
simplified<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:30.179> you<00:01:30.299> played<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
simplified where you played it the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
simplified where you played it the
second<00:01:31.110> time<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.770> getting<00:01:32.069> more<00:01:32.340> towards<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
second time is getting more towards the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.249 
second time is getting more towards the
kind<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.149> thing<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:34.049> something

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
kind of thing now that was something

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:43.639 
kind of thing now that was something
that<00:01:34.380> he'd<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> band<00:01:35.969> would<00:01:36.179> I<00:01:42.649> don't

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that he'd have a band would I don't

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
that he'd have a band would I don't
think<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:43.890> play<00:01:44.099> that<00:01:44.280> rhythm<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.819> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
think you play that rhythm but that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
think you play that rhythm but that
would<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.420> style<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:45.929> play<00:01:46.349> chords

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
would be that style you just play chords

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.789 
would be that style you just play chords

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
wouldn't he couldn't play that because

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
wouldn't he couldn't play that because
the<00:01:55.890> bands<00:01:56.159> playing<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.970> bass<00:01:57.179> players<00:01:57.509> wound

playing where he's playing especially
today<00:02:02.789> you'd<00:02:03.750> hardly<00:02:03.959> play<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
today you'd hardly play like that

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.100 
today you'd hardly play like that
because<00:02:05.489> of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.939> drummers<00:02:06.360> were<00:02:06.659> becoming

instead<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:15.060> don't<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.049> makes<00:02:16.260> any<00:02:16.440> sense

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
instead I don't that makes any sense

instead I don't that makes any sense
because<00:02:17.090> well<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.209> would<00:02:18.329> after<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.470> what

because well what would after that what

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.530 
because well what would after that what
would<00:02:19.799> be<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.370> next<00:02:20.730> kind<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.329> major

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
would be the next kind of major

course<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:27.180> take<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.859> Basie<00:02:29.060> there<00:02:30.060> was

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
course you take like a Basie there was

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.410 
course you take like a Basie there was
this<00:02:30.359> thing<00:02:31.069> which<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:34.880> king<00:02:35.880> called<00:02:36.180> did

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this thing which at the king called did

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.460 
this thing which at the king called did
it<00:02:36.540> was<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> trio<00:02:37.109> also<00:02:37.819> giving<00:02:38.819> example<00:02:39.480> guitar

it was a trio also giving example guitar
I'm<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.859> say<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:51.510> would<00:02:51.660> be<00:02:51.780> painting

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
I'm going to say that would be painting

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.420 
I'm going to say that would be painting
is<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> basement

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:10.090 

let's<00:03:01.430> move<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.060> good<00:03:02.360> time<00:03:08.890> basically<00:03:09.890> is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
let's move this a good time basically is

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.320 
let's move this a good time basically is
up<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.760> see

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
up like that see

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.720 
up like that see
then<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.750> band<00:03:11.959> would<00:03:12.170> come<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.590> now<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.580> was

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
then the band would come in now that was

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.280 
then the band would come in now that was
like<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> base<00:03:14.420> that's<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.750> way<00:03:14.870> he<00:03:15.050> used<00:03:15.200> to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
like a base that's the way he used to

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.110 
like a base that's the way he used to
play<00:03:15.500> there<00:03:15.830> very<00:03:16.100> simplified<00:03:16.730> version

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
play there very simplified version

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.870 
play there very simplified version
although<00:03:17.510> basic<00:03:18.380> did<00:03:18.590> have<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.100> technique<00:03:19.610> to

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
although basic did have the technique to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.680 
although basic did have the technique to
play<00:03:20.620> what<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.770> call<00:03:24.520> he<00:03:25.520> could<00:03:25.760> also<00:03:26.060> do<00:03:26.510> that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
play what to call he could also do that

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.070 
play what to call he could also do that
I<00:03:26.750> think<00:03:27.170> kid<00:03:27.980> from<00:03:28.130> Red<00:03:28.370> Bank<00:03:28.870> remember<00:03:29.870> kid

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
I think kid from Red Bank remember kid

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.199 
I think kid from Red Bank remember kid
from<00:03:30.230> Red<00:03:30.440> Bank<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.280> really<00:03:31.580> taught<00:03:31.820> that<00:03:32.030> up

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
from Red Bank you really taught that up

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.660 
from Red Bank you really taught that up
and<00:03:32.780> he<00:03:33.590> would<00:03:33.739> play<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.190> but<00:03:34.520> that

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
and he would play like that but that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.860 
and he would play like that but that
only<00:03:34.820> happened<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.270> I<00:03:35.300> would<00:03:35.510> only<00:03:35.660> have

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
only happened that I would only have

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.570 
only happened that I would only have
about<00:03:36.050> once<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.800> evening<00:03:37.160> or<00:03:37.280> something

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
about once in the evening or something

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.190 
about once in the evening or something
like<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.940> because<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.600> band<00:03:38.870> basically

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
like that because the band basically

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.490 
like that because the band basically
wasn't<00:03:40.750> built<00:03:41.750> around<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.320> particular

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
wasn't built around that particular

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.860 
wasn't built around that particular
style<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.890> use<00:03:46.550> all<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.000> those<00:03:47.420> elements

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
style and you use all of those elements

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.350 
style and you use all of those elements
in<00:03:48.110> your<00:03:48.200> playing<00:03:48.530> at<00:03:48.739> times<00:03:49.030> yeah<00:03:50.030> yeah

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
in your playing at times yeah yeah

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.350 
in your playing at times yeah yeah
that's<00:03:50.690> how<00:03:51.650> do<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.830> manage<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.880> combine

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
that's how do you manage to to combine

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.330 
that's how do you manage to to combine
them<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.050> comes<00:03:54.200> out<00:03:54.380> Jackie<00:03:54.770> well<00:03:55.160> it

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
them so that it comes out Jackie well it

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.100 
them so that it comes out Jackie well it
all<00:03:55.489> depends<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.120> know<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.270> all<00:03:56.420> depends<00:03:56.840> on

the piano because I believe in the
