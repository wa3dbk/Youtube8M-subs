the earth we don't know for sure but now

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.759

this<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.599> holy<00:02:46.989> grail<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.470> astronomy

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
this is the holy grail of astronomy

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.490 
this is the holy grail of astronomy

finding an earth-like twin because where

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.460 
finding an earth-like twin because where
there's<00:02:50.530> water<00:02:51.150> there's<00:02:52.150> usually<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:52.930> the

there's water there's usually like the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.070 
there's water there's usually like the
detectives<00:02:54.160> say<00:02:54.400> follow<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.910> money<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.780> find

detectives say follow the money we find

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.350 
detectives say follow the money we find
to<00:02:56.260> say<00:02:56.470> follow<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.010> water<00:02:57.430> liquid<00:02:57.940> water

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
to say follow the water liquid water

to say follow the water liquid water
liquid<00:02:58.660> oceans<00:02:59.170> because<00:02:59.590> that's<00:02:59.769> where<00:02:59.980> life

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
liquid oceans because that's where life

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.180 
liquid oceans because that's where life
and<00:03:00.489> DNA<00:03:01.000> first<00:03:01.390> got<00:03:01.690> off<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.079> ground<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:03.010> if

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and DNA first got off the ground so if

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.910 
and DNA first got off the ground so if
this<00:03:03.310> planet<00:03:03.640> has<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.970> liquid<00:03:04.510> ocean<00:03:04.920> chances

aliens from outer space perhaps so even

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.319 
aliens from outer space perhaps so even

if we were able to send a signal how

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.910 
if we were able to send a signal how

would we communicate that's exactly
right<00:03:36.340> if<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.609> have<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.730> message<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.299> bottle

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
right if you have a message in a bottle

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.539 
right if you have a message in a bottle
in<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.959> ocean<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.530> can't<00:03:38.739> communicate<00:03:38.980> back

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
in the ocean you can't communicate back

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.770 
in the ocean you can't communicate back
to<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> chemicals<00:03:40.209> they<00:03:40.269> give<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.600> message

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
to the chemicals they give the message

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.140 
to the chemicals they give the message
in<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.139> bottle<00:03:41.170> right<00:03:41.889> which<00:03:42.430> makes<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:42.910> seem

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
in a bottle right which makes it seem

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.120 
in a bottle right which makes it seem
all<00:03:43.329> kind<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:43.720> kind<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.200> strange<00:03:44.470> good<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.950> can

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
all kind of kind of strange good I can

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.559 
all kind of kind of strange good I can
understand<00:03:45.519> up<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.880> came<00:03:46.120> up<00:03:46.299> with<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> idea

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
understand up you came up with the idea

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.590 
understand up you came up with the idea
I<00:03:47.230> got<00:03:47.769> a<00:03:47.829> set<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.340> NASA<00:03:48.670> came<00:03:49.120> up<00:03:49.269> with<00:03:49.420> an<00:03:49.540> idea

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
I got a set of NASA came up with an idea

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.870 
I got a set of NASA came up with an idea
and<00:03:50.410> what<00:03:50.560> about<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.920> United<00:03:51.280> Nations<00:03:51.400> I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
and what about the United Nations I

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.000 
and what about the United Nations I
think<00:03:52.389> they<00:03:52.480> want<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> stake<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.900> claim<00:03:53.109> because

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
think they want to stake a claim because

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.309 
think they want to stake a claim because
right<00:03:54.280> now<00:03:54.340> there<00:03:54.730> are<00:03:54.760> no<00:03:55.060> protocols<00:03:55.329> there's

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
right now there are no protocols there's

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.770 
right now there are no protocols there's
no<00:03:56.590> way<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.340> address<00:03:57.880> an<00:03:58.120> alien<00:03:58.630> ambassador

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
no way to address an alien ambassador

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.440 
no way to address an alien ambassador
there's<00:03:59.560> no<00:03:59.709> way<00:03:59.889> to<00:03:59.950> set<00:04:00.280> up<00:04:00.430> how<00:04:00.790> trade<00:04:01.239> would

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
there's no way to set up how trade would

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.240 
there's no way to set up how trade would
be<00:04:01.630> quite<00:04:01.900> communications<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:02.950> information

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
be quite communications and information

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.339 
be quite communications and information
will<00:04:03.819> be<00:04:03.849> exchanged<00:04:04.389> so<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> think<00:04:04.900> they<00:04:05.139> want

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
will be exchanged so I think they want

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.199 
will be exchanged so I think they want
to<00:04:05.410> like<00:04:05.530> put<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.739> stake<00:04:06.069> in<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.639> in<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:06.880> ground

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
to like put a stake in the in the ground

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.629 
to like put a stake in the in the ground
and<00:04:07.420> say<00:04:07.660> we<00:04:08.139> claim<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.500> in<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.280> name<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.459> the

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
and say we claim this in the name of the

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.979 
and say we claim this in the name of the
United<00:04:09.940> Nations<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.299> now<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.480> know<00:04:10.660> there<00:04:10.959> are

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
United Nations and now I know there are

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.990 
United Nations and now I know there are
others<00:04:11.319> who<00:04:11.500> believe<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:12.220> life<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.849> outer

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
what it is right now and I sure think we

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.010 
what it is right now and I sure think we
should<00:05:07.620> identify<00:05:07.800> what<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.940> for<00:05:09.389> America

explore the moon and develop the moon we

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.089
