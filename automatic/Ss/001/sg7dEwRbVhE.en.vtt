00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
hair but I kind of messed it up I used

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
hair but I kind of messed it up I used
to<00:00:20.880> 40<00:00:21.180> volume<00:00:21.449> developer<00:00:21.660> when<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> bleached

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
to 40 volume developer when I bleached

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.650 
to 40 volume developer when I bleached
and<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.590> said<00:00:22.830> should<00:00:23.100> use<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.460> 20<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.420> kind

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and I said should use to 20 so it's kind

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.120 
and I said should use to 20 so it's kind
of<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.140> dry<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> end<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:25.980> it's

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
of like really dry at the end so it's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.060 
of like really dry at the end so it's
causing<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> lot<00:00:26.670> tangling<00:00:27.330> um<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.800> see

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
causing a lot tangling um if you can see

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.450 
causing a lot tangling um if you can see
it<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.340> mats<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.300> right<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.460> don't

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
it like mats up like right here I don't
know<00:00:32.520> why<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.880> literally<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.829> right

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.970 
know why it's literally just like right
here<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.430> um<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> hard<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> like

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
here so um it's kind of hard to like

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.610 
here so um it's kind of hard to like
comb<00:00:38.520> through<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.660> brushed<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
comb through I just brushed it so it's a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.860 
comb through I just brushed it so it's a
little<00:00:40.920> bit<00:00:41.010> easier<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.390> closure<00:00:42.660> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
little bit easier now but the closure is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260 
little bit easier now but the closure is
still<00:00:43.079> fine<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> closure<00:00:44.270> combs

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
still fine like the closure combs

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.880 
still fine like the closure combs
through<00:00:45.390> easily<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.289> hair<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
through easily but the hair is a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.600 
through easily but the hair is a
struggle<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.789> um<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
struggle for me um so I'm going to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.740 
struggle for me um so I'm going to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
take some time and get new glue I used

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.600 
take some time and get new glue I used
the<00:01:39.659> UM<00:01:40.790> 30<00:01:41.930> second<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.350> Express<00:01:43.979> glue<00:01:44.430> or

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the UM 30 second like Express glue or

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980 
the UM 30 second like Express glue or
something<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.149> I'll<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> figure

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
something like that I'll have to figure

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.270 
something like that I'll have to figure
out<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> name<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> put

out what the name of that is and put

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.569 
out what the name of that is and put
that<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.180> bottom<00:01:48.479> bar<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.750> well<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.579> think

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that in the bottom bar as well I think

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.240 
that in the bottom bar as well I think
that's<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.810> my<00:01:51.960> three-week<00:01:52.409> review
