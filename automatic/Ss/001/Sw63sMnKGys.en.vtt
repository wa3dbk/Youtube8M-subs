00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
welcome to digital tool box today we're

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.340 
welcome to digital tool box today we're
going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.460> create<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:03.000> door<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.899> we<00:00:04.080> can

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
going to create a door that we can

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.730 
going to create a door that we can
adjust<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.430> height<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.120> width<00:00:06.359> and

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
adjust the height and the width and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.860 
adjust the height and the width and
other<00:00:08.750> variables<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.200> our<00:00:10.349> door<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.750> we<00:00:12.750> can

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
other variables to our door and we can

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.039 
other variables to our door and we can
also<00:00:12.990> adjust<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.500> door<00:00:13.769> swings<00:00:14.389> degree<00:00:15.389> so

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
also adjust the door swings degree so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.040 
also adjust the door swings degree so
when<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.350> make<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> into<00:00:17.520> rhino<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.210> apply

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
when we make this into rhino and apply

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529 
when we make this into rhino and apply
to<00:00:19.109> our<00:00:19.260> model<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.520> create<00:00:20.850> sections<00:00:21.150> we

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
to our model and we create sections we

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.290 
to our model and we create sections we
don't<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.050> recreate<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> arcs<00:00:23.340> or<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
don't have to recreate the arcs or the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.210 
don't have to recreate the arcs or the
door<00:00:24.480> stops<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> door<00:00:25.320> frames<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.980> create

for each slider to convert into inches
in<00:02:02.159> Rhino<00:02:03.000> since<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:04.200> usually<00:02:04.560> use<00:02:04.590> feet<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
in Rhino since we usually use feet in

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.490 
in Rhino since we usually use feet in
the<00:02:05.520> Rhino<00:02:05.729> models<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.810> everything<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.350> going

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the Rhino models so everything is going

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.889 
the Rhino models so everything is going
to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.619> x<00:02:07.799> over<00:02:08.039> 12<00:02:08.310> except<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.239> degrees

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
to be x over 12 except for the degrees

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.650 
to be x over 12 except for the degrees
which<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.830> x<00:02:11.340> over<00:02:12.000> 300

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
which is going to be x over 300

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.080 
which is going to be x over 300
60<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.170> you'll<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.220> why<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.580> need<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.760> divide

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
60 and you'll see why we need to divide

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.700 
60 and you'll see why we need to divide
by<00:02:15.330> 360<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.610> tutorial<00:02:18.030> goes<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
by 360 it as the tutorial goes on so to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.280 
by 360 it as the tutorial goes on so to
create<00:02:19.920> our<00:02:20.160> door<00:02:20.400> frame<00:02:20.900> we're<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.200> to

create our door frame we're going to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.490 
create our door frame we're going to
need<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.740> box<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.430> surface<00:02:24.150> under<00:02:25.110> primitive

need to add the door frames thickness

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.120 
need to add the door frames thickness
plus<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.400> door<00:02:41.610> with<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.500> door<00:02:43.740> with<00:02:43.920> is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
plus the door with so the door with is

going to be the first the first slider

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
going to be the first the first slider
so<00:02:47.970> I'm<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> add<00:02:48.270> then<00:02:48.450> 2x<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.590> door

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
so I'm going to add then 2x and the door

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
so I'm going to add then 2x and the door
thickness<00:02:50.360> which<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.840> last<00:02:52.080> slider<00:02:53.750> goes

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
thickness which is the last slider goes

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.650 
thickness which is the last slider goes
into<00:02:54.960> y<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> make<00:02:57.120> sure<00:02:57.300> door

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
frames with door frame thickness so into

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.990 
frames with door frame thickness so into
the<00:03:01.200> expression<00:03:01.500> editor<00:03:01.800> I'm<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.850> type

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the expression editor I'm going to type

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
door frames thickness by 2 because we

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.020 
door frames thickness by 2 because we
need<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.290> add<00:03:13.440> an<00:03:13.830> inch<00:03:14.160> on<00:03:14.370> each<00:03:14.610> side<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.910> the

door height plus the door thickness I'm

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.760 
door height plus the door thickness I'm
in<00:03:29.580> door<00:03:29.820> frames<00:03:30.090> thickness<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.380> we're<00:03:31.620> going

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
in door frames thickness so we're going

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.280 
in door frames thickness so we're going

to need to variable expression again the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.410 
to need to variable expression again the
door<00:03:34.530> height<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.580> third<00:03:35.940> X<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
dirt slider which is the third function

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.840 
dirt slider which is the third function
adding<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.350> from<00:03:40.620> adding<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> thickness<00:03:41.640> also

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
adding it from adding the thickness also

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.920 
adding it from adding the thickness also
so<00:03:42.720> X<00:03:42.930> plus<00:03:43.170> y

door or the door frame and then y which
is<00:03:56.200> going<00:03:56.469> to<00:03:56.560> be<00:03:56.680> our<00:03:56.890> thickness<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.989> that's

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
is going to be our thickness and that's

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.890 
is going to be our thickness and that's
just<00:03:59.140> going<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.409> go<00:03:59.500> into<00:03:59.620> why<00:04:00.629> so<00:04:01.629> that's<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
just going to go into why so that's the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.110 
just going to go into why so that's the
overall<00:04:02.319> width<00:04:02.799> of<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.250> door<00:04:03.430> frame<00:04:03.459> we<00:04:03.969> need

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
overall width of the door frame we need

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.080 
overall width of the door frame we need
to<00:04:04.299> subtract<00:04:05.139> this<00:04:05.560> box<00:04:05.859> with<00:04:06.129> another<00:04:06.370> box<00:04:06.609> to

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
to subtract this box with another box to

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.420 
to subtract this box with another box to
get<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.510> actual<00:04:07.810> frame<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:09.069> we<00:04:09.189> can<00:04:09.280> go<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
get the actual frame so we can go to the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.220 
get the actual frame so we can go to the
surface<00:04:09.670> go<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.180> primitive<00:04:10.420> grab<00:04:10.840> another

the<00:04:19.060> Y<00:04:19.329> will<00:04:19.630> be<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.989> same<00:04:20.199> width<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:22.150> door

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
the Y will be the same width of the door

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.930 
the Y will be the same width of the door
frame<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:22.900> then<00:04:23.440> X<00:04:23.740> will<00:04:24.580> be<00:04:24.610> on<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:26.410> door<00:04:26.940> the

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
frame and then X will be on the door the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.010 
frame and then X will be on the door the
door<00:04:28.150> with<00:04:29.789> so<00:04:30.789> now<00:04:30.910> we<00:04:30.970> need<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.270> move<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
door with so now we need to move the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.499 
door with so now we need to move the
overall<00:04:32.470> width<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> door<00:04:33.669> over<00:04:34.120> by<00:04:34.270> one

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
overall width of the door over by one

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.450 
overall width of the door over by one
inch<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.229> these<00:04:35.470> two<00:04:35.650> blocks<00:04:35.889> are<00:04:36.070> Center

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
inch so that these two blocks are Center

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.510 
inch so that these two blocks are Center
to<00:04:36.759> each<00:04:36.849> other<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.800> do<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.009> I'm<00:04:39.310> going<00:04:39.430> to

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
to each other so to do that I'm going to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.760 
to each other so to do that I'm going to
go<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.000> X<00:04:40.210> form<00:04:40.570> when<00:04:41.560> Euclidean<00:04:42.240> remove<00:04:43.770> I'm

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
go to X form when Euclidean remove I'm

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.650 
go to X form when Euclidean remove I'm
going<00:04:45.009> to<00:04:45.070> put<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.400> box<00:04:45.610> into<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.030> geometry

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
going to put this box into the geometry

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.990 
going to put this box into the geometry
and<00:04:46.870> then<00:04:47.710> we<00:04:47.800> need<00:04:47.889> to<00:04:47.949> move<00:04:48.099> it<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.759> X

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
and then we need to move it in the X

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.159 
and then we need to move it in the X
direction<00:04:49.599> so<00:04:50.530> go<00:04:50.680> go<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.190> vector<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:52.599> grab

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
direction so go go to vector and grab

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.540 
direction so go go to vector and grab
the<00:04:53.349> X<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:55.590> then<00:04:56.590> we<00:04:56.740> need<00:04:56.889> to<00:04:56.979> move<00:04:57.099> it<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.400> the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
the X and then we need to move it in the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.029 
the X and then we need to move it in the
negative<00:04:58.199> direction<00:04:59.199> of<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.409> door<00:04:59.650> frames

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
negative direction of the door frames

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.760 
negative direction of the door frames
thickness<00:05:00.729> so<00:05:01.630> let<00:05:01.720> me<00:05:01.780> go<00:05:01.900> logic<00:05:02.409> and<00:05:02.590> grab

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
thickness so let me go logic and grab

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.610 
thickness so let me go logic and grab
the<00:05:03.190> one<00:05:03.760> variable<00:05:04.030> expression<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:05.470> is

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
the one variable expression and this is

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.170 
the one variable expression and this is
going<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:05.979> be<00:05:06.099> negative<00:05:06.370> x<00:05:08.639> put<00:05:09.639> that<00:05:09.789> into<00:05:09.940> F

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
going to be negative x put that into F

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.740 
going to be negative x put that into F
and<00:05:11.460> then<00:05:12.460> put<00:05:12.760> this<00:05:12.880> into<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:14.139> thickness<00:05:15.750> and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
and then put this into the thickness and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.560 
and then put this into the thickness and
I'm<00:05:16.870> going<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.080> unbox<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.120> guys<00:05:19.210> can<00:05:19.360> see

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
I'm going to unbox so you guys can see

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.170 
I'm going to unbox so you guys can see
that<00:05:19.800> now<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:20.979> their<00:05:21.099> Center<00:05:21.490> from<00:05:21.669> each<00:05:21.820> to

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
that now that their Center from each to

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.379 
that now that their Center from each to
each<00:05:22.300> other<00:05:22.509> and<00:05:22.720> then<00:05:23.080> I'm<00:05:23.289> going<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.800> go<00:05:23.949> to

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
each other and then I'm going to go to

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.879 
each other and then I'm going to go to
intersect<00:05:25.389> go<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.750> bullying<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.440> grab<00:05:26.740> the

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
intersect go to bullying and grab the

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.830 
intersect go to bullying and grab the
solid<00:05:27.220> difference<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:31.090> apply<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.630> box

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
solid difference and apply to the box

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:44.550 
solid difference and apply to the box
and<00:05:32.110> move<00:05:32.289> and<00:05:32.590> then<00:05:41.340> unproven<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:44.320> do<00:05:44.409> that

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
and move and then unproven you do that

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.010 
and move and then unproven you do that
is<00:05:44.740> because<00:05:45.210> when<00:05:46.210> i<00:05:46.240> close<00:05:46.539> the<00:05:46.750> door<00:05:47.490> here<00:05:48.490> i

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
is because when i close the door here i

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.740 
is because when i close the door here i
want<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.110> door<00:05:50.320> to<00:05:50.349> be<00:05:50.830> flush<00:05:51.130> with<00:05:51.159> the<00:05:51.400> frame

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
want the door to be flush with the frame

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.040 
want the door to be flush with the frame
and<00:05:53.699> we're<00:05:54.699> going<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.880> set<00:05:55.090> this<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.630> door<00:05:55.840> at

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
and we're going to set this the door at

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.430 
and we're going to set this the door at
the<00:05:56.200> origin<00:05:56.590> of<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:57.010> axes

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
the origin of the axes

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.550 
the origin of the axes
so<00:05:59.440> to<00:06:00.310> do<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.520> we're<00:06:00.850> going<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:01.389> move<00:06:02.169> this

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
so to do that we're going to move this

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.010 
so to do that we're going to move this
form<00:06:03.190> this<00:06:03.699> geometry<00:06:03.910> again<00:06:04.419> so<00:06:04.600> I'm<00:06:04.690> going<00:06:04.960> to

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
form this geometry again so I'm going to

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.460 
form this geometry again so I'm going to
grab<00:06:05.289> another<00:06:05.590> move<00:06:06.280> button<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.870> we're<00:06:08.350> going

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
grab another move button and we're going

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.200 
grab another move button and we're going
to<00:06:08.500> move<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:08.830> in<00:06:08.949> the<00:06:09.160> Y<00:06:09.340> direction<00:06:09.850> so<00:06:10.000> go<00:06:10.150> to

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
to move it in the Y direction so go to

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.749 
to move it in the Y direction so go to
vector<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:10.720> grab<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.650> Y<00:06:11.889> vector<00:06:12.449> and<00:06:14.430> then<00:06:15.430> to

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
vector and grab the Y vector and then to

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.580 
vector and grab the Y vector and then to
move<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.150> we're<00:06:16.300> going<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.509> take<00:06:16.660> the<00:06:16.840> door<00:06:17.139> on

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
move it we're going to take the door on

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.580 
move it we're going to take the door on
the<00:06:18.280> door<00:06:18.460> with<00:06:18.759> and<00:06:19.090> then<00:06:20.050> subtract<00:06:20.440> it<00:06:20.560> from

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
the door with and then subtract it from

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.520 
the door with and then subtract it from
the<00:06:20.919> door<00:06:21.160> or<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.669> door<00:06:22.449> frames<00:06:22.750> with<00:06:23.259> and

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
the door or the door frames with and

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.450 
the door or the door frames with and
subtracted<00:06:24.070> from<00:06:24.100> the<00:06:24.280> door<00:06:25.210> thickness<00:06:26.460> so

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
subtracted from the door thickness so

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.800 
subtracted from the door thickness so
another<00:06:27.699> two<00:06:27.910> variable<00:06:28.270> expression<00:06:30.570> Y<00:06:31.570> will

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
another two variable expression Y will

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.960 
another two variable expression Y will
go<00:06:31.900> into<00:06:32.050> I<00:06:32.320> mean<00:06:32.949> the<00:06:33.009> door<00:06:33.190> frames<00:06:33.460> thickness

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
go into I mean the door frames thickness

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.370 
go into I mean the door frames thickness
we're<00:06:34.180> going<00:06:34.389> to<00:06:34.479> X<00:06:34.720> and<00:06:35.050> then<00:06:36.009> the<00:06:36.509> door<00:06:37.509> door

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
we're going to X and then the door door

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.710 
we're going to X and then the door door
thickness<00:06:39.099> will<00:06:39.460> go<00:06:39.550> into<00:06:39.699> why<00:06:39.880> and<00:06:40.180> the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
thickness will go into why and the

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.939 
thickness will go into why and the
expression<00:06:41.259> will<00:06:41.380> be<00:06:41.500> Y<00:06:41.800> minus<00:06:42.070> X<00:06:43.949> commit

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
expression will be Y minus X commit

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:53.749 
expression will be Y minus X commit
changes<00:06:49.500> so<00:06:50.500> now<00:06:50.620> let's<00:06:50.770> move<00:06:50.949> forward

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.779 

unpretty<00:06:54.759> the<00:06:54.910> difference<00:06:56.009> so<00:06:57.009> now<00:06:57.130> our<00:06:57.160> door

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
unpretty the difference so now our door

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:01.529 
unpretty the difference so now our door
