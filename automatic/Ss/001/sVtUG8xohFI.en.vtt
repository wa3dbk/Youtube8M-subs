00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 as you can see onions are ready to cut and 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.300
 further processing it now in 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.630
 this video we show how we do it 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.289
 We cut off the stella from the shelves and how it 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.580
 rework for it for the fairy tale onions 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.680
 ground we use here such knives 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:29.789
 jagged why jagged exactly 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.719
 Now you will understand it as you see nothing 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.820
 difficult to cut the onion itself 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.170
 videos are available and clearly hope 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 the only thing I would like to say is you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 I said initially to ground 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.440
 for must be initially aligned for 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.090
 shelving it contributes but because 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 it is convenient to plant in the first place bows and secondly 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.420
 when cutting you will not stumble on 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.400
 some lumps 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:11.750
 that is, for convenience initially 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 good ground level the tool itself 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.310
 I hope nothing complicated no questions 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.310
 you will not have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 games 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.840
 If in the process of a cut, I noticed that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 you some bulbs 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.150
 some feather did not come you can 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.890
 leave on the shelf until 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.950
 if you are not in a hurry and do not deserve 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.470
 news lazhi that's how it is now 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.350
 bulk cleaning smile agatis principle 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.560
 put planting will not and now do not let 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.380
 no more expensive and the bow feather from the bow we left 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 in place that is now in a few 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 days it will reach you less often we also 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.220
 add to the total mass now as he 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 we show if the bow is not old enough 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:18.470
 he is just starting to release pen we him 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.470
 Immediately here we separate and sit down 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:27.269
 seated separately on the liberated 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.269
 plot let's go 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.860
 just like that 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:45.180
 little by little the club will be ready 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.410
 implementation here will get bigger 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.520
 off-road here which starts off 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.520
 which is starting to leave the ground at 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.050
 newbies this question often 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.170
 why and how to do so 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.600
 onion growth is uniform but first of all 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.630
 Of course it is necessary not to be lazy him 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.450
 sort before planting as 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.180
 said earlier the opera has different terms 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.480
 various rare large medium and small 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.210
 different terms of the outback of the pen that is though 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 would you somehow have the same type of bow on 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.150
 shelving grow if you him 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.330
 sort out someone trying to advise 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.070
 how do you expel him chemicals no hecken 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.470
 that is, and some 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:47.150
 fertilizers to be honest in the total mass 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.250
 when i don't know how to do it so 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.160
 only this way we can offer you 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.860
 transplant onions and at least you even if he 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.170
 not fully grow you any part 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.170
 money from this turnip anyway take 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.180
 here you can look like this ground 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.820
 looks after cutting onions remain 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.230
 roots in principle but they go deep 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:16.940
 into the ground into the ground but still 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.180
 after even such a bow we never for 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.820
 the season we don't loosen the earth just further 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.230
 also sits down and bow walks and 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.880
 unnecessary to loosen not an hour of this land 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.420
 do stupid anyway find your place 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.680
 he will find a place to take root, and the same 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.040
 normally will continue to grow and expel 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.040
 green first 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.960
 as you can see on average the power we have in 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.480
 this greenhouse 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.889
 the onion is planted again that is, we have it 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.070
 cut passed 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:03.180
 and rather try to re-plant 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.150
 new turnip as we see in the empty 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.780
 shelves that are not planted this if 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.030
 you help it that is not we don't 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.000
 go to the bridge that is cleaned planted 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.180
 onions if you wait a while or 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.870
 you will have something to do with it 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.580
 can't 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.350
 well there will be no planting material or 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.020
 something that did not have time let's say 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.360
 in advance to prepare it we think that it 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.660
 loss of profit so they cut the bow and 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.480
 Immediately plant new ones there already 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.730
 look for sales new sales new market 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.980
 that is, this process should not 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.930
 how to stop bow cut and 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.270
 need to recycle it 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.330
 very simple for that we use 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.860
 knives with shallow with small serrated 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.160
 do it that way just above the roots 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:58.380
 prune 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:06:01.340
 and the pen and the bow is easily pulled out then 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.340
 eat like that 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.020
 yes try as close to the root as possible 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:26.729
 by chop because weight 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:30.530
 accordingly there will be more here as well 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:32.819
 notice one more thing onion is very easy 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.550
 pirogov is very easily pulled out and 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:39.479
 turnips it's due to the fact that 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:43.699
 sound from us was originally from the first 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:48.860
 turnip bow was cut tail 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.860
 so pervach easily pulled out the game
