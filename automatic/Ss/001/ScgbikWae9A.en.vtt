00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.660
 meet others who are going 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.280

 prepare to snatch a tell you from 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.290
 our whole heart for this event 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290
 exceptional 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.590
 caravans it's true that the first 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 edition but on a month but I think 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.610
 that we rode like a merry of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.860
 prepare together event for the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.930
 drug and it's true that from the same heart 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 together for the second edition we 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.230
 still want together prepared 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 hard but certainly all the joy 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.590
 that we have been able to bring to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.300
 different people who will be 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.200
 present 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.200
 adoration to the Lord by that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.220
 actually a fortnight is a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 breakthrough and breakthrough through dance 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.320
 through the ad and for me this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240
 concept simply since the dance 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.940
 is part of the elements that the Lord 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.560
 gives us to be able to have a lanyard 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.880
 a complete adoration that's also 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.230
 dancers actually in the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.870
 word of god of the singers of 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.110
 musicians and all that constitutes 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.240
 the set that the Lord asks us 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.190
 to give him and eat us 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.740
 the flourishing elaboration that allows us 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.900
 of sedatives to sit while aravan 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.600
 it's also simply the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.459
 manifestation of an awakening since the crc 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.930
 this ministry the meaning of one with 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.790
 christian gramond positioned for the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.900
 awakening of France but also for the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.300
 waking up of nations and that's some 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.440
 thing we see since conference 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.360
 International attract souls are 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.340
 here and make Paris the capital of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 the liturgical dance in order to be able 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.360
 attract the presence of god and wake up 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.670
 the bodies revealed the Christians 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.590
 wake up Christians the artists that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.000
 it all really got into 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.000
 a dimension of two babies 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.940
 but
