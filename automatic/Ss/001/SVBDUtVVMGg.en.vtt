see<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.030> nuances<00:01:23.450> get<00:01:23.690> down<00:01:23.869> low<00:01:24.080> look<00:01:24.380> where

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
see the nuances get down low look where

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.200 
see the nuances get down low look where
the<00:01:24.590> cambers<00:01:24.979> are<00:01:25.130> look<00:01:25.580> at<00:01:25.670> curbs<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.119> you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
the cambers are look at curbs that you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.580 
the cambers are look at curbs that you
can<00:01:26.360> utilize<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:26.900> curbs<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.350> can't

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
can utilize and curbs that you can't

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.960 
can utilize and curbs that you can't
because<00:01:27.860> oftentimes<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.369> just<00:01:28.580> go<00:01:28.700> out<00:01:28.850> there

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
because oftentimes you just go out there

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.550 
because oftentimes you just go out there
at<00:01:29.119> speed<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.720> it<00:01:30.020> looks<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.350> lot<00:01:30.500> different

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
at speed and it looks a lot different

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.929

than<00:01:31.070> if<00:01:31.189> you're<00:01:31.340> out<00:01:31.490> there<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:31.790> can

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
than if you're out there and you can

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.300 
than if you're out there and you can
really<00:01:32.150> study<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.479> on<00:01:32.630> foot<00:01:32.990> or<00:01:33.140> on<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.260> bicycle

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
the video games and racing you know if I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.370 
the video games and racing you know if I
needed<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:44.210> learn<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.509> new<00:01:44.720> track<00:01:44.930> I'll<00:01:45.110> spend

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
needed to learn a new track I'll spend

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.410

week<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.400> mean<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.270> start<00:01:50.509> out<00:01:50.720> if<00:01:50.960> it's

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
week I mean I like to start out if it's

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.109 
week I mean I like to start out if it's
all<00:01:51.259> possible<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.890> go<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.280> racing<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.939> look

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
all possible I go on I racing and look

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.630 
all possible I go on I racing and look
it<00:01:53.240> up<00:01:53.330> on<00:01:53.540> there<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.220> learn<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.400> track

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
it up on there and and learn the track

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.240 
it up on there and and learn the track
because<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:57.020> know<00:01:57.079> that<00:01:57.380> layout<00:01:57.829> knowing

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
because you know that layout knowing

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
because you know that layout knowing
when<00:01:58.400> you're<00:01:58.520> going<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.670> turn<00:01:58.820> left<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.180> right

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
accurate than the iRacing software so

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.649 
accurate than the iRacing software so
they<00:02:03.619> ask<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.950> big<00:02:04.100> one<00:02:04.280> for<00:02:04.430> me<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.509> don't

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
they ask the big one for me if you don't

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.589 
they ask the big one for me if you don't
know<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.140> track<00:02:06.650> if<00:02:06.829> it's<00:02:06.979> not<00:02:07.189> on<00:02:07.369> on<00:02:08.270> any

know the track if it's not on on any

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.190 
know the track if it's not on on any
software<00:02:09.110> anyway

software anyway

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380

you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:11.129> best<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.640> walk<00:02:12.209> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you know it's it's best just to walk it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.080 
you know it's it's best just to walk it
first<00:02:12.720> look<00:02:13.440> at<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.709> go<00:02:14.430> back<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.819> your<00:02:14.910> hotel

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
first look at it go back to your hotel

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
first look at it go back to your hotel
that<00:02:15.360> night<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.840> next<00:02:15.959> morning<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.440> go<00:02:16.560> out

in<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.830> race<00:02:16.980> car<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> first<00:02:17.819> lap<00:02:18.030> take

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
in the race car and the first lap take

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.350 
in the race car and the first lap take
it<00:02:18.450> easy<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.019> build<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.360> it's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
it easy and then build it up and it's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.880 
it easy and then build it up and it's
all<00:02:21.569> about<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.930> sight<00:02:22.170> picture<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:22.739> where

all about the sight picture and where

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.619 
all about the sight picture and where
you<00:02:23.010> got<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.340> looking<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.910> you're<00:02:24.360> looking

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
you got to be looking so you're looking

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.050 
you got to be looking so you're looking
for<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.440> references<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.250> breaking<00:02:26.760> for

first time I spent hours I actually flew

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110 
first time I spent hours I actually flew
it<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.260> Texas<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.340> spent<00:02:38.610> hours<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.090> a
