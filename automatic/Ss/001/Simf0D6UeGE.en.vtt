00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.410 
coach and I scored a goal you know well
against<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> runner<00:03:09.709> play<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:11.330> know

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
against the runner play and you know

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.699 
against the runner play and you know
rightly<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:11.930> they<00:03:12.080> went<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.319> won<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> game

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
rightly so they went to won the game

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.220 
rightly so they went to won the game
because<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.310> scored<00:03:13.519> two<00:03:13.760> goals<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.269> apart

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
because I scored two goals but apart

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.539 
because I scored two goals but apart
from<00:03:15.260> scoring<00:03:15.650> chances<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.160> don't<00:03:16.340> think<00:03:16.459> we

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
from scoring chances I don't think we

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.460 
from scoring chances I don't think we
could<00:03:16.670> have<00:03:16.700> done<00:03:16.850> much<00:03:17.060> more<00:03:17.140> but<00:03:18.140> certainly

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
could have done much more but certainly

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.810 
could have done much more but certainly
we've<00:03:18.680> got<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.920> tighten<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.459> set<00:03:19.670> pieces

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
we've got to tighten up on set pieces

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.330 
we've got to tighten up on set pieces
because<00:03:20.329> that's<00:03:21.140> maybe<00:03:21.470> five<00:03:21.769> or<00:03:21.799> six<00:03:22.130> goals

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
because that's maybe five or six goals

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.400 
because that's maybe five or six goals
out<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.700> nine<00:03:22.880> we've<00:03:23.570> conceded<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.200> year
