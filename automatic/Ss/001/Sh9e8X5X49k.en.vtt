00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 most floor paints 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.420
 traditional need temperatures 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.330
 greater than 15 degrees to dry 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.550
 properly paint areas not 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 heated or very cold so always has 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 been difficult based on the last 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.619
 aspartic peeled technology the big 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.650
 cold epoxy is the answer to these 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.080
 complicated applications so you can 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.940
 paint these unheated areas like the 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.280
 cold rooms in operation 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.610
 where other paintings could not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 dried to do this equip yourself with a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 spatula of a paint blender of a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.530
 bac paint a brush of a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.449
 short-haired roller with its handle 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 telescopic and a pair of gloves 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.110
 before going through the application make sure 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 you that the surface is clean without 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.199
 ice and that the temperature is not 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 lower than -10 Â° concrete floors 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.530
 must be at least four 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.600
 weeks dry and contaminant free 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.429
 traces of oil or grease must 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 be cleaned with a degreaser 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:21.929
 industrial as the soil degree then 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.479
 rinse the smooth concrete or 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.520
 milt should be treated with a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.830
 acid treatment like the caps ground 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.569
 to ensure good adherence to the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.030
 painting 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.459
 previously pinted surfaces must 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.440
 be thought to give a key across 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.750
 he was cleaning up friable parts 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.020
 if rain is expected to repel 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 application 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.050
 store the big cold epoxy at 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.230
 ambient temperature for the fluidify 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.730
 before mixing 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.440
 then remove the two small cans 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:59.750
 of the main can begin with 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.120
 mix the resin thoroughly and then 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.730
 pour the contents of the two cans into 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.450
 the main can by scraping well on 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.250
 the sides and in the bottom mix the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.410
 two components using the mixer to 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.100
 painting until a 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.090
 consistency and uniform color 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.470
 then decant in the paint tray 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.900
 started by painting the edges of the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.850
 area with a brush 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.950
 then apply a single layer with 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750
 the short-haired roller 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.400
 refrigerated environments like 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.250
 cold rooms can be painted 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.230
 without having to stop them 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.570
 this polished aspartic paint can 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.990
 withstand heavy traffic and owns 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.420
 excellent chemical resistance 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.430
 the cold epoxy quickly dries 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.060
 way to allow the area to be 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.820
 put back into circulation as soon as possible 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.400
 finally the resin police party that offers to 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.580
 your soil resistant finish and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.100
 bright 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.960
 UV and weather resistant 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.970
 so this painting can also 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.980
 apply outside 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.240
 if you need a finish 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.310

 we recommend the application of 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.160
 the epoxy great maxi cold version 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 the cold epoxy is the solution 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.610
 to paint cold areas and not 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.180
 heated where other paintings do not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.180
