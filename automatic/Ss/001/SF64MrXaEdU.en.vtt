conference room here at quick logic and
i'm<00:01:35.149> using<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.049> pot<00:01:36.289> video<00:01:36.619> pico<00:01:37.039> projector

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
i'm using the pot video pico projector

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.830 
i'm using the pot video pico projector
to<00:01:37.640> project<00:01:37.969> that<00:01:38.030> image<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.719> screen

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
to project that image on the screen

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.260 
to project that image on the screen
we're<00:01:39.799> five<00:01:40.039> feet<00:01:40.340> away<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.880> we're<00:01:41.000> getting

we're five feet away and we're getting

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.090 
we're five feet away and we're getting
that<00:01:41.539> type<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.840> brightness<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.829> type<00:01:43.070> of
