00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
they're really the trying to bring back

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
they're really the trying to bring back
with<00:01:35.369> these<00:01:35.520> figures<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.450> old<00:01:36.720> feel<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
with these figures the old feel of the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.569 
with these figures the old feel of the
Kenner<00:01:37.770> figures<00:01:38.310> back<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> day<00:01:40.490> when<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
Kenner figures back in the day when the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.630 
Kenner figures back in the day when the
old<00:01:41.700> Star<00:01:42.210> Wars<00:01:42.420> figures<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.490> think<00:01:44.490> they're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
old Star Wars figures in I think they're

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
old Star Wars figures in I think they're
doing<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.000> good<00:01:45.240> job<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.960> if

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
doing a pretty good job with that if

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.469 
doing a pretty good job with that if
you're<00:01:46.259> particularly<00:01:46.920> should<00:01:47.280> junkie<00:01:48.270> you're

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
you're particularly should junkie you're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.560 
you're particularly should junkie you're
not<00:01:48.659> gonna<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.590> figures<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:51.030> simple

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
not gonna like these figures just simple

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.770 
not gonna like these figures just simple
figures<00:01:51.899> display<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.530> your<00:01:52.710> shelf<00:01:53.630> here<00:01:54.630> they

figures display on your shelf here they

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.720 
figures display on your shelf here they
are<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.799> lasat<00:01:56.219> said<00:01:58.399> great<00:01:59.399> scale

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.940 

okay<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.050> give<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.260> an<00:02:05.350> idea<00:02:05.440> of<00:02:05.830> how

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
okay just to give you an idea of how

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.560 
okay just to give you an idea of how
tall<00:02:06.010> they<00:02:06.520> are<00:02:06.550> with<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:06.970> regular<00:02:07.390> sized

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
tall they are with a regular sized

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.660 
tall they are with a regular sized
clothes<00:02:07.870> figures<00:02:08.530> they're<00:02:08.800> about<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.460> same

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
clothes figures they're about the same

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.840 
clothes figures they're about the same
height<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.760> here's<00:02:13.000> advocate<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
height so here's advocate the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.870 
height so here's advocate the
inquisitors<00:02:16.390> actually<00:02:16.690> even<00:02:16.840> taller<00:02:17.880> let's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
inquisitors actually even taller let's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.490 
inquisitors actually even taller let's
say<00:02:19.120> night<00:02:19.360> as<00:02:19.660> as<00:02:20.640> Kayden<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.630> they're<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
say night as as Kayden so they're the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.590 
say night as as Kayden so they're the
scale<00:02:23.770> wise<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.640> great<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.150> perfect

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
scale wise this is great it's perfect

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.290 
scale wise this is great it's perfect
but<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:26.440> really<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.860> articulation<00:02:27.580> that's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
but it's really the articulation that's

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.090 
but it's really the articulation that's
bumming<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:29.020> out<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.380> these<00:02:29.470> figures<00:02:29.890> but

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
bumming me out with these figures but

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.640 
bumming me out with these figures but
you<00:02:31.000> know<00:02:31.090> they<00:02:31.210> have<00:02:31.330> fantastic<00:02:31.570> detail<00:02:32.260> with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
you know they have fantastic detail with

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.170 
you know they have fantastic detail with
them<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> guess<00:02:33.459> they<00:02:33.610> do<00:02:33.730> make<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:34.030> their

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
them so I guess they do make up their

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.540 
them so I guess they do make up their
lower<00:02:34.480> price<00:02:34.780> point<00:02:35.080> but<00:02:35.320> not<00:02:35.470> low<00:02:35.830> enough<00:02:35.860> I

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
lower price point but not low enough I

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.750 
lower price point but not low enough I
think<00:02:36.940> let's<00:02:37.510> start<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.840> chopper

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
think let's start with chopper

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.190 
think let's start with chopper
articulation<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.880> go<00:02:40.000> swivel<00:02:41.670> hinge<00:02:42.670> feet

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
articulation is go swivel hinge feet

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.480 
articulation is go swivel hinge feet

forward to this figure lack of
articulation<00:05:04.550> yeah<00:05:05.580> be<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.419> as<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.600> may<00:05:06.780> I

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
articulation yeah be it as it may I

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.629 
articulation yeah be it as it may I
still<00:05:07.470> thought<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:07.889> was<00:05:08.070> gonna<00:05:08.160> be<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.310> great

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
still thought it was gonna be a great

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.060 
still thought it was gonna be a great
sculpt<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.300> did<00:05:09.479> not<00:05:09.660> disappoint<00:05:10.020> look<00:05:10.979> at

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
sculpt and it did not disappoint look at

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.540 
sculpt and it did not disappoint look at
that<00:05:12.289> just<00:05:13.289> way<00:05:13.500> she's<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:13.860> an<00:05:14.010> extra

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
that just way she's just an extra

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.790 
that just way she's just an extra
articulation<00:05:15.539> for<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.990> wrist<00:05:16.289> so<00:05:16.500> you<00:05:16.620> could

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
articulation for the wrist so you could

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.390 
articulation for the wrist so you could
swivel<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.880> mean<00:05:18.120> come<00:05:18.389> on<00:05:18.539> man<00:05:19.250> but<00:05:20.250> I'm
