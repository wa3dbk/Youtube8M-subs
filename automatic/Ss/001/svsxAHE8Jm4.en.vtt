00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 in that person critical situations 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.700
 god apparently the moment is controlled and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.920
 make decisions about the implementation of their 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.469
 Opportunities Yes But Specificity Of Our Work 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.410
 require quick turn on 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.210
 reserve body capacity 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 due to the fact that sometimes it is necessary 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.369
 sit and six hours in the car in yes 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 there is a client or object coming out we are not 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.240
 always know always blowing 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.140
 not always as planned 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 therefore often officer 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.840
 right a long time uncomfortable 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 positions naturally numb feet 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.530
 somewhere in cold conditions when the thing 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 this preparation not only works of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
 the ankle such missing not fighting 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.690
 jobs just let's say people 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.500
 have dedicated various of one or other 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.129
 professions 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.469
 before in a special situation required come out 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
 activity increased stamina 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.270
 came to the reaction and so on connect 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.079
 one hemisphere to another we increased 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 possibly 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.159
 can not double from 5 to 10 times sharply 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.390
 is increasing 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.490
 Th reactions can dramatically increase 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.220
 stress tolerance man takes 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 optimal adequate solution of many 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.939
 options for the right decisions that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.000
 arise when using two hemispheres 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.000
 brain 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.060
 physiology is the first step in mastering 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 contactless combat is the study 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.450
 physiology of human movement activity 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 which are basic elements 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.380
 technology 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 Russian hand-to-hand combat foothold 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.020
 shoulder and force interaction force 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.590
 starts with a point definition 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 the application of force direction vector and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.539
 the numerical value of the module all work 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.929
 happens in a relaxed physical and 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.039
 mental state 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:11.280
 state of complete thoughtlessness on the principle 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:17.540
 drunk who feels the power goes by 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:22.640
 the next work algorithm 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:26.310
 sensations of understanding breathing this energy 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.370
 movement generates sensation sensation 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.569
 attracts attention which is directed 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.060
 breathing and where attention goes there 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:42.049
 and energy that is possible and demand force 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.819
 first time settings are very important 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.239
 as allow 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.569
 learn to further work on full 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.569
 automat 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.280
 the first stage of the development of the ideology of the movement 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.280
 this is a speed adjustment
