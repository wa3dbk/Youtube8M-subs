00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 the lawyer of the galerinha that one day already 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 was achieved with 32 and 64 bits of the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.450
 promotional game of intel in miro sounds 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.670
 two stage foes enemies stage 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 the other kill final chacon 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.920
 are only two coupons is quiet we 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.650
 fall into the play 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 finally then gave a piece of cake for us 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.130
 after that 16 bit world that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 impossible to win 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.679
 look here to create the pip to former toni 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'm going to give some nice tips against 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.070
 voice 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 You use your copy because it's too bad. 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.820
 to change the front line with him that he 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 He shoots very fast and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.870
 Use to hit his side 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 the first die quickly but 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 of the most difficult when 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.610
 I arrived very enemy in the phase leaves a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 extra copy for them to focus on and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 hit approach catch the robots that the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 Robots are usually the most boring the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.550
 others and can still hit and run 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.500
 hit the coritiba has to run is more 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.520
 easy to kill one by one 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.299
 here in this little corner is the mini boss is a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 father has two on departure 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.689
 I tried to kill him not in the shot 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 Only what happens next will end tomorrow. 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.780
 quickie then whenever you see vi 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.890
 these spots in undue me floor 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.970
 mana only catches if it's really necessary 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.590
 because if you get full and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 wasted the rebound 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 so while he's hitting the canopy 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.750
 and took the opportunity to beat him there 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.850
 first time you will see in the match 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 and if ashes they are stationary and not 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.240
 can 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.939
 when you arrive at a non-stop 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.250
 making a room that has a lot of enemy 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.520
 will attract one by one is you do not 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.009
 run off at once a handle 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.270
 Time is killing one at a time. 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.490
 your skills avoid stealing too much 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.530
 at once if you run hard and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.170
 they will lose their reach with 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.509
 there you just down in the corner following 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.360
 avoid putting more than three faces together 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.520
 of you lose a lot of life in general 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.420
 they hit very weak but the plan did not 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.420
 loses a lot of life 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.849
 There is your clean room time you go 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.709
 see that sometimes they exchange the oe 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.140
 neighbor is there because of the demand and its 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.450
 character already gripped automatically then 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.090
 You make a hit on the net fight with 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.430
 to fight run you still get one 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.840
 time to see if it's worth to take 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.459
 or not because if you have with life 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.829
 I found a life deal 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.980
 Another cool thing is to line up enemies 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.750
 What saves you shooting here in this room? 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.510
 for example they are all just stoppages 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.829
 waiting for you to take several at once 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.290
 will help you a lot to clean this 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.299
 room that room on the way that will give 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.150
 to the procult a chief to the chief of the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.970
 forgiveness for the last sub-woods you killed 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.290
 the one over there with that gray and now I'm going 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.290
 kill this big one here 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.890
 here I started as wrong strategy 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.140
 I went to the big guy because I found 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.290
 that he would give more by giving these things and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 there I needed life and week 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 When are you going to the boss's room? 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.049
 has a hallway that was right in the middle of the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.000
 Room, I just let you go there at the end. 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.980
 You can come here and catch the human life. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.810
 if you need 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.389
 I tried to change my strategy and I saw that 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 It was working well to beat the big boss with 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.340
 the two like the honorable attacking me 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.950
 So what I did I attracted the big boss to 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.790
 out of the room and I ran there to pick up 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.709
 robot sun one at a time 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.630
 It's a bit difficult to cheer for 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.639
 they shoot very fast then 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.739
 if it is obliged to deviate from the 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.739
 to beat to divert and to beat to divert and to beat 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.609
 but you end up wasting a lot of time and 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.769
 this is always good to keep a 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.900
 in the morning for you to leave a 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:00.419
 copy and hit the back of the voice 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.200
 Robots are now 2 deaths a is very easy 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.730
 To kill this boss and Deputy Chief Forgiving is that 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.859
 You pick it up and you can pick it up. 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.090
 things they have on the floor because here already 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.349
 it will rain it will face the final shallon 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.150
 but rest assured that your life will not 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.199
 fill akino boss you will have 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.949
 opportunity 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.479
 the boss is very easy you just get 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.300
 beating there will start calling those 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.800
 millions remember tactics now 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.550
 all that you learned then if the line 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.470
 some 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.090
 They're leaving life then like me. 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.009
 invite floor picked up 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.150
 I took my copy and beat the 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.979
 the boss's will but whenever you 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.680
 Do you need anything? 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.990
 can kill the minions they always will 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.150
 leave some little things and take care 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.979
 every time the popular head out out 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.169
 Do not stay underneath it run to some 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.919
 direction here I gave here in the beginning I 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.710
 I did not know the idea of â€‹â€‹luck that I 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.419
 I had put the copy and it's there 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.150
 By calling more corn you can 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.090
 and beat him at will and then remember the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.669
 tactics do not line and shoot not for 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.180
 You save mana and they leave you 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.219
 life will leave leaving human and will 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.479
 beating well calm boss he does not give 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.440
 much damage when he hits and rebounds 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.120
 slowly 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.240
 if you want koch phase the tactic of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.370
 hit and run against it will work out 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.590
 But all the boys are leaving life. 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.650
 so there is not much need here 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:30.539
 I think more down there is worth 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:32.699
 much more worth remembering that so 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.960
 like all the other bosses remember that 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.880
 As you take some life away 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.440
 of them will increase the difficulty 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.120
 so here at the beginning he will ask that 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.440
 he will call these gags that he remembers 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.539
 that they im 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.050
 and then you 'll start to see the bugs 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.849
 more difficult 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.500
 a little stronger but there 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.599
 when there is what he called sak want 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.159
 say that you are already very weak because you 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.289
 can you do too you can stay 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.300
 waiting and killing the boys for what? 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.539
 He was calling you to increase your 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.680
 because here at this stage 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:07.580
 score is a dead animal and if 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.580
 use to kill 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.770
 I did not care about that much for myself 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.629
 I did because the score and you already closed 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.090
 the two coupons for launching the staff 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.479
 I hope I have helped that hug. 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.479
 went
