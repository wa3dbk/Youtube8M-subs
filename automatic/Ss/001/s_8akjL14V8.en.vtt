00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
the next upgrade for this technology so

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.210 
the next upgrade for this technology so
really<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.700> comparison<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.540> LTE<00:03:48.050> vs<00:03:48.710> WiMAX

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
really the comparison is LTE vs WiMAX

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.490 
really the comparison is LTE vs WiMAX
the<00:03:49.970> WiMAX<00:03:50.420> rollout<00:03:50.840> began<00:03:51.200> much<00:03:51.470> earlier

the WiMAX rollout began much earlier

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.040 
the WiMAX rollout began much earlier
than<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.190> LTE<00:03:52.670> rollout<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.840> there<00:03:54.020> are

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
than the LTE rollout so there are

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.070 
than the LTE rollout so there are
currently<00:03:54.410> more<00:03:54.500> areas<00:03:55.070> covered<00:03:55.490> with<00:03:55.640> wimax

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.960 
currently more areas covered with wimax
that<00:03:57.080> will<00:03:57.290> change<00:03:57.530> however<00:03:57.770> as<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.280> LTE

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
