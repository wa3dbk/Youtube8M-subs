00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
story or as much more as we could

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.710 
story or as much more as we could
possibly<00:03:33.159> get<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.120> freakin<00:03:34.479> trailer

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
possibly get because the freakin trailer

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.990 
possibly get because the freakin trailer
fades<00:03:35.109> to<00:03:35.290> black<00:03:35.439> like<00:03:35.769> 500<00:03:36.340> times<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.549> every

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
fades to black like 500 times like every

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.599 
fades to black like 500 times like every
single<00:03:37.449> shot<00:03:37.930> fade<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.769> black<00:03:38.949> but<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:39.400> do

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
single shot fade to black but we do

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.770 
single shot fade to black but we do
notice<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:40.000> they<00:03:40.239> are<00:03:40.449> going<00:03:40.689> through

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
notice that they are going through

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.740 
notice that they are going through
interdimensional<00:03:41.470> travel<00:03:42.430> not<00:03:42.729> space<00:03:43.269> travel

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
interdimensional travel not space travel

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.569 
interdimensional travel not space travel
so<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.229> definitely<00:03:44.590> from<00:03:44.889> my<00:03:45.099> comic<00:03:45.430> book

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
so this is definitely from my comic book

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.550 
so this is definitely from my comic book
fans<00:03:45.819> thank<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.150> guys<00:03:46.389> they<00:03:46.810> told<00:03:47.199> me<00:03:47.379> that

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
fans thank you guys they told me that

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.960 
fans thank you guys they told me that
look<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.069> really<00:03:48.400> based<00:03:48.609> on<00:03:48.729> the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
look this is really based on the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.849 
look this is really based on the
ultimate<00:03:49.540> Fantastic<00:03:49.900> Four<00:03:50.290> comics<00:03:50.709> which

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
ultimate Fantastic Four comics which

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.199 
ultimate Fantastic Four comics which
also<00:03:51.040> makes<00:03:51.310> sense<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.639> why<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:52.090> they're

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
also makes sense of why and they're

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.280 
also makes sense of why and they're
younger<00:03:52.569> as<00:03:52.780> well<00:03:52.930> because<00:03:53.169> they<00:03:53.259> were

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
younger as well because they were

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.869 
younger as well because they were
younger<00:03:53.560> in<00:03:53.769> those<00:03:53.949> comics<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:54.489> it's

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
younger in those comics so it's

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.159 
younger in those comics so it's
definitely<00:03:55.239> taking<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.659> different<00:03:55.900> approach

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
definitely taking a different approach

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.110 
definitely taking a different approach

other thing I've noticed from all the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.130 
other thing I've noticed from all the
trailers<00:04:48.790> they<00:04:48.940> release<00:04:49.300> is<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.540> they<00:04:49.900> only

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
trailers they release is that they only

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.080 
trailers they release is that they only
seem<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.530> show<00:04:50.800> a<00:04:50.830> lot<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.100> shots<00:04:51.400> from<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.790> lab

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
seem to show a lot of shots from the lab

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.670 
seem to show a lot of shots from the lab
and<00:04:52.420> a<00:04:52.510> lot<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.840> shots<00:04:53.140> from<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.500> other

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
and a lot of shots from the other

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.860 
and a lot of shots from the other
dimension<00:04:54.070> but<00:04:54.640> nothing<00:04:55.090> really<00:04:55.240> too<00:04:55.480> much<00:04:55.630> of

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
dimension but nothing really too much of

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.260 
dimension but nothing really too much of
the<00:04:56.410> Fantastic<00:04:56.980> Four<00:04:57.010> in<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.700> city<00:04:58.030> now

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
the Fantastic Four in the city now

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.820 
the Fantastic Four in the city now
normally<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.660> wouldn't<00:04:58.840> care<00:04:59.140> about<00:04:59.170> this<00:04:59.590> but

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
normally I wouldn't care about this but

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.680 
normally I wouldn't care about this but
of<00:04:59.980> course<00:05:00.100> this<00:05:00.460> is<00:05:00.580> one<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:00.760> these<00:05:00.970> it's<00:05:01.480> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
of course this is one of these it's the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.630 
of course this is one of these it's the
beginning<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.350> possible<00:05:02.830> trilogy<00:05:03.340> it's<00:05:03.520> the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
beginning of a possible trilogy it's the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.730 
beginning of a possible trilogy it's the
origin<00:05:04.030> story<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:04.900> I'm<00:05:05.050> worried<00:05:05.440> that<00:05:05.590> there

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
origin story so I'm worried that there

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.950 
origin story so I'm worried that there
might<00:05:05.950> not<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.340> lot<00:05:06.760> of<00:05:06.790> Fantastic<00:05:07.750> Four

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
might not be a lot of Fantastic Four

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.900 
might not be a lot of Fantastic Four
actually<00:05:08.590> in<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.890> city<00:05:09.100> in<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:09.670> what<00:05:09.820> I'm

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
actually in the city in this so what I'm

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.010 
actually in the city in this so what I'm
hoping<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.480> what<00:05:10.600> they're<00:05:10.720> just<00:05:10.900> showing

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
hoping is that what they're just showing

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.690 
hoping is that what they're just showing
is<00:05:11.230> maybe<00:05:11.410> like<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.740> first<00:05:11.980> half<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.490> film

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
is maybe like the first half of the film

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
is maybe like the first half of the film
like<00:05:12.910> they're<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:13.180> showing<00:05:13.300> some<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.600> the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
like they're just showing some of the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.360 
like they're just showing some of the
major<00:05:13.930> scenes<00:05:14.320> for<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.620> first<00:05:14.830> part<00:05:15.070> but<00:05:15.100> then

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
major scenes for the first part but then

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.920 
major scenes for the first part but then
there<00:05:15.520> are<00:05:15.550> more<00:05:16.090> scenes<00:05:16.420> where<00:05:16.870> the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
there are more scenes where the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.420 
there are more scenes where the
