always had is I always have to balance

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.940 
always had is I always have to balance
it<00:00:09.059> up<00:00:09.150> against<00:00:09.510> something<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.320> try<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.860> get

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
it up against something to try and get

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.430 
it up against something to try and get
it<00:00:11.070> stay<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.370> place<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.059> I've<00:00:12.900> made<00:00:13.139> this

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it stay in place so I've made this

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:39.420 
it stay in place so I've made this
simple<00:00:13.769> tripod<00:00:14.639> adapter<00:00:15.120> from<00:00:15.750> wood

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.640 

now<00:00:40.240> let's<00:00:40.450> take<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.630> closer<00:00:40.960> look<00:00:41.080> at<00:00:41.350> how<00:00:41.470> it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
now let's take a closer look at how it's

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.630 
now let's take a closer look at how it's
made

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
made

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.490 
made
you'll<00:00:42.970> see<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.360> there's<00:00:43.630> basically<00:00:44.020> two

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
you'll see that there's basically two

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.010 
you'll see that there's basically two
strips<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.950> wood<00:00:45.100> here<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.610> then<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.600> big<00:00:46.810> piece

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
strips of wood here and then a big piece

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.680 
strips of wood here and then a big piece
underneath<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.520> couple<00:00:48.730> of<00:00:48.880> spaces<00:00:49.210> here

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
underneath and a couple of spaces here

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.530 
underneath and a couple of spaces here
and<00:00:49.930> then<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.590> bolt<00:00:50.920> here<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.550> I'll<00:00:52.210> show<00:00:52.450> you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
and then a bolt here and I'll show you

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.460 
and then a bolt here and I'll show you
the<00:00:52.660> width<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:52.990> used<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.910> wood<00:00:55.150> here<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:56.260> use

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
the width I used this wood here is use

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.880 
the width I used this wood here is use
for<00:00:56.500> these<00:00:56.830> strips<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:57.670> then<00:00:58.540> I<00:00:58.630> just<00:00:58.840> cut<00:00:59.230> an

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
for these strips and then I just cut an

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.030 
for these strips and then I just cut an
area<00:01:00.340> off<00:01:00.550> this<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:01.390> make<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.660> base<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.290> then

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
area off this to make the base and then

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.760 
area off this to make the base and then
the<00:01:03.430> bit<00:01:04.089> where<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.540> tripod<00:01:05.110> screws<00:01:05.590> into

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
the bit where the tripod screws into

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.120 
the bit where the tripod screws into
it's<00:01:06.460> just<00:01:06.730> a<00:01:06.850> regular<00:01:07.210> bolt<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:08.440> all<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:08.890> did

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
it's just a regular bolt so all I did

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.840 
it's just a regular bolt so all I did
was<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.550> took<00:01:10.090> my<00:01:10.150> drill<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.840> made<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.800> hole<00:01:12.640> like

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
was I took my drill I made a hole like

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.450 
was I took my drill I made a hole like
this<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.960> around<00:01:14.470> a<00:01:14.860> little<00:01:15.100> bit<00:01:15.190> smaller

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
this just around a little bit smaller

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.700 
this just around a little bit smaller
than<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.820> size<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.180> bolt<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.660> then<00:01:17.410> I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
than the size of the bolt and then I

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.530 
than the size of the bolt and then I
felt<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.130> hole<00:01:18.310> with<00:01:18.490> some<00:01:18.610> glue<00:01:18.880> put<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
felt that hole with some glue put the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.330 
felt that hole with some glue put the
bolt<00:01:19.750> on<00:01:19.869> top<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.380> bashed<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.160> with<00:01:21.310> a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
bolt on top and bashed it in with a

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.359 
bolt on top and bashed it in with a
hammer<00:01:21.580> so<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.119> nice<00:01:22.270> tight<00:01:22.690> fit<00:01:23.369> these

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
hammer so it's a nice tight fit these

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.460 
hammer so it's a nice tight fit these
spaces<00:01:25.030> here<00:01:25.240> are<00:01:25.390> just<00:01:25.600> done<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:26.140> scrap

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
spaces here are just done some scrap

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.410 
spaces here are just done some scrap
plastic<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:27.160> I<00:01:27.190> had<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.820> they<00:01:28.180> basically

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
plastic that I had and they basically

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.870 
plastic that I had and they basically
make<00:01:29.110> sure<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.470> when<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.800> screw<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.280> tripod

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
make sure that when you screw the tripod

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.080 
make sure that when you screw the tripod
in<00:01:31.060> here<00:01:31.330> it's<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.600> nice<00:01:31.780> tight<00:01:32.170> fit<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.820> reason

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
in here it's a nice tight fit the reason

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.000 
in here it's a nice tight fit the reason
why<00:01:34.210> I've<00:01:34.360> left<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.780> screws<00:01:35.080> out<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.619> so<00:01:35.890> that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
why I've left the screws out is so that

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.450 
why I've left the screws out is so that
you<00:01:36.130> can<00:01:36.630> attach<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.930> rubber<00:01:38.259> band<00:01:38.619> around<00:01:39.040> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
you can attach a rubber band around the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.640 
you can attach a rubber band around the
phone<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.910> make<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.180> more<00:01:40.300> secure<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:41.140> you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
phone to make it more secure if you

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.790 
phone to make it more secure if you
think<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.160> or<00:01:42.310> tight<00:01:42.940> fit<00:01:43.240> isn't<00:01:43.420> good<00:01:43.720> enough

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
think the or tight fit isn't good enough

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.320 
think the or tight fit isn't good enough
