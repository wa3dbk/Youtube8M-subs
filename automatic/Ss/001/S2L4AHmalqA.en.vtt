cesaro's are going to make any excuses
but<00:07:27.169> this<00:07:27.319> is<00:07:27.439> not<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.620> way<00:07:27.800> that<00:07:27.919> was<00:07:28.039> a<00:07:28.099> 3<00:07:28.279> see

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
but this is not the way that was a 3 see

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.769 
but this is not the way that was a 3 see
it<00:07:28.580> right<00:07:28.699> there<00:07:28.729> there's<00:07:29.000> the<00:07:29.029> replay<00:07:29.360> that

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:29.779 
it right there there's the replay that

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.390 
it right there there's the replay that
was<00:07:29.960> a<00:07:29.990> three-count<00:07:30.439> no<00:07:30.949> I<00:07:30.979> think<00:07:31.069> that<00:07:31.279> was<00:07:31.370> a

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
was a three-count no I think that was a

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.100 
was a three-count no I think that was a
very<00:07:31.580> short<00:07:32.000> to<00:07:32.210> count<00:07:32.449> I<00:07:32.629> think<00:07:32.930> it<00:07:32.990> was<00:07:33.050> a

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
very short to count I think it was a

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.989 
very short to count I think it was a
very<00:07:33.229> long<00:07:33.589> two-count<00:07:33.979> actually<00:07:34.580> I<00:07:34.729> think

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:34.999 
very long two-count actually I think

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.429 
very long two-count actually I think
that<00:07:35.300> was<00:07:35.419> really<00:07:35.539> a<00:07:35.689> two-count<00:07:36.080> no<00:07:36.199> that<00:07:36.409> was

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:36.439 
that was really a two-count no that was

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.529 
that was really a two-count no that was
a<00:07:36.560> three<00:07:36.860> that<00:07:37.370> was<00:07:37.550> a<00:07:37.580> three<00:07:37.909> and<00:07:38.060> this<00:07:38.330> led<00:07:38.509> to
