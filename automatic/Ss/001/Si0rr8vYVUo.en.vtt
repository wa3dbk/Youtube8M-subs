00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
search and then you effectively just

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030

technique literally go through to the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
technique literally go through to the
59th<00:03:02.790> minute<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.210> then<00:03:03.360> pick<00:03:03.660> up<00:03:03.780> players<00:03:04.020> to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
go through cheap obviously remembering

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.120 
go through cheap obviously remembering
formation<00:03:06.390> stuff<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:08.010> can

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
formation stuff like that and you can

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.040 
formation stuff like that and you can
obviously<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> lower<00:03:09.150> scale<00:03:09.480> by<00:03:09.810> just

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
obviously do it on a lower scale by just

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.780 
obviously do it on a lower scale by just
doing<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.380> for<00:03:10.470> one<00:03:10.620> player<00:03:10.860> at<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.040> time<00:03:11.070> for

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
my proly team I probably made about

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.710 
my proly team I probably made about
three<00:04:17.489> times<00:04:17.669> as<00:04:17.820> many<00:04:17.940> coins<00:04:18.180> back<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.600> them

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.300 
three times as many coins back on them
as<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.930> first<00:04:19.109> off<00:04:19.410> because<00:04:19.650> all<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> prices<00:04:20.220> of

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
as I first off because all the prices of

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.070 
as I first off because all the prices of
players<00:04:20.489> have<00:04:20.669> gone<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:21.840> good<00:04:22.049> to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
players have gone up so it's good to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.840 
players have gone up so it's good to
invest<00:04:22.650> some<00:04:22.890> money<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.130> decent<00:04:23.640> players

invest some money in decent players

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.000 
invest some money in decent players
because<00:04:24.090> they<00:04:24.240> will<00:04:24.390> go<00:04:24.539> up<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.810> price

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
because they will go up in price

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.230 
because they will go up in price
especially<00:04:26.010> when<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.220> game<00:04:26.340> first<00:04:26.370> comes<00:04:26.850> out

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
left-back in the center back positions

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.150 
left-back in the center back positions
we<00:04:46.380> have<00:04:47.210> Campagnaro<00:04:48.210> who<00:04:48.900> has<00:04:49.139> 72<00:04:49.560> pays<00:04:49.889> he

we have Campagnaro who has 72 pays he

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.740 
we have Campagnaro who has 72 pays he
was<00:04:50.280> probably<00:04:50.580> like<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.910> third<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.419> think<00:04:51.630> it's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
was probably like the third I think it's

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.939 
was probably like the third I think it's
the<00:04:51.840> fourth<00:04:52.110> fastest<00:04:52.710> defender<00:04:53.310> on<00:04:54.500> in<00:04:55.500> Syria

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
the fourth fastest defender on in Syria

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.339 
the fourth fastest defender on in Syria
I<00:04:56.220> mean<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.669> would<00:04:56.699> like<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.180> pick<00:04:57.330> up<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:57.810> think

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
I mean I would like to pick up I think

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.339 
I mean I would like to pick up I think
it's<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:59.419> ogbonna<00:05:00.419> because<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.050> don't

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
it's and ogbonna because I just don't

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.050 
it's and ogbonna because I just don't
think<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.650> can<00:05:01.680> justify<00:05:02.190> buying<00:05:02.370> Chiellini<00:05:02.970> at

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
think I can justify buying Chiellini at

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.240 
think I can justify buying Chiellini at
this<00:05:03.150> point<00:05:03.419> in<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.599> game<00:05:03.630> and<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.860> have

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
this point in the game and I have

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.399 
this point in the game and I have
actually<00:05:05.610> got<00:05:05.849> gamberini<00:05:06.659> he's<00:05:07.110> one<00:05:07.259> of<00:05:07.349> my

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
actually got gamberini he's one of my

actually got gamberini he's one of my
favorite<00:05:07.740> players<00:05:07.919> from<00:05:08.039> fifa<00:05:08.460> 12<00:05:08.729> he<00:05:09.090> has<00:05:09.120> 78

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
favorite players from fifa 12 he has 78

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.010 
favorite players from fifa 12 he has 78
pace<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:10.169> think<00:05:10.319> I'd<00:05:10.409> banas<00:05:10.800> got<00:05:11.009> like<00:05:11.250> 80<00:05:11.490> and

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
pace I think I'd banas got like 80 and

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.649 
pace I think I'd banas got like 80 and
Chiellini<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.169> also<00:05:13.409> got<00:05:13.560> 80<00:05:13.849> at<00:05:14.849> right-back<00:05:15.210> I

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
Chiellini is also got 80 at right-back I

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.510 
Chiellini is also got 80 at right-back I
went<00:05:15.870> for<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.229> actually<00:05:16.560> got<00:05:16.830> quite<00:05:17.190> good

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
went for I actually got quite good

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.939 
went for I actually got quite good
bargain<00:05:17.970> got<00:05:18.449> a<00:05:18.479> sacar<00:05:18.840> de<00:05:19.020> for<00:05:19.259> 500<00:05:19.800> coins

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
bargain got a sacar de for 500 coins

bargain got a sacar de for 500 coins
it's<00:05:20.280> actually<00:05:20.580> going<00:05:20.849> for<00:05:21.240> more<00:05:21.389> like<00:05:21.599> ass

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
it's actually going for more like ass

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.510 
it's actually going for more like ass
out<00:05:21.990> like<00:05:22.259> the<00:05:22.440> lowest<00:05:22.650> i<00:05:22.919> think<00:05:23.130> buy<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.340> now

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
for a 433 right back is about a thousand

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.200 
for a 433 right back is about a thousand
so<00:05:25.860> I'll<00:05:25.979> easily<00:05:26.460> sell<00:05:26.639> them<00:05:26.729> on<00:05:26.849> for<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.060> lot

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210

there Muriel 91 pace in 87 dribbling he

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.490 
there Muriel 91 pace in 87 dribbling he
has<00:06:02.849> forced<00:06:03.210> our<00:06:03.360> skills<00:06:03.659> and<00:06:03.780> four-star<00:06:04.259> weak

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
has forced our skills and four-star weak

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.950 
has forced our skills and four-star weak
foot<00:06:04.800> which<00:06:05.400> looks<00:06:05.909> absolutely<00:06:06.300> insane

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
foot which looks absolutely insane

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.899 
foot which looks absolutely insane
hopefully<00:06:07.889> his<00:06:08.099> shooting<00:06:08.400> won't<00:06:08.639> let<00:06:08.819> him

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
hopefully his shooting won't let him

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.209 
hopefully his shooting won't let him
down<00:06:09.090> since<00:06:09.419> then<00:06:09.630> he<00:06:09.690> got<00:06:09.780> 76<00:06:10.319> but<00:06:10.590> I<00:06:10.770> think

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
down since then he got 76 but I think
