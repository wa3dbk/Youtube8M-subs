NOT<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.189> accident<00:01:08.400> before<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.150> drops<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
NOT here by accident before he drops a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
NOT here by accident before he drops a
stack<00:01:09.900> insert<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.100> he<00:01:11.159> only<00:01:11.400> has<00:01:11.520> one

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
stack insert so now he only has one

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.060 
stack insert so now he only has one
buddy<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.930> kill<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> over

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
buddy that he can kill over and over

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
buddy that he can kill over and over
again<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> knew<00:01:15.060> something<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.600> when<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
again now I knew something was up when I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
again now I knew something was up when I
kept<00:01:16.290> seeing<00:01:16.530> green<00:01:16.950> triangles<00:01:17.820> disappearing

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
kept seeing green triangles disappearing

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
kept seeing green triangles disappearing
from<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> top<00:01:19.080> edge<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> map<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
from the top edge of the map so I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.710 
from the top edge of the map so I
thought<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.270> come<00:01:21.420> over<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
thought I would come over and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
thought I would come over and
investigate<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> had<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> hunch<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
investigate I kind of had a hunch that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480 
investigate I kind of had a hunch that
something<00:01:24.780> strange<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
something strange was going on and I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.760 
something strange was going on and I
managed<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.030> bust<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> boosting<00:01:28.140> ring<00:01:28.350> at

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
managed to bust up the boosting ring at

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.870 
managed to bust up the boosting ring at
least<00:01:29.040> temporarily

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
least temporarily

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
least temporarily
well<00:01:30.479> boosters<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.320> boosters<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> they

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
well boosters will be boosters and they

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.149 
well boosters will be boosters and they
never<00:01:33.150> give<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.320> comes<00:01:34.560> rubble<00:01:34.829> back

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
never give up so here comes rubble back

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.890
