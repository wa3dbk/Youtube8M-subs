mods running through the effects loop of
the<00:00:55.320> superego<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> let's<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.360> started<00:00:57.629> with

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the superego and let's get started with

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.650 
the superego and let's get started with
the<00:00:57.870> video

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.760 

I<00:01:03.800> am<00:01:04.800> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.940> auto<00:01:06.330> mode<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.470> three

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
I am in the auto mode there are three

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.020 
I am in the auto mode there are three
modes<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.850> we've<00:01:09.300> got<00:01:09.330> Auto<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:11.030> momentary

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
modes in we've got Auto and momentary

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.770 
modes in we've got Auto and momentary
and<00:01:12.830> latch<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.300> go<00:01:15.390> through<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and latch and I will go through all of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:02:03.289 
and latch and I will go through all of
those<00:01:16.280> here's<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.090> auto<00:01:18.330> mode

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.230 

and<00:02:04.299> now<00:02:04.479> let's<00:02:04.750> move<00:02:05.049> on<00:02:05.439> to<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.340> momentary

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
and now let's move on to the momentary

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.070 
and now let's move on to the momentary
mode<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.880> does<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.569> as<00:02:10.899> long<00:02:11.020> as

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
mode and what that does is as long as

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.710 
mode and what that does is as long as
you're<00:02:11.260> holding<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> pedal<00:02:11.860> down<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you're holding the pedal down it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.970 
you're holding the pedal down it
captures<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:16.720> few<00:02:17.140> seconds<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.770> that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
captures just a few seconds of that

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:27.420 
captures just a few seconds of that
first<00:02:19.410> intro<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:20.620> you're<00:02:20.770> playing<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
first intro of what you're playing and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.729 
first intro of what you're playing and
now<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.120> switched<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.020> momentary<00:02:29.530> mode

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
now I'm switched on the momentary mode

00:02:29.739 --> 00:03:05.230 
now I'm switched on the momentary mode
and<00:02:30.090> let's<00:02:31.090> take<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.300> listen

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:15.470 

and<00:03:06.240> now<00:03:06.720> let's<00:03:06.960> go<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.380> latch<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:14.480> this

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
and now let's go to the latch and this

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.920 
and now let's go to the latch and this
is<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:16.350> pretty<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.190> records<00:03:17.820> notes<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.810> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
is it pretty much records notes for you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.550 
is it pretty much records notes for you
and<00:03:19.020> holds<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.350> out<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:22.080> pretty<00:03:22.260> neat

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
and holds it out and it's pretty neat

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.250 
and holds it out and it's pretty neat
let's<00:03:23.010> check<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.250> down<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:24.240> each<00:03:24.690> time<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.020> tap

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
let's check it down in each time you tap

00:03:25.260 --> 00:05:06.199 
let's check it down in each time you tap
the<00:03:25.500> pedal<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:26.400> can<00:03:26.550> add<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> different<00:03:26.940> note

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:06.209 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.509 

so<00:05:07.209> this<00:05:07.839> thing<00:05:08.079> will<00:05:08.319> do<00:05:08.589> a<00:05:08.619> whole<00:05:09.069> lot<00:05:09.249> more

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:09.519 
so this thing will do a whole lot more

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.449 
so this thing will do a whole lot more
because<00:05:09.869> you've<00:05:10.869> got<00:05:11.049> those<00:05:11.649> four<00:05:11.979> knobs<00:05:12.189> on

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:12.459 
because you've got those four knobs on

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.089 
because you've got those four knobs on
top<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:13.059> you<00:05:13.719> can<00:05:13.869> change<00:05:14.199> this<00:05:14.649> pedal<00:05:14.979> up

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
top and you can change this pedal up

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.899 
top and you can change this pedal up
like<00:05:15.309> crazy<00:05:15.989> let's<00:05:16.989> go<00:05:17.139> back<00:05:17.349> to<00:05:17.559> the<00:05:17.909> auto

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
like crazy let's go back to the auto

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:30.929 
like crazy let's go back to the auto
mode<00:05:19.209> and<00:05:27.989> I<00:05:28.989> just<00:05:29.229> turned<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.649> drum<00:05:29.949> knob

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
mode and I just turned the drum knob

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.519 
mode and I just turned the drum knob
down<00:05:31.299> and<00:05:31.689> we're<00:05:32.649> just<00:05:32.739> gonna<00:05:32.889> get<00:05:33.039> pure<00:05:33.429> pedal

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
down and we're just gonna get pure pedal

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:48.059 
down and we're just gonna get pure pedal
pure<00:05:35.529> wet<00:05:35.709> signal<00:05:46.229> now<00:05:47.229> let's<00:05:47.469> turn<00:05:47.649> the<00:05:47.829> rest

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
pure wet signal now let's turn the rest

00:05:48.069 --> 00:06:17.100 
pure wet signal now let's turn the rest
of<00:05:48.249> them<00:05:48.339> down<00:06:13.439> now<00:06:14.439> let's<00:06:14.649> turn<00:06:14.889> back<00:06:15.599> the<00:06:16.599> wet

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
of them down now let's turn back the wet

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:29.879 
of them down now let's turn back the wet

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.209 

and<00:06:30.889> I<00:06:31.159> turn<00:06:31.429> the<00:06:31.459> Gliss<00:06:31.909> up<00:06:32.119> quite<00:06:32.599> a<00:06:32.629> bit<00:06:32.869> and

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
and I turn the Gliss up quite a bit and

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.979
