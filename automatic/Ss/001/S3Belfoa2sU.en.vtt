00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 flat asphalt road 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.200
 maximum efficiency at 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.390
 moving 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.090
 compactness for parking at minimum 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.429
 Piglet and finally environmental friendliness 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.929
 electromotor oh hybrids will soon be forced out 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.599
 permanently engines internal 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.820
 combustion against the background of these two trends 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.820
 car large dough auto panorama 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.490
 seem like the latest magic 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 we are those who in peacetime keeps 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.710
 tomahawk sharp in case of war before before 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 us 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.559
 real big frame SUVs with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.649
 huge hearts motors for them 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.739
 word asphalt or fuel saving it 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.890
 as for the real Indian word 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.950
 pale-faced 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 the task of our test is to prove that nissan 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430
 patrol 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.739
 and toyota land cruiser 200 can do a lot 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.160
 Looks fresh and so today us 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.050
 got on the test toyota land cruiser 200 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.760
 2012 release 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.530
 luxury exterior grade from 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.480
 predecessor practically nothing 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.820
 the only thing different is the headlights 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 LED strips were added and so 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.570
 it is still solid stylish 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.030
 impressive SUV sort of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.189
 official king of the roads 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.979
 however, the main difference inside and the first 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.780
 what catches the eye is a large 8 inch 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.330
 touch monitor onboard computer 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.369
 on which, if necessary, served 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.930
 information from four external cameras 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.369
 review 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.470
 changed the dashboard a between 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.750
 speedometer and tachometer appeared 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 small color display on which 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
 actual information is displayed 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.509
 climate control is now 4 zone even in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.280
 basic configuration 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.890
 a chair of the first and second rows 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.229
 equipped with electric drive and in 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 the rest of the equipment level is impressive 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.810
 options list barely fits on the sheet 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 a4 format from the very first seconds in the chair 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 driver understand class 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 affiliation of this car and this 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.820
 involuntarily makes promises 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.460
 but the king and to deal with all 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 electronics you will need no more than 5 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.330
 minutes faster higher stronger this phrase as 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.700
 can not better fit nissan patrol 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.920
 after all, even against the backdrop of a monumental land 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.440
 cruiser he looks huge 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.080
 and he's like a toyota made in the country 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.180
 where is the average height of a man 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.040
 165 centimeters nissan patrol has always been 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.870
 the biggest road builders of companies and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.820
 grow from generation to generation to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.650
 this year it has become truly huge 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.050
 look at my height a little more than a meter 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.390
 ninety and the hood gave stand on par 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.000
 chest and in order to climb into the salon 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.959
 the steps there are not for beauty i have to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.720
 use them 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.730
 sitting in the driver's seat you will not succeed 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.040
 wake up with a dormant passenger 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.739
 nudging him between you 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 there is an armrest a refrigerator 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.420
 almost half a meter wide to communicate with 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.550
 passengers of the third row of seats in general 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.030
 perhaps it would be convenient to use 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.260
 email inside the car 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.440
 the splendor of polished wood 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.590
 expensive skin 12 speakers audio system 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.650
 get behind the wheel start the engine though no 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.140
 for starters turn on the car with 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 pressing the start button comes to life instrument 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.540
 hood panel roars out 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 petrol 400 strong eight click on 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.540
 gas and immediately exceed acceleration speed 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.570
 up to a hundred takes 6 and 6 seconds 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 the indicator is not available to everyone 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.000
 business sedan 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
 and thanks to good sound insulation 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.290
 hydraulic system limits 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.450
 body vibrations actively extinguish tea 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.860
 swinging and roll in corners set 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.170
 speeds occur as well 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.019
 at ease as in a passenger car 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.200
 in motion 200 showed itself quite 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.430
 not bad avalanche of torque 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.010
 v-shaped turbo diesel eights 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.350
 volume of 4 and a half liters through 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.950
 6 speed automatic is transmitted to 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.040
 wheels 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.930
 bringing a heavy SUV 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.030
 accelerates with the pressure of the locomotive she 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.519
 dispersal to hundreds spends only eight with 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.550
 half seconds but if on a straight land 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.470
 cruiser looks nice then turns 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.900
 clearly not his steppe from the frame 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.120
 SUV dependent rear suspension 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.420
 No one waited for reference handling 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.430
 but where roads end hardly 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.570
 Does anyone say that soft suspension with 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.660
 huge moves 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.300
 lack of day tests of the breakdown we are so 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.470
 never felt 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.049
 geometrical permeability is also on 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.650
 level entry and exit angles are enough 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.810
 big 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.390
 a ground clearance of 22 and a half 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.250
 centimeters besides stabilizers 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.050
 lateral stability are able 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.390
 dissolve hence and 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.670
 diagonal hanging is now not at all 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.190
 however terrible the tests yet 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.950
 there was a feeling that on Toyota 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.750
 she herself will not go appeared 20 seconds and 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.570
 so much time was gone 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.010
 it took to block 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.170
 center differential and enable 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.850
 downshift before 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.680
 land cruiser without help 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.360
 got out of a half meter ditch 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.070
 having driven us into the mud and ditches of patrol 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.080
 understood that tulle and stayed 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.000
 SUV with a classic frame 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.669
 construction capable of assault and 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.570
 serious off-road assignment in all 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.410
 he is not going to save in any way 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.080
 all wheel independent suspension 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.600
 He showed excellent articulation and 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.380
 We only managed to hang out the rear wheel 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.450
 once 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.710
 yes it is thanks to the blocked y 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.750
 rear differential 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.540
 patrol did not pay this annoying 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.220
 misunderstanding of any attention 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.440
 keep climbing straight up 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.960
 slope smoothness was also on 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.330
 the height of the already mentioned system 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.210
 roll stabilization instantly extinguished 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.940
 shock effort from particularly terrible bumps not 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.040
 allowing breakdown in the suspension and yet he 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.440
 we were left with the impression of ourselves rather 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.510
 as a cruise rather than off-road 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.169
 cars let's sum up our 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.520
 big dough before us real 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.890
 uncompromising SUVs both 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.020
 car ready not only confidently and 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.760
 quickly move the owner on the autobahn 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.550
 but absolutely no effort 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.030
 hold it without stain lacquered 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.460
 the shoe is where the concept of roads is 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.190
 there is a very conditional behind 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.480
 land cruiser seven generations 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.920
 enhancements and legendary name 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.770
 off-road explorer 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.840
 patrol is a real spaceship 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.920
 which is currently being tested 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.140
 ordinary roads 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.870
 but surely sometime and bears 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.630
 its passengers space test pilots cars 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.460
 panoramas sing the hymn of joy to the fact that 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.190
 the last Mohicans of the real 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.250
 SUVs are alive and no matter what 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.120
 building is over half a century yes yes you 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.360
 not misheard 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.520
 these cars for sixty years build patrol 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.960
 and the cruiser is the best cars for 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.660
 asphalt and off-road 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.870
 and hybrids electric cars let them live 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.340
 but in another dimension other than 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.640
 real cars 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.640
 a and
