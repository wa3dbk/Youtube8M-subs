okay welcome back it's finished um you
can<00:00:14.230> just<00:00:14.379> have<00:00:14.589> a<00:00:14.619> quick<00:00:14.799> preview<00:00:15.039> of<00:00:15.279> it<00:00:15.459> sooo

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
can just have a quick preview of it sooo

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.569 
can just have a quick preview of it sooo
so<00:00:16.660> this<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.560> kind<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.829> what<00:00:17.919> it<00:00:18.039> looks<00:00:18.220> like

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:20.579 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.370 

obviously<00:00:21.579> you<00:00:21.699> can<00:00:21.849> refine<00:00:22.150> this<00:00:22.390> I<00:00:22.689> probably

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
obviously you can refine this I probably

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.260 
obviously you can refine this I probably
shouldn't<00:00:23.919> have<00:00:24.009> done<00:00:24.189> what<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:24.849> did<00:00:24.939> with<00:00:25.180> the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
shouldn't have done what I did with the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.859 
shouldn't have done what I did with the
circle<00:00:25.689> because<00:00:26.339> it's<00:00:27.339> kind<00:00:27.670> of<00:00:27.869> that's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
circle because it's kind of that's

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.270 
circle because it's kind of that's
completely<00:00:29.820> unnecessary<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:31.089> do<00:00:31.240> but<00:00:32.280> because

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
completely unnecessary to do but because

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.060 
completely unnecessary to do but because
I'm<00:00:33.670> random<00:00:34.120> I<00:00:34.239> felt<00:00:34.480> like<00:00:34.629> doing<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:34.989> it<00:00:35.829> does

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
I'm random I felt like doing it it does

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.979 
I'm random I felt like doing it it does
look<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.339> bit<00:00:36.370> bizarre<00:00:36.640> probably<00:00:37.629> because<00:00:37.839> what

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
look a bit bizarre probably because what

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.450 
look a bit bizarre probably because what
I've<00:00:38.079> done<00:00:38.230> with<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.410> circle<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.250> kind<00:00:39.370> of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
I've done with the circle it's kind of

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
I've done with the circle it's kind of
defined<00:00:39.820> gravity<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:40.300> but<00:00:40.659> regardless<00:00:41.559> um

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
defined gravity that but regardless um

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.660 
defined gravity that but regardless um
so<00:00:44.020> what's<00:00:44.260> pretty<00:00:44.500> cool<00:00:44.680> about<00:00:44.800> this<00:00:45.280> method

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
so what's pretty cool about this method

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.270 
so what's pretty cool about this method
anyway<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.059> way<00:00:46.149> I<00:00:46.180> do<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.930> you're<00:00:47.920> done<00:00:48.100> in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
anyway the way I do it is you're done in

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.770 
anyway the way I do it is you're done in
realflow<00:00:48.489> now<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:48.879> don't<00:00:49.270> need<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.480> export

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
realflow now you don't need to export

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.139 
realflow now you don't need to export
anything<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.289> go<00:00:50.590> back<00:00:50.739> at<00:00:50.859> cinema<00:00:51.160> 4d<00:00:51.370> just

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
anything you go back at cinema 4d just

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.110 
anything you go back at cinema 4d just
close<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.129> need<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.340> do<00:00:54.489> now<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:54.850> go

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
close that all you need to do now is go

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.750 
close that all you need to do now is go
to<00:00:55.180> plugins<00:00:55.449> next<00:00:56.199> limit<00:00:56.500> mesh<00:00:57.070> loader<00:00:57.340> that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
to plugins next limit mesh loader that

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.660 
to plugins next limit mesh loader that
are<00:00:58.269> then<00:00:58.840> you<00:00:58.930> get<00:00:59.079> an<00:00:59.199> object<00:00:59.559> here<00:00:59.800> nothing

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
are then you get an object here nothing

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.099 
are then you get an object here nothing
happens<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.300> know<00:01:01.390> it's<00:01:01.539> a<00:01:01.570> bit<00:01:01.660> like<00:01:01.780> oh<00:01:01.989> my

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
happens to know it's a bit like oh my

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.100 
happens to know it's a bit like oh my
god<00:01:02.820> anyway<00:01:03.820> so<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:04.119> wanna<00:01:04.239> hit<00:01:04.330> sequence<00:01:04.839> and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
god anyway so you wanna hit sequence and

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.230 
god anyway so you wanna hit sequence and
then<00:01:05.199> it's<00:01:05.410> a<00:01:05.440> bin<00:01:05.740> file<00:01:06.070> sequence<00:01:06.610> just<00:01:06.910> click

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
then it's a bin file sequence just click

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.410 
then it's a bin file sequence just click
on<00:01:07.360> little<00:01:07.630> three<00:01:08.289> dots<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:10.000> you're

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
on little three dots and then you're

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.880 
on little three dots and then you're
going<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.570> want<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.750> go<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:11.380> your<00:01:11.530> user<00:01:11.770> name

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
going to want to go to your user name

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.040 
going to want to go to your user name
this<00:01:12.190> works<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.610> Windows<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.030> Mac<00:01:13.330> then<00:01:13.929> you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
this works on Windows and Mac then you

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.749 
this works on Windows and Mac then you
want<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.259> go<00:01:14.349> into<00:01:14.500> scenes<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:16.090> want<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.330> go<00:01:16.450> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
want to go into scenes you want to go to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:26.550 
want to go into scenes you want to go to
where<00:01:18.759> they<00:01:18.880> gone<00:01:19.090> now<00:01:23.310> bath<00:01:25.200> don't<00:01:26.200> work

where they gone now bath don't work

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.350 
where they gone now bath don't work
minds<00:01:26.860> on<00:01:26.979> but<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.369> should<00:01:27.580> just<00:01:27.670> say<00:01:27.819> bathtub

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
minds on but it should just say bathtub

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.529 
minds on but it should just say bathtub
but<00:01:28.630> mine's<00:01:28.869> been<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> bit<00:01:29.349> daft<00:01:30.479> anyway<00:01:31.479> you

want<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.869> go<00:01:32.020> what<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.679> name<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.069> file

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
want to just go what you name the file

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.010 
want to just go what you name the file
and<00:01:33.550> then<00:01:33.610> measures<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.390> then<00:01:34.660> just<00:01:34.840> wanna

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and then measures and then just wanna

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.410 
and then measures and then just wanna
click<00:01:35.259> on<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.470> first<00:01:35.649> mesh<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.190> hit<00:01:36.310> open<00:01:36.489> so

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
click on the first mesh and hit open so

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.089 
click on the first mesh and hit open so
now<00:01:37.450> if<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:37.810> hit<00:01:38.020> play<00:01:38.259> don't<00:01:38.649> got<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.890> lot<00:01:38.950> done

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
now if we hit play don't got a lot done

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:44.820 
now if we hit play don't got a lot done
papa<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:41.259> have<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.940> animated<00:01:42.940> mesh<00:01:43.539> all<00:01:44.349> worked

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
papa we have a animated mesh all worked

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.749 
papa we have a animated mesh all worked
out<00:01:44.979> for<00:01:45.039> us<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.759> we<00:01:45.789> can<00:01:46.090> all<00:01:46.209> be<00:01:46.330> lazy<00:01:46.539> bums<00:01:46.840> um

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
out for us so we can all be lazy bums um

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.770 
out for us so we can all be lazy bums um
now<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.090> what<00:01:49.300> I<00:01:49.330> was<00:01:49.479> learning<00:01:49.599> about

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
now this is what I was learning about

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.510 
now this is what I was learning about
where<00:01:50.050> it's<00:01:50.170> an<00:01:50.259> import<00:01:50.709> scale<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.220> just

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
where it's an import scale I just

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.570 
where it's an import scale I just
changed<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.060> northpoint<00:01:52.390> 95<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.280> reason

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
changed it to northpoint 95 the reason

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.029 
changed it to northpoint 95 the reason
being<00:01:54.610> if<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:55.450> play<00:01:55.629> this<00:01:55.810> back<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.679> just

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
being if I just play this back it just

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.650 
being if I just play this back it just
seems<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.369> fit<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.759> little<00:01:58.060> better<00:01:58.239> in<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.509> bar

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
seems to fit a little better in the bar

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.479 
seems to fit a little better in the bar
top<00:01:59.849> to<00:02:00.849> me<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:02.170> just<00:02:02.229> matches<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.009> geometry

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
top to me it just matches the geometry

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.889 
top to me it just matches the geometry
the<00:02:03.610> bots<00:02:03.759> have<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.030> little<00:02:04.539> bit<00:02:04.690> better<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.810> if

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
the bots have a little bit better so if

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.309 
the bots have a little bit better so if
we<00:02:08.050> if<00:02:08.349> we<00:02:08.410> were<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.770> just<00:02:08.979> quickly<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.789> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
we if we were to just quickly do a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.820 
we if we were to just quickly do a
render<00:02:11.819> all<00:02:12.819> well<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.270> good<00:02:13.330> but<00:02:13.629> Dad<00:02:14.620> does

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
render all well and good but Dad does

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.740 
render all well and good but Dad does
not<00:02:15.010> look<00:02:15.129> like<00:02:15.190> water<00:02:15.580> now<00:02:16.090> there's<00:02:16.390> two<00:02:16.599> ways

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
not look like water now there's two ways

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.380 
not look like water now there's two ways
you<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:17.050> do<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.200> one<00:02:18.450> so

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
you can do this one so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.540 
you can do this one so
the<00:02:20.660> first<00:02:20.870> way<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.110> can<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.620> which<00:02:22.069> will

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
the first way you can do it which will

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.280 
the first way you can do it which will
work<00:02:22.790> for<00:02:23.180> everyone<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.020> go<00:02:24.140> into

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
work for everyone is if you go into

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.380 
work for everyone is if you go into
cinema<00:02:24.650> 4d<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.670> comes<00:02:25.880> with<00:02:25.970> all<00:02:26.209> versions

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
cinema 4d this comes with all versions

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.600 
cinema 4d this comes with all versions
of<00:02:26.660> cinema<00:02:27.080> 4d<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.590> nice<00:02:27.830> if<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.250> don't<00:02:28.430> have

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
of cinema 4d so nice if you don't have

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.030 
of cinema 4d so nice if you don't have
this<00:02:28.850> then<00:02:29.290> you've<00:02:30.290> got<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> problem<00:02:30.590> anyway

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this then you've got a problem anyway

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.120 
this then you've got a problem anyway
you<00:02:31.100> want<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:31.340> into<00:02:31.430> basic<00:02:32.020> then<00:02:33.020> scroll<00:02:33.950> up

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
you want to go into basic then scroll up

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.670 
you want to go into basic then scroll up
and<00:02:34.459> then<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.060> these<00:02:35.600> three<00:02:35.810> glass<00:02:36.110> ones<00:02:36.440> work

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
and then you these three glass ones work

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.150 
and then you these three glass ones work
well<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.190> personally<00:02:37.970> like<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.100> we

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
well I personally like that one so if we

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.550 
well I personally like that one so if we
then<00:02:40.430> drop<00:02:40.820> this<00:02:41.000> onto<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.390> water<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:42.050> then

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
then drop this onto the water and then

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.090 
then drop this onto the water and then
render<00:02:43.630> we've<00:02:44.630> got<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> little<00:02:44.990> bit<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.380> a

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
render we've got a little bit of a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.420 
render we've got a little bit of a
watery<00:02:46.850> look<00:02:47.890> then<00:02:48.890> before<00:02:49.520> we<00:02:50.200> zoom<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.430> you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
watery look then before we zoom in you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.729 
watery look then before we zoom in you
see<00:02:52.670> it's<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.970> little<00:02:53.450> bit<00:02:53.570> more<00:02:53.720> watery<00:02:54.200> kind

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
see it's a little bit more watery kind

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.880 
see it's a little bit more watery kind
of<00:02:54.920> more<00:02:55.850> realistic<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.780> we<00:02:57.410> can<00:02:57.560> go<00:02:57.680> one

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
of more realistic but we can go one

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.710 
of more realistic but we can go one
better<00:02:58.070> because<00:02:58.459> yet<00:02:58.700> again<00:02:58.730> if<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.209> if<00:02:59.390> you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
better because yet again if you if you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.479 
better because yet again if you if you
were<00:02:59.870> able<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.260> get<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.590> bathtub<00:03:00.920> you'll<00:03:01.370> be

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
were able to get that bathtub you'll be

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.040 
were able to get that bathtub you'll be
able<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.730> get<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:02.090> because<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
able to get this because in the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.150 
able to get this because in the
architecture<00:03:03.590> addition<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.010> grow

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
architecture addition if you grow

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.690 
architecture addition if you grow
materials<00:03:04.700> not<00:03:05.150> nearly<00:03:05.750> make<00:03:06.500> natural<00:03:06.830> nature

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
materials not nearly make natural nature

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.970 
materials not nearly make natural nature
excuse<00:03:08.209> me<00:03:08.360> then<00:03:09.200> you've<00:03:09.320> actually<00:03:09.470> got<00:03:09.709> water

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
excuse me then you've actually got water

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.490 
excuse me then you've actually got water
pool<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.550> says<00:03:10.730> animated<00:03:11.420> doesn't<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.320> much

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
pool it says animated doesn't do much

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500 
pool it says animated doesn't do much
though<00:03:12.739> um<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.030> going<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.330> want<00:03:14.480> to

though um so just going to want to

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.240 
though um so just going to want to
delete<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.870> material<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.620> just<00:03:15.890> drop<00:03:16.100> it

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
delete the material you can just drop it

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.949 
delete the material you can just drop it
on<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.580> will<00:03:16.670> overwrite<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> material<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:17.690> I

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
on and will overwrite the material but I

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.680 
on and will overwrite the material but I
just<00:03:18.440> do<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.590> for<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.800> keepsake<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:20.390> when<00:03:20.540> we

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
just do it for a keepsake so now when we

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.800 
just do it for a keepsake so now when we
render<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.080> out<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:21.830> looking<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:23.120> my<00:03:23.510> opinion

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
render it out it's looking in my opinion

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.990 
render it out it's looking in my opinion
quite<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.530> lot<00:03:24.680> better<00:03:24.829> than<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.190> glass<00:03:25.400> all

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
quite a lot better than the glass all

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.910 
quite a lot better than the glass all
the<00:03:26.329> blood<00:03:26.540> although<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.079> glass<00:03:27.290> does<00:03:27.620> work

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the blood although the glass does work

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.650 
the blood although the glass does work
quite<00:03:28.220> well<00:03:29.140> um<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:32.060> other<00:03:32.239> than<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.510> I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
quite well um but other than that I

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.039 
quite well um but other than that I
suppose<00:03:33.079> you<00:03:33.290> could<00:03:33.560> do<00:03:34.120> excuse<00:03:35.120> me<00:03:35.269> you<00:03:35.840> could

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
suppose you could do excuse me you could

suppose you could do excuse me you could
make<00:03:36.170> your<00:03:36.380> own<00:03:36.500> texture<00:03:37.010> but<00:03:37.730> I'm<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.090> to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
what I wanted to do a preview just hold

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.670 
what I wanted to do a preview just hold
out<00:03:46.430> hit<00:03:46.730> make<00:03:46.940> preview<00:03:47.420> I'm<00:03:48.200> going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> do

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
out hit make preview I'm going to do

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.140 
out hit make preview I'm going to do
mine<00:03:48.860> a<00:03:48.890> bit<00:03:49.100> bigger<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.459> I'm<00:03:49.760> going<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:49.970> do

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
mine a bit bigger so I'm going to do

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.030 
mine a bit bigger so I'm going to do
mine<00:03:50.420> um<00:03:50.840> let's<00:03:51.769> think<00:03:52.070> for<00:03:53.709> Freddy<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.860> think

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
mine um let's think for Freddy I think

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.530 
mine um let's think for Freddy I think
it<00:03:55.130> adds<00:03:55.250> for<00:03:55.670> Eddie<00:03:56.320> is<00:03:57.320> kind<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.799> SD<00:03:58.579> so<00:03:59.480> I'm

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it adds for Eddie is kind of SD so I'm

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.289 
it adds for Eddie is kind of SD so I'm
going<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.720> do<00:03:59.810> for<00:03:59.989> 80<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.730> you'll<00:04:02.209> see

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
going to do for 80 and so you'll see

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.210 
going to do for 80 and so you'll see
here<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.840> your<00:04:02.989> progress<00:04:03.410> but<00:04:03.829> I'm<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.040> going

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
here is your progress but I'm just going

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.069

should<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.080> say<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.320> cube<00:04:44.740> then<00:04:45.190> have<00:04:45.430> walk<00:04:45.669> to

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
should I say a cube then have walk to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.610 
should I say a cube then have walk to
emit<00:04:46.600> on<00:04:46.810> top<00:04:46.990> of<00:04:47.139> that<00:04:47.229> and<00:04:47.320> then<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.530> will

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
emit on top of that and then it will

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.189 
emit on top of that and then it will
fall<00:04:47.830> apart<00:04:48.100> but<00:04:48.280> this<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.060> kind<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.050> how

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.010 
fall apart but this is just kind of how
