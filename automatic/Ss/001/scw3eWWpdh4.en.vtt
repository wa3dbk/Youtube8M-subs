00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello to all and all 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.780
 today so in this video I 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.010
 showed you how to put your 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.619
 sim card in micro sim so transformed 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.489
 a sim card of basic type in card 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.679
 sim micro-sim good for iphone 4 on 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.679
 look at it right after the jingle 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 and 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.270
 so as I wanted to said just before the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.140
 jingle i'm going to show you so how 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.710
 put a normal sim card into a microphone 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.350
 sim 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.110
 So here is a micro sim so it's 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.369
 very simple to do we must have the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.750
 courage to do that what a guy who 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.420
 do not have the courage dilou always afraid 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.430
 but hey it's easy in fact basically 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 will have to get in the caf will have to take 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.180
 have a micro-sim of course and a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.830
 sim card she wanted to do 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.300
 so that it can be found you want 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.850
 even went in 20's 20's made a noise 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.259
 orange gains where our country and ask 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.820
 a micro-sim just let him get you there 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.340
 and you bring a chisel and you 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 do at the same time with the video 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.259
 so you take this micro sim 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.970
 you get it back in the sim card and we 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.490
 will cut and after of course we want 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.500
 to do with the pen we will do the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.920
 extremes we know if you really have 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.690
 fear 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.310
 take a small marker you do the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.789
 ends me I do not see too much 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.890
 usefulness 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.979
 after they go on the internet microphones 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.190
 China therefore smart sim with the plane 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.110
 that we can cut and here I am 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.700
 not do it with it is useless then 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.860
 after things for when she is in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.100
 sim put it back in normal sim card 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.259
 So here is here you go so 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.350
 firstly you take the esteem card 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.790
 worth the man was down so before 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.120
 and then you take the new target map 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.660
 and you put it on the side where there is the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.390
 small the little thing as if you 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:30.079
 returned here well in the posture of a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.329
 side when she is back in the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.970
 side you try to see a little bit like 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.930
 assembly relative to Russia 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.940
 we're going to listen to them so I 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.650
 will try to show you how that 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.650
 is happening so 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.140
 So here I am already cut the small 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:04.140
 here after we will cut his little use 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:11.760
 so it is by this word to make him believe 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:14.090
 cutouts all that serves so here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.290
 we had to cut out airlock and that's normal 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.650
 now we're going to help her doll the other 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.650
 end so the little end there 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.020
 fell it does not matter 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.970
 then here we see that we still have one 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.350
 little side cut we will go the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 cuts and a girl and a little brim 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.150
 red that cut you off and so that's the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.860
 last butt and cut here so here on 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.300
 see we have the micro sim that come in 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.120
 perfectly with the new target 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.720
 like these and we will test them in 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.150
 the Iphone 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.880
 these paretics so first of all we take 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.370
 little so that this little puppy 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.740
 comes with the iphone 4 including 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.250
 the art comes in here in the little blond the 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:03.420
 little trot and like to see the map 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.900
 and simon voice so here open it here on 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.290
 will have our little fleet this lot on 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.040
 will go into your new 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.049
 So here we did the if you see 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
 that she does not fit in well you cut her 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.739
 sama me it can happen to me 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.190
 so here we see that she is too 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.930
 Too big in this case 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.200
 cut the little red edge that is of 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.200
 too much 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:45.500
 here we cut we will try the 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:48.830
 back in we see that there is an edge 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.400
 yet they not fit here too 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.110
 the return perfectly that the little 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.449
 edge is badly done so you cut it 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:04.310
 there is a small edge in addition we see that 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:05.780
 dolls yet here are made 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.660
 be careful not to cut out the circus 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.090
 printed otherwise your card is dead there 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.210
 you will have to ask your operator 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.990
 a new map 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.160
 and that's a little more annoying so there 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.780
 we're going back to school 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.940
 it's a little hard believe I cut 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.770
 not enough red edge so we go to them 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.570
 cut 1 to really make it ok 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:36.380
 the end the red edge so we go there 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:39.919
 to go to be really ready befits this 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.889
 that if not that can voila voila 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:46.550
 never so here we go back to school I think 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:51.620
 that there are the good here is the big 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.510
 perfectly you will see that you 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.430
 see a little space here but it's 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.530
 not serious because the important thing is 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.120
 what to do then you're doing 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.409
 for you to be cut each time the 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.289
 edges see that it does not really fit 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.159
 there but never cut the circuit 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.380
 printed is what is most 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.280
 important 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.550
 so we'll try to get back to school 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.550
 in there we'll go then get in 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.349
 here we see maps and if the 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:20.999
 unlock and so we see that she 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:26.309
 walk after there is a code I think that 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:28.619
 it's 4 to 0 basic here it's not 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:31.739
 targets stuck but the sim card works 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:32.939
 impeccably so here I hope that 

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.399
 in this video you understood 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.569
 how to cut a sim card after it 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.269
 are several things that sit on 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.659
 the net like this micro target like this 

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.579
 site 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.559
 seitz martin who buy themselves on 

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:45.299
 sites then here I hope you have 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.979
 well understood if you can not do it 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:48.869
 you can always ask me where we 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.709
 find it on the comments or if 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:51.809
 you have a problem 

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:54.509
 that was after lisa pro for the 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:56.659
 site ap the bitter to fr point go to the 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:56.659
 next
