 taken from the board's front brake discs 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.339

 Here you can see the new brake pad on the left with a lot of paint compared to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 old pad on the right of the chest of drawers has 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.939
 To prevent the new trends, CAD presents both seduction 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.250
 Carefully wipe off the edges of the brake pads 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.000

 8th 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 ste 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.630
 then they took the back of the trend-setting missed games 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.909

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.799
 People focus on the brake pads otherwise extreme and braking power 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.799

 could slow down 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.049
 then the boxes were stuck way back in the current year 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.049
