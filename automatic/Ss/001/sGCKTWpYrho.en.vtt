is<00:00:41.980> 12<00:00:42.220> seconds<00:00:42.610> 14<00:00:42.910> seconds<00:00:43.300> 16<00:00:43.420> seconds<00:00:43.930> if<00:00:44.019> I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
is 12 seconds 14 seconds 16 seconds if I

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.049 
is 12 seconds 14 seconds 16 seconds if I
change<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.470> measures<00:00:45.269> it<00:00:46.269> says<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.610> the

the<00:00:53.260> kind<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.500> thing<00:00:53.590> we<00:00:53.680> need<00:00:53.710> when<00:00:53.950> we<00:00:53.980> either

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
the kind of thing we need when we either

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.680 
the kind of thing we need when we either
take<00:00:54.370> this<00:00:54.760> place<00:00:55.000> rather<00:00:55.239> see<00:00:55.420> if<00:00:55.510> we<00:00:55.570> can

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
take this place rather see if we can

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.880 
take this place rather see if we can
identify<00:00:56.050> where<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.559> problem<00:00:56.770> is<00:00:56.829> because

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
identify where the problem is because

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:09.060 
identify where the problem is because
it'd<00:00:57.129> probably<00:00:57.219> be<00:00:57.430> really<00:00:57.670> obvious

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.460 

ah<00:01:09.100> okay<00:01:10.090> now<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.690> what<00:01:10.930> needs<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.320> hit

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
ah okay now this is what needs to hit

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.940 
ah okay now this is what needs to hit
them<00:01:11.880> those<00:01:12.880> two<00:01:13.120> notes<00:01:13.330> there<00:01:13.720> need<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.470> be<00:01:14.620> on

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
them those two notes there need to be on

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.980 
them those two notes there need to be on
that<00:01:15.130> big<00:01:15.370> line<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.659> will<00:01:16.750> probably

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
that big line and that will probably

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.690 
that big line and that will probably
sound<00:01:17.320> pretty<00:01:17.500> good<00:01:17.560> I'm<00:01:17.890> going<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.130> copy<00:01:18.400> that
