bit<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:33.420> clarity<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.890> side<00:01:35.159> which

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
bit more clarity on the right side which

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
bit more clarity on the right side which
is<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> course<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> LG<00:01:36.299> g3<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> left

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is of course the LG g3 and on the left

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
is of course the LG g3 and on the left
side<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> g2<00:01:38.220> while<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> does<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
side the g2 while it does have a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
side the g2 while it does have a
respectable<00:01:39.210> pixel<00:01:39.960> density<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> its<00:01:40.590> own<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
respectable pixel density of its own the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
respectable pixel density of its own the
higher<00:01:41.130> resolution<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> g3<00:01:42.299> obviously

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
higher resolution of the g3 obviously

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.770 
higher resolution of the g3 obviously
allows<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.560> even<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.189> packed<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
allows for even more to be packed in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
allows for even more to be packed in
alright<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.810> i<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.170> move<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:47.070> video

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
alright and i will move on to some video

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.679 
alright and i will move on to some video
now<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> course<00:01:48.180> you're<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> be

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
them even more on this larger screen and

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.020 
them even more on this larger screen and
finally<00:02:04.860> here's<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> look<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.369> some<00:02:05.579> text

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
finally here's a look at some text

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.089 
finally here's a look at some text
zoomed<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.960> chrome<00:02:07.259> browser<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.770> went

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
zoomed in on the chrome browser I went

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
zoomed in on the chrome browser I went
ahead<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.429> zoomed<00:02:08.729> right<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
ahead and just zoomed right on into the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.869 
ahead and just zoomed right on into the
text<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:11.129> see<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.670> one

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
text on here and you can see that on one

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.200 
text on here and you can see that on one
side<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.150> still<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
side you still have a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.090 
side you still have a
very<00:02:13.360> good<00:02:13.780> pixel<00:02:14.140> density<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.500> allows<00:02:14.830> for

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
very good pixel density that allows for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.470 
very good pixel density that allows for
the<00:02:15.130> sharpness<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.820> text<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the sharpness of the text but on the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.210 
the sharpness of the text but on the
other<00:02:16.570> side<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.350> not<00:02:17.500> only<00:02:17.530> comparable

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
other side it is not only comparable

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.010 
other side it is not only comparable
it's<00:02:18.490> also<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.970> little<00:02:19.300> bit<00:02:19.420> more<00:02:19.630> far<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
it's also a little bit more far and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.200 
it's also a little bit more far and
beyond<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.740> be<00:02:20.830> able<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:22.000> give

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
beyond just to be able to really give

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.030 
beyond just to be able to really give
you<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.690> sharpness<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.290> clarity<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.800> you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
you that sharpness and clarity that you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.500 
you that sharpness and clarity that you
want<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.820> text<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.240> you're<00:02:25.360> going

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
want to see in the text if you're going

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
want to see in the text if you're going
to<00:02:25.600> be<00:02:25.780> reading<00:02:25.990> say<00:02:26.230> ebooks<00:02:26.680> or<00:02:26.830> just

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
to be reading say ebooks or just

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670 
to be reading say ebooks or just
browsing<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> web<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.760> general<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.680> finally

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
browsing the web in general and finally

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.780 
browsing the web in general and finally
at<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.830> end<00:02:29.950> we're<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.610> take<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
at the end we're just going to take a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.850 
at the end we're just going to take a
look<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.090> Epic<00:02:31.450> Citadel<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> benchmarking

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
look at Epic Citadel it's a benchmarking

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.200 
look at Epic Citadel it's a benchmarking
application<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.580> i<00:02:33.610> haven't<00:02:33.880> used<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
application that i haven't used in a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.250 
application that i haven't used in a
little<00:02:34.450> bit<00:02:34.570> but<00:02:34.690> i<00:02:34.750> thought<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.050> would<00:02:35.140> be<00:02:35.230> a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
little bit but i thought it would be a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
little bit but i thought it would be a
good<00:02:35.410> way<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.590> showing<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> 3d<00:02:36.400> capability

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
good way of showing the 3d capability

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.910 
good way of showing the 3d capability
not<00:02:37.390> only<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.960> processing<00:02:38.440> package<00:02:38.710> found

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
not only of the processing package found

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.280 
not only of the processing package found
within<00:02:39.130> but<00:02:39.430> also<00:02:39.550> in<00:02:40.300> terms<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.810> looking<00:02:41.140> at

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
within but also in terms of looking at

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.230 
within but also in terms of looking at
the<00:02:41.410> screen<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.950> how<00:02:42.100> well<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.670> able<00:02:43.030> to

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
the screen and how well it is able to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.320 
the screen and how well it is able to
produce<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:45.040> display<00:02:45.580> all<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.850> these

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
produce and to display all of these

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.290 
produce and to display all of these
great<00:02:46.410> graphical<00:02:47.410> elements<00:02:48.180> alright<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
great graphical elements alright and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.730 
great graphical elements alright and
let's<00:02:49.330> take<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> look<00:02:49.810> at<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.020> handling<00:02:50.590> what

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
let's take a look at the handling what

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.250 
let's take a look at the handling what
we<00:02:50.860> have<00:02:51.010> here<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.550> LG<00:02:51.910> g2<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.870> original

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
we have here in the LG g2 the original

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.470 
we have here in the LG g2 the original
from<00:02:53.410> last<00:02:53.620> year<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.610> small<00:02:54.970> bezel<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
from last year is the small bezel the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.270 
from last year is the small bezel the
thin<00:02:55.660> bezel<00:02:55.990> all<00:02:56.140> around<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.800> allowed<00:02:57.040> for

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
thin bezel all around that allowed for

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.400 
thin bezel all around that allowed for
very<00:02:57.550> easy<00:02:57.790> handling<00:02:58.210> despite<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.080> screen

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
very easy handling despite this screen

help because if you ever use other large

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.570 
help because if you ever use other large
devices<00:03:35.410> out<00:03:35.680> there<00:03:35.710> it<00:03:36.160> might<00:03:36.280> be<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> little

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
devices out there it might be a little

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.460 
devices out there it might be a little
bit<00:03:36.760> tough<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:36.970> use<00:03:37.270> in<00:03:37.420> one<00:03:37.570> hand<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.290> that's

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
bit tough to use in one hand but that's

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.320 
bit tough to use in one hand but that's
not<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.710> case<00:03:38.740> with<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.100> g3<00:03:39.520> especially<00:03:40.180> for

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
not the case with the g3 especially for

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.910 
not the case with the g3 especially for
particular<00:03:40.690> tasks<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.440> would<00:03:41.680> need<00:03:41.800> to

particular tasks that you would need to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.980 
particular tasks that you would need to
do<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.160> one<00:03:42.280> hand<00:03:42.490> like<00:03:42.670> say<00:03:42.880> typing<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.870> are

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
do in one hand like say typing you are

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.210 
do in one hand like say typing you are
able<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.350> reach<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.680> other<00:03:44.800> side<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:45.160> the

this screen in this bezel this is also
one<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> more<00:03:53.710> attractive<00:03:53.920> ones<00:03:54.310> because

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
one of the more attractive ones because

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.160 
one of the more attractive ones because
you<00:03:54.730> have<00:03:54.850> so<00:03:55.090> much<00:03:55.240> screen<00:03:55.600> real<00:03:55.630> estate<00:03:55.870> to

on device as well maybe you just haven't
tried<00:04:04.180> one<00:04:04.360> because<00:04:04.600> there<00:04:04.720> are<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> lot<00:04:05.140> of

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
tried one because there are a lot of

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.990 
tried one because there are a lot of
benefits<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.830> them<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.130> already<00:04:06.460> showed<00:04:06.940> you

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
benefits to them I already showed you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.270 
benefits to them I already showed you
the<00:04:07.300> resolution<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.380> find<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:08.980> LG

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
the resolution that you find on the LG

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.090 
the resolution that you find on the LG
g3<00:04:09.460> because<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.120> has<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:10.450> quad<00:04:10.660> HD<00:04:11.020> display

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
g3 because it has that quad HD display

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.610 
g3 because it has that quad HD display
but<00:04:12.100> by<00:04:12.310> having<00:04:12.490> a<00:04:12.730> larger<00:04:13.270> surface<00:04:14.110> area<00:04:14.260> for

but by having a larger surface area for

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.050 
but by having a larger surface area for
you<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:14.890> work<00:04:15.070> with<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.430> could<00:04:15.580> do<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> lot<00:04:16.030> of

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
you to work with you could do a lot of

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.760 
you to work with you could do a lot of
different<00:04:16.450> things<00:04:16.600> with<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.020> screen<00:04:17.320> like

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
different things with the screen like

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.650 
different things with the screen like
read<00:04:18.160> even<00:04:18.460> more<00:04:18.730> because<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.150> can<00:04:19.270> fit<00:04:19.480> more

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
read even more because it can fit more

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.930 
read even more because it can fit more
you<00:04:19.840> can<00:04:19.960> watch<00:04:20.170> videos<00:04:20.680> even<00:04:21.010> easier<00:04:21.310> but

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
you can watch videos even easier but

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.430 
you can watch videos even easier but
also<00:04:22.090> there's<00:04:22.390> gaming<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.050> already<00:04:23.169> showed

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
also there's gaming and I already showed

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.290 
also there's gaming and I already showed
you<00:04:23.500> Epic<00:04:23.890> Citadel<00:04:24.070> earlier<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:24.880> let<00:04:25.060> me<00:04:25.090> just

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
you Epic Citadel earlier but let me just

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.740

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.970 
show you
now<00:04:25.960> what<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.470> looks<00:04:26.620> like<00:04:26.710> when<00:04:26.830> you're

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
now what it looks like when you're

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.260 
now what it looks like when you're
gaming<00:04:27.160> on<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.520> screen<00:04:27.730> because<00:04:27.850> there's<00:04:28.180> a

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
gaming on the screen because there's a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.330 
gaming on the screen because there's a
lot<00:04:28.480> of<00:04:28.510> room<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:28.840> be<00:04:29.110> able<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.530> maybe<00:04:29.890> use<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
lot of room to be able to maybe use the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.430 
lot of room to be able to maybe use the
touch<00:04:30.580> controls<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.210> still<00:04:31.690> not<00:04:31.810> obstruct

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
touch controls and still not obstruct

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.350 
touch controls and still not obstruct
any<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.190> action<00:04:33.670> that<00:04:33.700> is<00:04:33.910> happening<00:04:34.090> on

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
any of the action that is happening on

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.480 
any of the action that is happening on
the<00:04:34.510> screen<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.290> an<00:04:35.500> example<00:04:35.800> with<00:04:36.070> combo

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the screen this is an example with combo

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.300 
the screen this is an example with combo
crew<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.150> is<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.480> breeze<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:38.470> display

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
crew and it is a breeze on this display

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.670 
crew and it is a breeze on this display
not<00:04:39.670> only<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.180> sharper<00:04:40.600> here<00:04:40.870> because<00:04:41.350> of

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
not only is it sharper here because of

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.860 
not only is it sharper here because of
the<00:04:41.710> higher<00:04:42.040> resolution<00:04:42.670> but<00:04:42.820> it's<00:04:43.000> easier<00:04:43.390> to

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
the higher resolution but it's easier to

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.690 
the higher resolution but it's easier to
actually<00:04:44.080> play<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.740> because<00:04:44.890> I'll<00:04:45.340> be<00:04:45.370> able<00:04:45.580> to

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
actually play it because I'll be able to

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.070 
actually play it because I'll be able to
use<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.030> thumb<00:04:46.180> controls<00:04:46.630> on<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.870> sides

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
use the thumb controls on the sides

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.450 
use the thumb controls on the sides
without<00:04:47.230> obstructing<00:04:47.740> anything<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.370> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
without obstructing anything in the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.180 
without obstructing anything in the
middle<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.320> so<00:04:50.320> there<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.680> have<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:51.040> this

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
middle and so there you have it for this

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.820 
middle and so there you have it for this
look<00:04:51.340> at<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.520> screen<00:04:51.760> of<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:51.940> LG<00:04:52.360> g3<00:04:52.740> well<00:04:53.740> now

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
look at the screen of the LG g3 well now

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.960 
look at the screen of the LG g3 well now
one<00:04:54.100> thing<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.400> great<00:04:54.640> about<00:04:54.730> this

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
one thing that is great about this

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.580 
one thing that is great about this
screen<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.810> fact<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.290> get<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.560> best

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
screen is the fact that you get the best

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.200 
screen is the fact that you get the best
of<00:04:56.830> both<00:04:56.890> worlds<00:04:57.460> if<00:04:57.730> you<00:04:57.850> had<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.000> high

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
of both worlds if you had a high

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.030 
of both worlds if you had a high
resolution<00:04:58.480> but<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.200> have<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.350> smaller<00:04:59.770> size

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
resolution but you have a smaller size

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.010 
resolution but you have a smaller size
display<00:05:00.580> you<00:05:00.730> might<00:05:00.880> not<00:05:01.000> be<00:05:01.150> able<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.480> really

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
display you might not be able to really

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.110 
display you might not be able to really
enjoy<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.860> high<00:05:03.190> resolution<00:05:03.700> quite<00:05:03.850> as<00:05:03.970> much

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
enjoy that high resolution quite as much

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.790 
enjoy that high resolution quite as much
if<00:05:04.390> you<00:05:04.600> had<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> larger<00:05:05.169> screen<00:05:05.320> but<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.590> lower

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
if you had a larger screen but a lower

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.350 
if you had a larger screen but a lower
resolution<00:05:06.040> well<00:05:06.640> we've<00:05:06.850> all<00:05:07.000> had<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.240> deal

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
resolution well we've all had to deal

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.670 
resolution well we've all had to deal
with<00:05:07.480> that<00:05:07.600> before<00:05:07.930> it's<00:05:08.169> all<00:05:08.350> it's<00:05:08.560> not

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
with that before it's all it's not

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.580 
with that before it's all it's not
really<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.100> best<00:05:09.310> case<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.750> this<00:05:11.050> phone<00:05:11.350> you

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
really the best case in this phone you

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.920 
really the best case in this phone you
get<00:05:11.770> not<00:05:12.010> only<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.340> larger<00:05:13.090> screen<00:05:13.300> at<00:05:13.419> 5.5

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
get not only the larger screen at 5.5

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.450 
get not only the larger screen at 5.5
inches<00:05:14.230> but<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.560> get<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.740> quad<00:05:15.070> HD

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
inches but you get the quad HD

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.280 
inches but you get the quad HD
resolution<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.540> allows<00:05:16.780> for<00:05:16.990> not<00:05:17.110> only

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
resolution and that allows for not only

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.380 
resolution and that allows for not only
the<00:05:17.500> great<00:05:17.680> pixel<00:05:18.100> density<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.669> clarity<00:05:19.210> for

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
the great pixel density and clarity for

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.580 
the great pixel density and clarity for
all<00:05:19.540> of<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.780> things<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.169> want<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.470> do
