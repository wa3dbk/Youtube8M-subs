dollars 2499 think it was like 2014 it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
dollars 2499 think it was like 2014 it
wasn't<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.770> than<00:01:10.799> twenty<00:01:11.869> twenty<00:01:12.869> four

dollars or 26 whatever shovel but yeah

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
dollars or 26 whatever shovel but yeah
so<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> decided<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> get<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> normally<00:01:18.689> i

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
would get it take one be from my way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740

like<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> solid<00:01:23.159> color<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:24.180> i<00:01:24.390> tried<00:01:24.630> to
