and on my left side you have a level arm

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
and on my left side you have a level arm
here<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.340> lift<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.680> this

here you lift it up and down and this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.090 
here you lift it up and down and this
device<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.299> precise<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.259> within<00:01:43.530> ten

thousand of an inch from end to end

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.780 
thousand of an inch from end to end

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
level stop on top and you put the inside

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.139 
level stop on top and you put the inside
of<00:02:03.240> your<00:02:03.360> palm<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> he<00:02:05.280> send<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> guide

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
of your palm and he send on this guide

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
of your palm and he send on this guide
and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.140> finger<00:02:07.350> onto<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and then you put your finger onto this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.120 
and then you put your finger onto this
red<00:02:08.220> leveler<00:02:08.729> here

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
red leveler here

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.730 
red leveler here
and<00:02:09.250> lifted<00:02:09.670> upwards<00:02:09.790> at<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.900> same<00:02:11.140> time<00:02:11.440> as

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
and lifted upwards at the same time as

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.090 
and lifted upwards at the same time as
you<00:02:11.890> open<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:12.640> close<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.780> handle<00:02:14.680> here

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
you open and close this handle here

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.210 
you open and close this handle here
now<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.760> rubber<00:02:16.060> jumps<00:02:16.600> up<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.560> actually

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
now the rubber jumps up and actually

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.830 
now the rubber jumps up and actually
what<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.610> does<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.910> hits<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.270> ceiling<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.810> here

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
what it does it hits the ceiling in here

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.450 
what it does it hits the ceiling in here
and<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> keeps<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.590> totally<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.250> totally

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
and it keeps it totally and totally

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.910 
and it keeps it totally and totally
straight<00:02:23.310> no<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.910> think<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> tremor<00:02:25.740> which<00:02:26.740> I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
straight no you think the tremor which I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.740 
straight no you think the tremor which I
already<00:02:27.310> used<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.730> couple<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.120> times<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.600> can

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
already used a couple of times you can

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.740 
already used a couple of times you can
see<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.350> five<00:02:29.680> trimmings<00:02:30.280> already<00:02:30.750> I'll

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750

actually<00:03:52.270> end<00:03:52.450> up<00:03:52.600> like<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> ski<00:03:53.680> slope<00:03:53.710> when

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
actually end up like a ski slope when

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.610 
actually end up like a ski slope when
you're<00:03:54.340> done<00:03:54.490> sharpening<00:03:55.210> so<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> prevent

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
you're done sharpening so to prevent

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.600 
you're done sharpening so to prevent
that<00:03:56.770> from<00:03:56.830> happening<00:03:58.170> always<00:03:59.170> be<00:03:59.350> sure<00:03:59.620> that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
that from happening always be sure that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.090 
that from happening always be sure that
the<00:04:00.820> top<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.450> speeder<00:04:01.750> over<00:04:02.170> here<00:04:02.440> is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
the top of the speeder over here is

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.900 
the top of the speeder over here is
against<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.760> stop<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.280> slide<00:04:06.550> a<00:04:06.580> topping

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
against the stop so the slide a topping

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.710 
against the stop so the slide a topping
as<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.150> stopped

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
as you stopped

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.190 
as you stopped
now<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:08.920> media<00:04:09.310> rubber<00:04:09.580> here<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:09.880> lower<00:04:10.510> than

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
now this media rubber here is lower than

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.350 
now this media rubber here is lower than
this<00:04:11.380> one<00:04:11.650> here<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:12.490> only<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.210> the

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
this one here you only have to have the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.570 
this one here you only have to have the
higher<00:04:13.600> one<00:04:13.930> now<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.830> this<00:04:14.980> side<00:04:15.220> we're<00:04:15.430> gonna

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
higher one now on this side we're gonna

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.699 
higher one now on this side we're gonna
sharpen

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
sharpen

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.240 
sharpen
so<00:04:17.280> now<00:04:17.430> what<00:04:17.579> we<00:04:17.699> do<00:04:18.259> put<00:04:19.259> it<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.500> there<00:04:19.739> get

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
so now what we do put it in there get

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.180 
so now what we do put it in there get
rid<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.609> show<00:04:20.850> up<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:22.039> we<00:04:23.039> do<00:04:23.160> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
rid of that show up in there we do the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.790 
rid of that show up in there we do the
same<00:04:23.460> thing<00:04:23.699> again<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.030> lift<00:04:24.389> this<00:04:24.570> out<00:04:24.800> at

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
same thing again you lift this out at

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.409 
same thing again you lift this out at
the<00:04:25.860> same<00:04:26.130> time<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.520> open<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.000> close<00:04:27.030> this

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
the same time you open and close this

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.469 
the same time you open and close this
and<00:04:27.720> then<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:27.990> let<00:04:28.169> go<00:04:28.199> with<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.620> thing<00:04:28.979> here

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
and then you let go with this thing here

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.230 
and then you let go with this thing here
and<00:04:30.500> now<00:04:31.500> they<00:04:32.039> have<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.340> totally<00:04:32.850> straight

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
and now they have it totally straight

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240 
and now they have it totally straight
here

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
here

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.710 
here
replace<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.430> sharpener<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.030> slide<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:36.600> over

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
replace the sharpener you slide it over

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.719 
replace the sharpener you slide it over
to<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.990> new<00:04:37.020> portion<00:04:37.680> on<00:04:37.800> your<00:04:37.919> razor<00:04:38.100> blade<00:04:38.460> and

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
to a new portion on your razor blade and

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.080 
to a new portion on your razor blade and
then<00:04:39.690> again<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.770> this<00:04:41.009> a<00:04:41.039> natural<00:04:41.340> rocker<00:04:41.759> so

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
then again is this a natural rocker so

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.790 
then again is this a natural rocker so
it's<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> little<00:04:42.360> bit<00:04:42.509> harder<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.110> little<00:04:43.710> bit

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
it's a little bit harder a little bit

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.230 
it's a little bit harder a little bit
more<00:04:43.979> friction<00:04:44.220> but<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.699> still<00:04:44.910> works

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
more friction but it still works

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.159 
more friction but it still works
really<00:04:45.780> really<00:04:45.930> good<00:04:49.669> now<00:04:50.669> get<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.780> end

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
really really good now get on this end

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.409 
really really good now get on this end
here<00:04:52.229> now<00:04:53.099> of<00:04:53.220> course<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.610> rubber<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.120> lower

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
here now of course this rubber is lower

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.560 
here now of course this rubber is lower
than<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.110> one<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:56.340> do<00:04:56.460> not<00:04:56.699> we<00:04:57.120> are<00:04:57.150> slide

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
than this one so we do not we are slide

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.730 
than this one so we do not we are slide
it<00:04:57.720> over<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:59.310> we<00:04:59.400> always<00:04:59.550> do<00:04:59.849> the<00:05:00.000> higher

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
it over and we always do the higher

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.219 
it over and we always do the higher
portion<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:05.490> now<00:05:05.699> what<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:06.000> do<00:05:06.210> lower<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.199> down

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
portion so now what we do lower it down

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.450 
portion so now what we do lower it down
in<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.770> dark<00:05:07.979> it's<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.340> crystal<00:05:08.759> level<00:05:09.120> stopper

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
in the dark it's a crystal level stopper

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.680 
in the dark it's a crystal level stopper
and<00:05:11.460> lift<00:05:11.820> it<00:05:12.030> up<00:05:12.120> again<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.750> lock<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.199> up<00:05:13.320> and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
and lift it up again and lock it up and

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:25.410 
and lift it up again and lock it up and
that<00:05:15.690> is<00:05:15.870> much<00:05:16.050> rarity<00:05:16.530> shop

what<00:05:45.880> a<00:05:45.910> circle<00:05:46.420> speed<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.840> all<00:05:47.020> about<00:05:47.640> this<00:05:48.640> is

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
what a circle speed is all about this is

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.930 
what a circle speed is all about this is
the<00:05:49.000> channel<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.920> it's<00:05:50.920> an<00:05:51.040> adjustable<00:05:51.700> speed

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
the channel and it's an adjustable speed

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.300 
the channel and it's an adjustable speed
you've<00:05:52.240> got<00:05:52.390> one<00:05:52.600> two<00:05:53.080> three<00:05:53.410> four<00:05:54.040> different

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
you've got one two three four different

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.690 
you've got one two three four different
settings<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.960> speed<00:05:56.260> is<00:05:56.410> 40<00:05:56.830> times<00:05:57.040> four

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
settings the speed is 40 times four

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.430 
settings the speed is 40 times four
this<00:05:57.850> is<00:05:58.090> four<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:58.660> you<00:05:58.750> can<00:05:58.780> sharpen<00:05:59.140> the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
this is four and you can sharpen the

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.070 
this is four and you can sharpen the
rubber<00:05:59.620> three<00:05:59.950> times<00:06:00.510> in<00:06:01.510> each<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.900> those<00:06:02.020> four

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
rubber three times in each of those four

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.390 
rubber three times in each of those four
settings<00:06:02.740> which<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.550> twelve<00:06:03.910> sharpening<00:06:04.540> and

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
settings which is twelve sharpening and

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.890 
settings which is twelve sharpening and
that<00:06:06.400> will<00:06:06.580> save<00:06:06.850> you<00:06:07.060> more<00:06:07.270> money<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.020> also<00:06:08.740> a
