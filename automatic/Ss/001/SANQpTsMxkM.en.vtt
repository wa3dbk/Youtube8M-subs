I'm waiting that might have been a

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.949 
I'm waiting that might have been a
little<00:02:57.670> bit<00:02:57.820> big<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.060> no<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.510> seems<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.870> be

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
little bit big but no it seems to be

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.460 
little bit big but no it seems to be
uploading<00:02:59.440> pretty<00:02:59.680> fast<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.630> says<00:03:01.870> okay
