cars that are actually worth the most I
know<00:02:58.460> it's<00:02:58.700> crazy<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.860> when<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.130> saw<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.400> this

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
know it's crazy and when I saw that this

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.160 
know it's crazy and when I saw that this
week<00:03:01.880> was<00:03:02.000> pass<00:03:02.180> blocking<00:03:02.480> online<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.050> knew

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
week was pass blocking online so I knew

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.470 
week was pass blocking online so I knew
they<00:03:03.290> had<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.560> include<00:03:03.830> Johnny<00:03:04.190> Evans<00:03:04.460> and<00:03:05.210> I

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
they had to include Johnny Evans and I

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.910 
they had to include Johnny Evans and I
actually<00:03:05.630> think<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.020> Jahri<00:03:06.230> Evans<00:03:06.380> card<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:06.890> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
actually think the Jahri Evans card is a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.740 
actually think the Jahri Evans card is a
duplicate<00:03:07.340> last<00:03:07.940> time<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.210> checked<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.690> was

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
pretty much a duplicate and it was

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.020
