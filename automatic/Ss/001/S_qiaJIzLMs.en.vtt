00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.180
Own geocache, part 1 of 3

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.180
Materials...

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.600
LED

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.580
resistor

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.460
solar panel

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.380
box

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.100
cables

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.380
zipper bags

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.000
Big box and padlock

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.720
Tools

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.180
soldering

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.700
and all types of adhesive tape

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.620
Let's go

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:14.300
First I have connected solar panel 5,5V with resistor ~80om and LED 3,6V ~20-25mA

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:26.260
Resistor is used, because without it LED could take too much energy and could burn(spoil)

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.640
I drilled holes in the box

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.860
and I linked "my small electrical system" with it using adhesive tape and "hot plastic?"

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:53.380
next stages concern improve the appearance of geocache

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:20.080
question part of geocache is almost ready. We need only add instructions and check if it works

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.760
Every good geocache should have 3 certificates for first, second and third finder and nice loogbook

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.460
How I have written on my fanpage (look description), I created my own "Geokret" (en. TravelBug(TM) or GeoLutins)

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.140
To geocache I have added geocoin

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140
zodiac sign

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.140
old adapter

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.140
leash

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.720
and of course pencil

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:19.840
Now we need to do better camouflage and add information about geocache

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:37.640
And here bonus for you, my desk after work =) wait for the next part of the film!
