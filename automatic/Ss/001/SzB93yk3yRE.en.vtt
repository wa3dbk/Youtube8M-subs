00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
this is live until that connection takes

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.850 
this is live until that connection takes
place<00:02:12.250> so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
place so

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.559 
place so
this<00:02:14.860> right<00:02:15.069> here<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.030> high-powered

do is plug twist push the button there

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.559 
do is plug twist push the button there
it<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.640> pulsating<00:02:31.150> yellow

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
it is and now that pulsating yellow

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.479 
it is and now that pulsating yellow
means<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.140> vehicle<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.590> charging<00:02:33.010> when<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
means the vehicle is charging when the

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.309 
means the vehicle is charging when the
car<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.519> fully<00:02:36.879> charged<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.810> light<00:02:38.049> turns

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
car is fully charged that light turns

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.680 
car is fully charged that light turns
green<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.459> charging<00:02:39.849> stops<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.360> its<00:02:40.390> own

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
green and the charging stops on its own

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.780 
green and the charging stops on its own
so<00:02:41.049> this<00:02:41.230> houses<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.950> six<00:02:42.310> thousand<00:02:42.700> eight

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so this houses the six thousand eight

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.500 
so this houses the six thousand eight
hundred<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.150> thirty-one<00:02:43.920> lithium-ion<00:02:44.920> cells

is here is your radiator which which is
a<00:03:45.160> heat<00:03:45.940> exchanger<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:47.019> pulls<00:03:47.260> double

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
a heat exchanger so this pulls double

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.699 
a heat exchanger so this pulls double
duty<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:48.639> boat<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.810> air<00:03:49.959> conditioner<00:03:50.530> it

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
duty this boat is the air conditioner it

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.610 
duty this boat is the air conditioner it
cools<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.430> cabin<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.810> also<00:03:52.989> cools<00:03:53.440> the
