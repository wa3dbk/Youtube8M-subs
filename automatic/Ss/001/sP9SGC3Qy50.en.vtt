00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
people out there so nice good fit for

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.359 
people out there so nice good fit for
your<00:01:02.820> average<00:01:03.120> foot<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:04.769> does<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.189> little

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
your average foot it does have a little

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.010 
your average foot it does have a little
bit<00:01:05.489> higher<00:01:05.640> instep<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> give

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
bit higher instep so it's going to give

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
bit higher instep so it's going to give
a<00:01:07.049> little<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.290> comfort<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.950> relaxed<00:01:08.580> fit

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
going to get that pressure pushing down

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.070 
going to get that pressure pushing down
on<00:01:12.030> top<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.960> foot<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.960> technica<00:01:15.960> is

on top of your foot the technica is
using<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.560> carbon<00:01:17.100> steel<00:01:17.340> buckles<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
using now carbon steel buckles a lot of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850 
using now carbon steel buckles a lot of
companies<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:19.020> still<00:01:19.170> using<00:01:19.380> aluminum

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
buckles carbon steel is lighter weight

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
buckles carbon steel is lighter weight
and<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.950> also<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.850> eat<00:01:23.939> its<00:01:24.150> higher

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and it's also so they can eat its higher

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.490 
and it's also so they can eat its higher
strength<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.229> thinner

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
