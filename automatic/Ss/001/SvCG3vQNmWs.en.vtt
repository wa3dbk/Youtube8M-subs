 wing removed to remove the pen 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.370

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.980
 business 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.450
 tours 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060
 as 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 luchenok to unscrew the top 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.420
 we pass 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 drag out 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.060
 but 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.010
 but 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.480
 be ready 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.480
 where to hide 22 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.069
 in short 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.910
 but 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.560
 here 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.560
 you silent will go 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.170
 so unscrew 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860
 neatly 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.959
 willingly 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.489
 all poured into a container here we have 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.489
 it turns out there's some oil became 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 dirty 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:59.260
 pour out all the capacity will still need 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:03.860
 hexagon to unscrew the plug 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.010
 pull the spring from the bottom of the fork 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.010
 by flocks so 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.890
 here 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.920
 at all 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.800
 working 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.370
 So 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.370
 start off 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.320
 but 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.610
 such here 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.870
 bill Now 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.870
 everything is completely sorted out 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:58.159
 poklon to lend not fell here 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.110
 how to get it yourself 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:16.400
 open great is selected 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.840
 so here the retaining ring goes we remove 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.169
 retaining ring 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.169
 here 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.510
 so now you need a flat chain 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.020
 we insert because 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.210
 so that 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.840
 we begin to press preferably in a circle 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.200
 so here 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.980
 for pulling harder is 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.980
 already changed 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.820
 size in this fork alpha racer 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:58.350
 2535 ks 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.350
 we select in size themselves to the head 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:11.980
 so as not to spoil it 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.980
 slowly begin to hammer around 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.530
 well we have problems with the sky 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.250
 what 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.740
 from 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.740
 so it should turn out 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:54.280
 now we put the retaining ring 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.280
 we wipe everything into place 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.280
 then i was 1
