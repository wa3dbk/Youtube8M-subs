00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.770
 my impressions on this little stick of mine 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 what combined the first color that 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.210
 use is a light green lightly 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.210

 on the mobile eyelid I extend the red is 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:28.070
 a perry with a very warm shade from 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:36.470
 to take back the first eye shadow and it 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.420
 spread over the barry on the corner sr 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.990
 in the fold of the eye stand or the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 aubergine 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 I apply pearly white on the arch 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.590
 eyebrow 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.380
 on the lower rim I first extend the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.380
 light pink then eggplant 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.210
 to outline the eye I use eyeliner 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.210
 the new york of benefits 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.239
 review over the liner with some of the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.239
 eggplant color 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:26.170
 just feed it I apply the kajal pencil 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:36.010
 number 127 of deborah milano the mascara 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:40.890
 is the brand new lancom clanius these 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.890
 they are the ironic eyelashes of house of lies 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.470
 for the eyebrows I used the depor 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.099
 audi anastase to get color together is the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.099
 chunk bed 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:08.880
 the blush is my beloved lime trees and mike 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.680
 finally on the lips or applied the no 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:17.400
 lipstick lipstick of Dr. Perricone e 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.510
 this is the end result then what 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.560
 I think 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:27.870
 as usual and therefore at a price 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:31.650
 dior not a low price is that anyway 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.990
 it is typical of high perfumery products 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.320
 as dior as chanel 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.960
 having said that we talk specifically about 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.450
 this small spoon repeats with the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.780
 I really like the color combination 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:51.030
 especially that central red I think 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.800
 that is really beautiful not 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:59.100
 easy to find and it is definitely 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.080
 among the five colors my favorite 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.970
 and I must say probably what I did 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.330
 he made this pick choose 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.919
 this combination compared to the others 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.160
 and also my favorite as like 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:18.600
 consistency as an application 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.200
 the others I find I had big 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.860
 expectations for this which is color 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.120
 darker 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:30.020
 but I found it really dusty like 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.790
 a little all the others except for the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.780
 color the central eyeshadow I find that 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.410
 all the others are rather 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.840
 dusty and it's something I don't 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.180
 especially thrills with more colors 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.840
 dark because they tend to stain 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.730
 therefore they require attention 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.640
 they require more attention so I don't 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.160
 I know if they sell this color alone 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.740
 because it would be really ideal because 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.390
 really really very nice of course 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.700
 the palette a small wall dior yes 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.770
 very well presents very nice yes 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.280
 closes well and easy to put on 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.320
 handbag even the applicators are 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.570
 surely above average at 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.840
 mirrors freight mirrors know it 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:19.080
 mirror and always very comfortable comfortable 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.080
 so my judgment in general is 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:30.220
 average in the sense that I have to find a 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.810
 balance between the color I laid out 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.040
 on the eyelid that I like very much 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.530
 what I like is the yield as it lies 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.480
 absolutely the others a little less ne 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.400
 I find a bit like colors like 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.400
 pigmentation like 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.560
 for the fact that they are dusty then 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.010
 nothing special 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.170
 so definitely average excellent 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.950
 I have to say I can't complain about 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:03.510
 kept because it resists all day i 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:05.300
 colors remain fixed on the eyelid 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.830
 the eye shadow is fixed on the eyelid 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.360
 absolutely 28 of the day 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.120
 as usual hopes this network that 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:17.190
 it was especially useful with a 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:21.360
 so expensive product always better and 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.370
 I always like to have personally 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.760
 an idea before arriving in perfumery 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.820
 have an idea and more confirm it or 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.790
 say no but I like it is great 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.770
 I absolutely take it so for it is 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:38.520
 always better to have it in my opinion is more 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:42.200
 opinion so I hope it was helpful 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.200
 living a big hello kiss
