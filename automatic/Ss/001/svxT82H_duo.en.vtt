00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.290
 hello i heartily in my love 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.450
 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.429
 Today I'm packing again today 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 I want cake baked apples make the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.970
 They want to do it forever and today 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.080
 i thought so now is the best 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 opportunity just start and make 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.170
 right first we have to get one 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.539
 make shortcrust pastry 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 and I've got 100 for that 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.530
 moment 150 grams of butter weighed here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.559
 cut exactly pieces 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.559
 now 125 grams of sugar are added 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.860
 and 300 grams of flour 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.400
 that were already all ingredients companies 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 but only supervised 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 Now we just leave the whole thing 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.930
 minute knead on stage four 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.870
 that's it here now and distribute it 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.600
 he looks like we can go right away 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.150
 you have to process it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.650
 only in a greased springform 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.250
 roll out or just press we want 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.970
 then we need apples with me are 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.970
 seven apples have to be peeled 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 and to be gutted but so removed 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.560
 that you are practically just like that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.720
 a cookie cutter the core housing 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 bad so you have a hole because in 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.700
 then we will be that hole 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.340
 fill marzipan raw meal rows 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.410
 That's what I'm doing now and first 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.970
 then we get behind in the we 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.290
 have done everything with the apples still 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.110
 in delicious homemade 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 custard love 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.940
 Here I have the dough in the form 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.640
 done and peeled my apples 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.620
 gutted and with marzipan crude 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.660
 felt it looks like it can now 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.570
 I have about 100 grams 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.060
 used marzipan raw mass he hangs but 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.550
 whatever the parents would have then 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.910
 Let's see how it goes with you 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.180
 exactly and now we may do 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.350
 as bus a delicious manikutty like that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.150
 Now we do with ours 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.600
 Custard continues and indeed need 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.590
 We have 500 grams of milk I have myself 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.590
 ever measured 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.910
 that's a stupid thing that always drips 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.400
 she is not only new buy 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.960
 then I have two yolks here 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.460
 I've got the Egyptians that 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.260
 do you look similar I have the eggs 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.230
 separated and the yolk was now only 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.440
 still here in the cup in it then 50 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.440
 gram 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:34.560
 a pinch of salt 30 grams of starch 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.450
 then also my half vanilla bean and 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.400
 We should freak it out 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.800
 I've done that before 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.660
 comes smoking and also half 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.890
 vanilleschote first to give the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.120
 we have to go back afterwards 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:20.670
 we have all the ingredients and fish out 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:30.840
 that should now be seven minutes at 90 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:33.450
 degree left running level three weeks 85 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.520
 grad upper lower heat behave higher 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:41.490
 then here we have the finished now 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 custard in we just pour her 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.730
 between rhine and soloist above 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.730
 about it 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.890
 I ask it it is one 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.850
 dishwasher I hope so 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.850
 do not bother 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.510
 scrape out 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.750
 somehow that's a little bit more 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.640
 try too little 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.410
 So I will cook one again and 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.210
 then redistribute it again and then 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.850
 Let's see if I am satisfied then 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.460
 is the same so I still have now 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.650
 I cooked in the second custard 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.470
 which is now spread over it and still 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.800
 made of almonds on it so dear 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.950

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.710

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.150
 low heat for one hour 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.870
