that<00:02:37.800> they<00:02:37.950> operate<00:02:38.130> they<00:02:38.880> tried<00:02:39.150> those<00:02:39.450> silly

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that they operate they tried those silly

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.320 
that they operate they tried those silly
shoes<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:41.400> compared<00:02:41.880> them<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
shoes and I compared them with the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.090 
shoes and I compared them with the
odorous<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.200> they<00:02:43.320> gave<00:02:43.530> me<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.830> good

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
odorous and they gave me a very good

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.520 
odorous and they gave me a very good
indication<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.670> fit<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:46.050> shoe<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.470> I

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
indication on the fit of the shoe so I

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.380 
indication on the fit of the shoe so I
was<00:02:46.709> fairly<00:02:46.950> confident<00:02:47.520> which<00:02:48.060> was<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.450> buy

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
was fairly confident which was to buy

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.160 
was fairly confident which was to buy
well<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.230> CDs<00:02:52.880> forty-fourth<00:02:53.880> are<00:02:54.660> slightly

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
well the CDs forty-fourth are slightly

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.470 
well the CDs forty-fourth are slightly
snug<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.650> my<00:02:55.830> feet<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> mean<00:02:56.820> they're<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> little

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
snug on my feet I mean they're a little

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.030 
snug on my feet I mean they're a little
bit<00:02:57.660> tight<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.080> toe<00:02:58.230> area<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
bit tight in the toe area the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.410 
bit tight in the toe area the
forty-fourth<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> half<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.600> little<00:03:01.410> bit<00:03:01.830> too

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
forty-fourth and a half a little bit too

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.910 
forty-fourth and a half a little bit too
loose<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:05.010> actually<00:03:06.380> struck<00:03:07.380> gold<00:03:07.650> with

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
loose and I actually struck gold with

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.690 
loose and I actually struck gold with
these<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> 44<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:11.040> theodora's

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
these because this is a 44 in theodora's

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.230 
these because this is a 44 in theodora's
and<00:03:12.060> they<00:03:12.720> fit<00:03:13.050> me<00:03:13.230> pretty<00:03:14.190> much<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.790> between

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
and they fit me pretty much in between

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.090 
and they fit me pretty much in between
the<00:03:15.709> blue<00:03:16.709> CDs<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.400> other<00:03:18.300> one<00:03:18.950> forty<00:03:19.950> four

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the blue CDs and other one forty four

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.479 
the blue CDs and other one forty four
and<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.280> half<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:22.310> indication<00:03:23.310> for

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and a half so this is a indication for

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.040 
and a half so this is a indication for
you<00:03:23.550> guys<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:23.970> were<00:03:24.269> trying<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.690> buy<00:03:24.900> those

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
that are definitely wider in the front

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.670 
that are definitely wider in the front
which<00:04:33.160> is<00:04:33.630> more<00:04:34.630> comfortable<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:37.419> other

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
which is more comfortable and the other

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.340 
which is more comfortable and the other
impression<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:39.009> so<00:04:39.250> far<00:04:39.430> as<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:40.300> CDs<00:04:41.139> when

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
impression I have so far as the CDs when

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.029 
impression I have so far as the CDs when
I<00:04:41.380> put<00:04:41.620> them<00:04:41.740> on<00:04:41.889> they<00:04:42.430> really<00:04:42.820> tight<00:04:43.120> and

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
I put them on they really tight and

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.279 
I put them on they really tight and
cardboard<00:04:45.039> like<00:04:45.479> around<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.810> top<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.199> the

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
cardboard like around the top of the

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.529 
cardboard like around the top of the
foot<00:04:48.060> compared<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.150> that

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
foot compared to that

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.930 
foot compared to that
the<00:04:49.750> DIA<00:04:49.930> Dora's<00:04:50.380> are<00:04:50.530> not<00:04:50.710> softer<00:04:51.250> they

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
the DIA Dora's are not softer they

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.040 
the DIA Dora's are not softer they
actually<00:04:52.919> feel<00:04:53.919> much<00:04:54.669> like<00:04:54.970> tennis<00:04:55.810> shoe

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
actually feel much like tennis shoe

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.580 
actually feel much like tennis shoe
would<00:04:56.289> feel<00:04:56.530> on<00:04:56.740> top<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:56.979> the<00:04:57.160> foot<00:04:58.120> so<00:04:58.590> they

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
would feel on top of the foot so they

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.590 
would feel on top of the foot so they
are<00:04:59.740> much<00:05:00.010> more<00:05:00.310> comfortable<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.910> my<00:05:01.150> opinion

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
are much more comfortable in my opinion

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.570 
are much more comfortable in my opinion
however<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.139> do<00:05:02.289> realize<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.039> some<00:05:03.250> people

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
however I do realize that some people

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.310 
however I do realize that some people
may<00:05:04.419> enjoy<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.470> stiffness<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:07.690> feel<00:05:08.289> of

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
may enjoy the stiffness and the feel of

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.960 
may enjoy the stiffness and the feel of
the<00:05:08.590> CDs<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:10.210> anyway<00:05:10.570> this<00:05:11.260> is<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.970> comparison

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
the CDs so anyway this is the comparison

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.610 
the CDs so anyway this is the comparison
between<00:05:13.360> those<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.330> CDs<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.900> do<00:05:17.139> believe

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
between those and the CDs I do believe

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.710 
between those and the CDs I do believe
that<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.949> Edoras<00:05:18.280> are<00:05:18.490> looking<00:05:19.210> very<00:05:19.240> cool

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
that the Edoras are looking very cool

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.040 
that the Edoras are looking very cool
and<00:05:20.190> see<00:05:21.190> how<00:05:21.400> they<00:05:22.060> feel<00:05:22.270> when<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.509> actually<00:05:22.780> go
