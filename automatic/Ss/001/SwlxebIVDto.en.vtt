00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.379
 hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.480
 Welcome once again to channel the 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.310
 video that I bring you today is about how 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.349
 remove the gel enamel on 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.940
 semi-permanent enameling that I teach you 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.269
 in the video that I'm going to leave here 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.320
 If you have not seen it, it's very, very 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.150
 simple is not fast but it is very easy 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.530
 and you can do it from home just 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.240
 I could be talking to a partner 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.770
 of class and he told me that she had 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.690
 done in an aesthetic center and that 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.000
 to take it off they told him he had to 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.620
 go there and well of course pay five 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.180
 euros more than what I had paid 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.710
 she got the manicure to take it off 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.320
 I know if they did some treatment 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.110
 special or some miraculous thing but 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.350
 as far as I know is as simple as 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.480
 let the gel stand with acetone acetone 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.730
 pure or any nail polish remover with 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.329
 Acetone we have at home 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.980
 they need very few things and good if you 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.079
 you have done it away from home and now 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.930
 you just do not feel like paying five 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.579
 euros for doing something so simple 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 now 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.259
 The products we will need are 10 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.380
 aluminum foil boxes does not 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.060
 they are perfectly cut 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.390
 10 pieces of cotton or discs 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.390
 cotton 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 and a orange stick 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.940
 optionally we can also use 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.700
 a block of soft lime 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.430
 and nail polish remover with acetone or acetone 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.840
 it is very important that you have acetone 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.570
 since if we do it with removes enamel 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.850
 without acetone will not do any effect 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
 First we filed the top layer of the gel 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.760
 to open the pore and that acetone 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.760
 penetrate more easily 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.150
 second moisten the disc with 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.349
 acetone or cotton and we put it on 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.450
 the nail 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.060
 I have used discs in this case 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.280
 make-up remover but I recommend it to be 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.050
 with loose pieces of cotton as it 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.880
 mold much better to the nail and is 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.270
 much more comfortable 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.430
 then we wrap the nail with the cotton 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.830
 and the aluminum foil and we leave it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.830
 act for 35 40 minutes 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.709
 after this time we removed the role of 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.590
 aluminum and we'll see that the gel has 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.330
 detached from the nail if it is not so 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.489
 we let rest a little more but for 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.420
 general rule with 40 minutes should be 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.420
 more than enough 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.990
 with the orange stick we are removing 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.160
 the remains that had remained 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.160
 attached to the nail 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.439
 and finally in a very subtle way we polish 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.329
 the nail with the four-sided block by 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.500
 If anything, we would have had some rest 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.500
 gel on the nail 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.990
 good girls this has been all for today 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.640
 I hope you have liked them 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.260
 useful result if it has been like this 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.060
