00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
lick trick if you like which I picked up

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
lick trick if you like which I picked up
from<00:00:31.019> him<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.590> his<00:00:31.800> version<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.189> tipitina

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
from him from his version of tipitina

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
from him from his version of tipitina
and<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.469> simple

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and I think it's very it's a very simple

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.970 
and I think it's very it's a very simple
lick<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.030> very<00:00:36.149> effective<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.989> it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
lick but it's very effective and it's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.590 
lick but it's very effective and it's
it's<00:00:38.309> simply<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.730> played<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it's simply not played first then you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's simply not played first then you
can<00:00:39.629> come<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.530> it's

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
is in air and this is the trick here so

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.050 
is in air and this is the trick here so
is<00:01:09.070> I<00:01:09.340> play<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.979> camera<00:01:12.250> person<00:01:12.430> yeah<00:01:12.729> you're<00:01:13.030> a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
is I play in camera person yeah you're a

bit quiet today

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.190 
bit quiet today
okay<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:36.570 

so<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:23.450> play<00:01:23.690> octaves<00:01:24.050> in<00:01:24.530> less<00:01:24.710> and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.160 

so<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.450> some<00:01:42.510> classy<00:01:43.510> guesses<00:01:43.930> on<00:01:44.050> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
so it's some classy guesses on the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.630 
so it's some classy guesses on the
trigger<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.620> does<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:44.920> descending<00:01:45.520> as

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
trigger and it does it descending as

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
trigger and it does it descending as
well

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.530 

so<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:50.710> um

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.450 

so<00:01:56.230> that's<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.590> essence<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.070> there

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
so that's the essence of it there

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.270 
so that's the essence of it there
you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:17.340 

and<00:02:06.370> then<00:02:06.550> descending

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.160 

you<00:02:18.350> can<00:02:18.530> do<00:02:18.709> with<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.069> leg

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
you can do with this leg

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.440 
you can do with this leg
is<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.400> make<00:02:21.610> an<00:02:21.790> exercise<00:02:22.030> out

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
is you can actually make an exercise out

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.870 
is you can actually make an exercise out
of<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:23.290> example<00:02:23.349> when<00:02:23.740> you're<00:02:23.860> warming<00:02:24.730> up

in the morning you could take professor
longhairs<00:02:26.590> little

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.690 

and<00:02:30.439> you<00:02:30.620> can<00:02:30.769> do<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.069> for<00:02:31.219> example<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and you can do this for example in the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.949 
and you can do this for example in the
key<00:02:31.849> of<00:02:31.909> C<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.239> can<00:02:32.360> make<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.659> chromatic

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
key of C you can make it a chromatic

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:46.180 
key of C you can make it a chromatic
thing

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.580 

and<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.310> learn<00:02:47.520> how<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.180> last<00:02:48.590> but

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
and you learn how to do it at last but

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.960 
and you learn how to do it at last but
the<00:02:49.740> essence<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> link<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.730> playing
