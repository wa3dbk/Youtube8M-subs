so first we have a bond glitch to get
out<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> map<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> under<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> map<00:00:26.609> now

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
out of the map and under the map now

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.000 
out of the map and under the map now
they<00:00:27.269> did<00:00:27.449> patch<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:28.019> they<00:00:28.349> patched<00:00:28.619> here

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
didn't pass can run jump into this okay

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.270 
didn't pass can run jump into this okay
you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.340> run<00:00:35.520> jump<00:00:36.050> from<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.649> bomb<00:00:37.829> into

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you can run jump from on the bomb into

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
you can run jump from on the bomb into
the<00:00:38.430> corner<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> corner<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the corner and some in this corner you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.160 
the corner and some in this corner you
can<00:00:40.500> hop<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.570> place<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:42.899> attack

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
can hop up and I would place your attack

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680 
can hop up and I would place your attack
down<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.250> case<00:00:44.460> cuz<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.940> fall<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> lot

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
down just in case cuz I fall off a lot

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.930 
down just in case cuz I fall off a lot
then<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> take<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.670> step

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
then you you want to take a little step

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
then you you want to take a little step
back<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> jump<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:48.960> once<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.590> up

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
back and jump up here once you're up

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.700 
back and jump up here once you're up
here<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.010> might<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.730> top<00:00:51.710> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
course the under part of the map which

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
course the under part of the map which
I'll<00:01:13.439> show<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> guys<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.610> second<00:01:15.030> does<00:01:15.390> work

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
can run around and of course the upper

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.390 
can run around and of course the upper
part<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> also<00:01:30.210> works<00:01:32.990> next<00:01:34.220> making<00:01:35.220> port

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
part of this also works next making port

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
part of this also works next making port
switch<00:01:35.610> teams<00:01:36.590> next<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
switch teams next we're gonna have the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.780 
switch teams next we're gonna have the
barrier<00:01:38.820> glitch<00:01:39.560> which<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.520> patched

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
barrier glitch which I know they patched

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.200 
barrier glitch which I know they patched
it<00:01:42.060> from<00:01:42.390> run<00:01:42.600> jumping<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.470> house<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> now

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it from run jumping on the house but now

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
it from run jumping on the house but now
there's<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.630> new<00:01:45.750> way<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> basically

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there's a new way to do it basically

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
there's a new way to do it basically
you're<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> run<00:01:48.299> down<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:49.070> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you're gonna want to run down here and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.440 
you're gonna want to run down here and
you're<00:01:50.159> gonna<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> run<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.420> way

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you're gonna want to run all the way

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.410 
you're gonna want to run all the way
over<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> ladder<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
over to the ladder and now this is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
over to the ladder and now this is
pretty<00:01:54.659> simple<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.590> takes<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.009> lot
