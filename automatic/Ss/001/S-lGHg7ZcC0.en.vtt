definitely not going to work with a full
sized<00:03:57.760> iPad<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.750> there<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.620> really<00:04:00.070> nice

sized iPad so there is a really nice
design<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.810> if<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.320> notice<00:04:02.709> it's

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
design to this and if you notice it's

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.300 
design to this and if you notice it's
really<00:04:03.430> really<00:04:03.700> simple<00:04:04.110> on-off<00:04:05.310> bluetooth

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
really really simple on-off bluetooth

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.970 
really really simple on-off bluetooth
trackback<00:04:07.090> pause<00:04:07.510> play<00:04:07.900> forward<00:04:08.440> up<00:04:08.590> down

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
trackback pause play forward up down

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.310 
trackback pause play forward up down
volume<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.910> that's<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.959> think<00:04:11.230> the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
volume and that's it and I think the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.840 
volume and that's it and I think the
idea<00:04:11.440> here<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:11.980> they<00:04:12.280> wanted<00:04:12.700> there<00:04:12.820> to

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
idea here is that they wanted there to

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.210 
idea here is that they wanted there to
be<00:04:12.970> some<00:04:13.240> simplicity<00:04:13.480> with<00:04:14.050> this<00:04:14.260> device<00:04:14.650> when

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
be some simplicity with this device when

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.190 
be some simplicity with this device when
you're<00:04:15.370> out<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.940> you're<00:04:16.209> doing<00:04:16.450> stuff<00:04:16.959> and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
you're out and you're doing stuff and

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.630 
you're out and you're doing stuff and

just you want to enjoy your music you
don't<00:04:18.940> want<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.330> have<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.600> fuss<00:04:19.810> with<00:04:19.900> tons<00:04:20.230> and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
don't want to have to fuss with tons and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.650 
don't want to have to fuss with tons and
tons<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.650> controls<00:04:21.100> this<00:04:21.850> doesn't<00:04:22.210> have<00:04:22.390> them

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
tons of controls this doesn't have them

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.740 
tons of controls this doesn't have them
it's<00:04:23.320> simple<00:04:24.040> uncomplicated<00:04:24.669> but<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.630> also

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
it's simple uncomplicated but it also

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.280 
it's simple uncomplicated but it also
just

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
just

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.440 
just
works<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.980> know<00:04:27.070> when<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.250> turn<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.640> my<00:04:27.850> music

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
I've been using this pretty much

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.250 
I've been using this pretty much
non-stop<00:04:29.710> since<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.490> arrived<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.870> just

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
non-stop since it arrived and I just

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.050

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
playing because the device that was

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.350 
playing because the device that was
paired<00:04:35.710> with<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.040> right<00:04:36.190> there<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:37.030> kind<00:04:37.270> of

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
paired with is right there that kind of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.140 
paired with is right there that kind of
simplicity<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:38.140> great<00:04:39.010> in<00:04:39.280> general<00:04:39.340> but<00:04:40.030> it's

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
simplicity is great in general but it's

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.910 
simplicity is great in general but it's
especially<00:04:40.480> great<00:04:40.810> if<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.290> have<00:04:41.500> something

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
especially great if you have something

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.920 
especially great if you have something
that's<00:04:42.070> meant<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.640> be<00:04:42.760> used<00:04:42.970> outdoors<00:04:43.300> when

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
that's meant to be used outdoors when

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.350 
that's meant to be used outdoors when
you're<00:04:44.050> out<00:04:44.230> in<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.440> battle<00:04:45.030> now<00:04:46.030> there's

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
you're out in the battle now there's

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.760 
you're out in the battle now there's
another<00:04:46.660> aspect<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.260> this<00:04:47.320> that's<00:04:47.620> really

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
another aspect of this that's really

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.220 
another aspect of this that's really
worth<00:04:48.040> noting<00:04:48.460> if<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.180> look<00:04:49.420> at<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.810> speaker

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
worth noting if you look at the speaker

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.800 
worth noting if you look at the speaker
the<00:04:50.980> grill<00:04:51.250> goes<00:04:51.640> all<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.000> way<00:04:52.270> around<00:04:52.480> the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
the grill goes all the way around the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.240 
the grill goes all the way around the
speaker<00:04:53.170> yeah<00:04:53.350> there's<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.650> little<00:04:53.890> scene

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
speaker yeah there's a little scene

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.740 
speaker yeah there's a little scene
where<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.700> two<00:04:54.730> parts<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.360> meet<00:04:55.540> but

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
where the two parts of it meet but

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.930 
where the two parts of it meet but
there's<00:04:56.170> really<00:04:56.530> no<00:04:56.890> area<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.550> doesn't<00:04:57.790> have

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
there's really no area that doesn't have

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.300 
there's really no area that doesn't have
the<00:04:58.360> grill<00:04:58.600> present<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.260> there's<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.890> reason

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the grill present and there's a reason

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.680 
the grill present and there's a reason
for<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.910> speaker<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.510> an

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
for that this speaker is an

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.810 
for that this speaker is an
omnidirectional<00:05:02.080> speaker<00:05:02.800> it<00:05:03.760> doesn't

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
omnidirectional speaker it doesn't

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
it it's going to sound the same and it's

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.780 
it it's going to sound the same and it's
going<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.440> sound<00:05:08.620> great<00:05:08.980> no<00:05:09.130> matter<00:05:09.250> where<00:05:09.580> you

going to sound great no matter where you
are<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:11.170> means<00:05:11.410> that<00:05:11.560> from<00:05:11.860> an<00:05:12.040> audio

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
are and that means that from an audio

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.970 
are and that means that from an audio
perspective<00:05:13.450> there's<00:05:13.660> no<00:05:13.810> front<00:05:14.170> or<00:05:14.380> back<00:05:14.950> to

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
perspective there's no front or back to

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.810 
perspective there's no front or back to
the<00:05:15.340> speaker

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
the speaker

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.790 
the speaker
there's<00:05:16.330> just<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.810> speaker<00:05:17.080> with<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.410> sound

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
there's just the speaker with the sound

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.310 
there's just the speaker with the sound
radiating<00:05:18.430> completely<00:05:18.940> around<00:05:19.420> it<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:19.870> the

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
radiating completely around it and the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.930 
radiating completely around it and the
way<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.770> that's<00:05:20.890> accomplished<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.730> that

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
way that that's accomplished is that

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.290 
way that that's accomplished is that
there<00:05:22.120> are<00:05:22.300> four<00:05:22.690> three-inch<00:05:23.730> drivers<00:05:24.730> inside

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
there are four three-inch drivers inside

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.870 
there are four three-inch drivers inside
this<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.870> there<00:05:26.380> are<00:05:26.500> four<00:05:26.800> base<00:05:27.190> radiators

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
this and there are four base radiators

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.660 
this and there are four base radiators
in<00:05:28.090> Drive<00:05:28.360> inside<00:05:29.020> this<00:05:29.230> so<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.400> have

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
in Drive inside this so that you have

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.550 
in Drive inside this so that you have
actually<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:32.880> driver<00:05:33.880> base<00:05:34.540> driver<00:05:35.170> based

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
actually a driver base driver based

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.970 
actually a driver base driver based
eight<00:05:36.190> all<00:05:36.730> the<00:05:37.030> way<00:05:37.120> around<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.980> then

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
eight all the way around and then

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.960 
eight all the way around and then
they're<00:05:39.280> coordinated<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:41.790> arranged<00:05:42.790> and

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
they're coordinated and arranged and

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.330 
they're coordinated and arranged and
balanced<00:05:43.750> so<00:05:43.840> that<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.290> sound<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:44.920> same

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
balanced so that the sound is the same

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.580 
balanced so that the sound is the same
no<00:05:45.580> matter<00:05:45.610> where<00:05:45.970> you<00:05:46.150> are<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.690> relationship

sounds really really good
I<00:06:18.130> used<00:06:18.790> a<00:06:18.970> less<00:06:19.360> expensive<00:06:19.750> Bluetooth

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
I used a less expensive Bluetooth

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.280 
I used a less expensive Bluetooth
speaker<00:06:20.770> last<00:06:21.100> week<00:06:21.430> for<00:06:21.670> a<00:06:21.730> while<00:06:21.910> and<00:06:22.180> it<00:06:23.140> was

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
speaker last week for a while and it was

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.170 
speaker last week for a while and it was
really<00:06:23.470> interesting<00:06:23.800> my<00:06:24.190> head<00:06:24.490> it<00:06:24.790> started

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
really interesting my head it started

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.550 
really interesting my head it started
giving<00:06:25.420> me<00:06:25.480> a<00:06:25.510> bit<00:06:25.660> of<00:06:25.750> a<00:06:25.810> headache<00:06:26.080> after<00:06:26.380> a

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
giving me a bit of a headache after a

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.620 
giving me a bit of a headache after a
time<00:06:26.740> and<00:06:26.920> I<00:06:26.950> couldn't<00:06:27.160> figure<00:06:27.310> out<00:06:27.460> why<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:28.030> I

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
time and I couldn't figure out why and I

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.000 
time and I couldn't figure out why and I
realized<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:29.170> there's<00:06:29.500> something<00:06:29.770> about

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
realized that there's something about

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.950 
realized that there's something about
when<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.520> quality<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.420> the<00:06:31.480> audio<00:06:31.570> is<00:06:31.840> now

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
when the quality of the audio is now

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.630 
when the quality of the audio is now
much<00:06:32.110> better<00:06:32.320> you're<00:06:32.890> not<00:06:33.040> working<00:06:33.400> as<00:06:33.520> hard

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
much better you're not working as hard

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.159 
much better you're not working as hard
to<00:06:33.880> listen<00:06:34.030> you're<00:06:34.360> not<00:06:34.510> working<00:06:34.840> that<00:06:34.870> hard

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
to listen you're not working that hard

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.309 
to listen you're not working that hard
as<00:06:35.440> hard<00:06:35.650> to

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 
as hard to

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.990 
as hard to
that's<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:36.949> case<00:06:37.130> with<00:06:37.280> this<00:06:37.430> speaker<00:06:37.789> for

that's the case with this speaker for

that's the case with this speaker for
sure<00:06:38.180> I've<00:06:38.720> been<00:06:38.960> using<00:06:39.139> this<00:06:39.319> non-stop<00:06:39.919> here
