Hey Mista Blu, Hum Hum, You
Can we trust you, Hum Hum, You

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
How many girls you lied before her
How had the nickname among her

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
HEY ! One lie
That you repeated your whole life

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
HEY !! she cry
and you wonder even why

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Look in her eyes
Listen her sigh

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
F-U-C-K   T-H-I-S   B-A-S-T-A-R-D

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Have you did HEY, all these little things HEY,
When she talk the ring HEY, think before the kids HEY

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
No need to draw for you to understand that she's the girl
Which is perfect, so don't let her go
You can't turn back bro

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
To-too later man, she don't come back
To-too later damn, every is so black

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
To-too later you can't, 
Understand it
You deserve a smack 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
A fuckin's slap
Prints it in your brain through this fuckin' track

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Hey Mister Mista Blu
Why don't you just think about you

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You know I'm going to speak frankly
Arrested for throwing, you would be sad, really

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Okay, now you're going to listen to me man
Today, girls start to listen to Mister Mista Wayne

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
In our day, they are more women but tomboys
They don't play with Barbies, but with all our cars and toys

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
They are no longer romantic, but cold and dry
They find all we antipathetic and request us to be sly

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Hear my advice is for you, it will be nice
it's twice as I say, love has no price 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now it's over, you think more
You go discover love, forget the war

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Does not render all that sore
Because from now it is the you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You will see that a woman
is better if the money

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And this one is perfect, don't be crazy

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Hey Mister Mista Blu
Why don't you just say I love you
