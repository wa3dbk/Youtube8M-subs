00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
we actually did is decided to use this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
we actually did is decided to use this
velcro<00:01:12.659> material<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.470> were<00:01:13.590> really

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
velcro material but we were really

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679 
velcro material but we were really
cautious<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> velcro<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:15.090> chose<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> use

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
cautious with the velcro we chose to use

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.710 
cautious with the velcro we chose to use
so<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> poly<00:01:17.220> velcro<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so we actually have the poly velcro and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
so we actually have the poly velcro and
that's<00:01:19.110> yeah<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> feel

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that's yeah if you can and if you feel

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
that's yeah if you can and if you feel
this<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.140> aggressive<00:01:22.320> velcro

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
we actually decided to start doing is

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.819 
we actually decided to start doing is
incorporating<00:01:47.790> multiple<00:01:48.030> different<00:01:48.390> colors

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
incorporating multiple different colors

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.560 
incorporating multiple different colors
so<00:01:49.829> people<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.189> switch<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:50.880> separate
