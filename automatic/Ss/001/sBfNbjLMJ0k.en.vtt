00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
whole world of all of them so avocado is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.250 
whole world of all of them so avocado is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
something else in it in the fiber of the

avocado in the meat here this flesh part
is<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.480> high<00:00:42.780> amount<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:44.090> soluble<00:00:45.090> fiber

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
is a high amount of soluble fiber

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.700 
is a high amount of soluble fiber
soluble<00:00:47.309> fiber<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> difference

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
soluble fiber now what is the difference

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.450 
soluble fiber now what is the difference
between<00:00:49.829> regular<00:00:50.820> fiber<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.289> soluble<00:00:53.160> fiber

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
between regular fiber and soluble fiber

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.279 
between regular fiber and soluble fiber
is<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.660> difference<00:00:55.110> between<00:00:55.230> night<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> day

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
is the difference between night and day

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
is the difference between night and day
regular<00:00:58.289> fiber<00:00:58.620> goes<00:00:59.399> in<00:01:00.410> goes<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
regular fiber goes in goes out it
