00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to you channel territory 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.069
 men and today I will tell you how 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.380
 rooting the stalk correctly 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 the main advantage of my method is 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.269
 the fact that the cutting is submerged in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 a certain depth that does not change 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.020
 and so for example we will plant such 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 cutting column you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.310
 for this we need a floor liter 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 glass of water foam 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.940
 So I took two types of this foam is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.579
 some kind of foam 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.309
 plastic is something like this important 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 so she swam such a piece 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 small foam rubber activated carbon 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.699
 handle scissors knife and such a tube but 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 not necessarily principle can do 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.100
 absolutely no tube and so for a start 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 prepare our solution itself 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:11.220
 take activated carbon and throw one 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 pill this is enough activated 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.340
 coal here acts as bactericidal 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 properties 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.530
 thanks to him, the plant is not engaged in 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.860
 adana blooms and stuff 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.549
 then you need to take our 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.549
 Styrofoam 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:41.250
 on this side of our cup we encircle it 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.250
 around 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.399
 It turned out about such a circle further 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 take our tubule and push through 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:16.970
 in the middle of this whole hole like this 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:19.819
 it is pressed very well 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.950
 do without the tube can be done with a knife 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.459
 Well, there will be more careful here 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.340
 we got a neat girl 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:35.239
 then take a knife and cut along the contour 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:49.580
 we didnâ€™t need any more beauty 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:03:01.570
 less cool here is such a rounder 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:01.570
 It turned out further that we need 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:17.720
 cut in half like this our 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:21.590
 foam take our pic dots like this 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:30.859
 we put foam on him and all this 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:33.160
 neatly thrust our design 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.000
 Styrofoam 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:42.290
 I got this design here 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:50.170
 Next, take our glass of water and just 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.170
 let him down a glass that's all 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:04:01.860
 here are our plants floating like flesh to 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:06.209
 as the drying of water we can it 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.690
 add a little and our plant will 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.910
 getting so much moisture you need so much 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.390
 because root is only in 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.350
 water the rest of the plant water does not 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.479
 get here is a simple method I 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.300
 rooting cuttings try who can 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.190
 like will you use her 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.380
 life 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.139
 that's all with you was the channel territory 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.370
 Men put huskies and subscribe to 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.370
