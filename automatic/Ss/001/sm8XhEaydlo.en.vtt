00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.109
 table tennis helmet conquer the tegel 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.240
 let's start a very simple basis 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.219
 Exercises I'll make you high wave too 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 from the half distance you will become equal 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.160
 Now try the first 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 Shoot balls safely then comes one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.410
 Correction of the instruction is always best 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.970
 first the arena in the forehand 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 Shoot and do everything with the posh 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 even if I'm half in the back 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 still played present always right 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:54.239
 establish it can, in principle at the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.300
 Do not strike that in the beginning of yours 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.039
 shoulders are up and still are 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.960
 on the same level are trying 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.899
 firstly, that the right one before 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.729
 is left and that you are a bit yourself 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.049
 small makes the blow because you 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.049
 do you want to buy down education 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.770
 in the under the line says 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.259
 Yes 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.259
 do you cold forward always to the end 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:37.649
 from better quote do not pull deep 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.369
 better a lot better 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.920
 Now only the problem that you have one 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.840
 very long lever of your answer is you 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 you can shoot more out of it 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 think forearm and that here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.229
 this is much more power than that 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.549
 it this long first massive I 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.340
 I could rather hit the ground 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.649
 focus has'll save if applied 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.110
 So you distance with the elbow 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.280
 in the body and then only here 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.810
 like a little one from 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.190
 important here purely flap and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.650
 go down a bit at the same time 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.480
 I did not put those first 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.829
 again the balls only on the point you 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.519
 Try the joint 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.519
 use 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.780
 to go even further 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:03:16.480
 and so here must be the club after 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.549
 down and inside before but not 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.639
 necessarily this long here 110 of the 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.349
 poor remains so almost stand and more 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.689
 from the forearm that works now 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:31.780
 just then you will see it now 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:35.430
 even more energy produces more 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.430
 let's hit really hard 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:54.150
 minor movement from top to bottom 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.199
 you have to man you have him too much 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.199
 Closed is not a top 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.249
 undecided 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.680
 he realizes if he has so decided 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.279
 and you make a hand and be under 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.409
 if you have a neutral then too 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.979
 no slow soon the first works 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.050
 forward 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.000
 So that's the control if he's like that 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.000
 very falling down have closed 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:31.539
 that's exactly why he's down 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.689
 no reason when you go down only 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.650
 has a high hit of the 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:44.710
 lower the elbows a bit deeper 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:45.099
 and you only need that lever 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:06:01.949
 here 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:06:10.919
 the bang and then down 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:10.919
 even steeper down and then down down 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.719
 and top down that in any case 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.360
 still problems because the right angle 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:20.979
 get out and where the move 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.270
 ever does that finds it scary 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.719
 difficult from the right starting point too 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.300
 Find 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:27.009
 we'll do it all this time 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.719
 methodical make the next exercise 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.129
 because I can do it all though 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.770
 colleges you need it myself once 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.940
 experience and feel what is important in 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.750
 So the next exercise will do one 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.750
 methodical exercise
