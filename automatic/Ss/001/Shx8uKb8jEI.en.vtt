00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 a habit that for him has 98 but 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 delivered a tutorial to make a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.469
 duplicate of piteros well this one does not 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.450
 I think it works completely this 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.340
 2014 not 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.700
 and first tps that lives it this one 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.830
 Portuguese and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.940
 since I leave the original video in the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.370
 description of your channel so you can see it 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.040
 good let's start I'm tried with 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.310
 several items like the like the diamond the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.310
 gold 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.460
 and the metal and the trains worked and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.120
 another block I tried with the lover block 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.700
 but well this is you have to do it 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.770
 many times because sometimes the result 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.640
 but it's worth it 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.560
 good for some things to store things 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.870
 or holes 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.540
 the first thing we need is toledo 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.510
 2000 sure that nothing happens 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.850
 now we are going to help everything 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.410
 we need and left it in the description 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 so we save but like that and 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.360
 we make a block three by three and we 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:23.010
 we put in like this like this like that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 now we put around like that like that like that 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.380
 A) Yes 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:34.750
 well and now we put confusion 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:38.870
 we could like that so like that so like this so in 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:46.730
 plan that like a year a day or not 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:50.630
 now we grab dry wood wood 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.990
 we put where height 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.140
 after abstinence need 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.140
 we give a shower of remains 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.940
 and now we will make a button that we see here 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:14.160
 now we put a wood here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.240
 and here we put everything repeated to Spain if 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.690
 well like this and now in networks to be 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:29.180
 so so so itself and we will put 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:32.260
 of four tics like that so like that so like that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.520
 so so 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.000
 now let's put two of wood here 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.800
 although it has to be for morrison 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.790
 we put one here 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.020
 although we put a rest torch 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.180
 as embarking like this 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.980
 It's very funny but do not take me into account 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.100
 important and we can a repeater 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.080
 looking over there and we put it to 3 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.370
 sticks so be textile 2 in 2 click 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.860
 right and moves up here that would be 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.040
 one two three four and up to the third 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.569
 no and now what is missing is this 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.609
 we threw ourselves and we grabbed tnt and 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:22.340
 jumpers there are no thinkers artists 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:25.579
 that have happy faces if we put 30 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.189
 and also a welder is here and 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.220
 we save what we want to double by 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:34.150
 example diamond we did not stop and we 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.150
 we put in survival 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.890
 well here they have to wait more or less 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.710
 or is he explained that he already put 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.150
 keep the button and this expert to the 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.490
 thing the retreat do not be afraid because 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.440
 you do not lose diamonds and you lose the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.190
 times the result in this period already 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.580
 keep so do not worry about 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.819
 about 5 seconds 50 types one two 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.370
 three 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.750
 45 pink the other is more or less this 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.030
 silence does not work you have to 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.390
 do it several times because to me too 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.900
 the jump and as to the third or fourth 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.419
 once it worked out well and it worked well 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.530
 to do so we will grab you already own 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.630
 the registration 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:29.530
 we see the button 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.360
 1 2 3 4 5 and it works now again a 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.100
 month in the whole result sometimes 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.850
 the diamond works 1 2 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.850
 4 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.890
 for what 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.430
 the time it will be like that until 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.430
 works 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.569
 ah 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.340

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:17.110
 Pride worked after 5500 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.540
 attempts worked 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.900

 also 1.51 also works 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.370

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:04.250
 and I hope it is liked to vote 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:08.020
 They do not like this one because 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.020
 tripled is because there's a lot 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.129
