wow<00:06:54.429> that<00:06:55.429> was<00:06:55.549> terrible<00:06:59.499> yeah<00:07:00.499> um<00:07:02.799> so<00:07:03.799> I'm

00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:04.119 
wow that was terrible yeah um so I'm

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.899

basically<00:07:05.119> it<00:07:05.539> you<00:07:06.259> have<00:07:06.439> that<00:07:06.979> and<00:07:07.279> then<00:07:07.669> you

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:07.909 
basically it you have that and then you

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.119 
basically it you have that and then you
open<00:07:08.059> your<00:07:08.299> hand<00:07:08.449> shoe<00:07:08.719> left<00:07:09.229> and<00:07:09.469> up<00:07:09.709> and<00:07:09.979> then

open your hand shoe left and up and then

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.929 
open your hand shoe left and up and then
that<00:07:10.309> determines<00:07:11.209> where<00:07:11.419> you<00:07:11.509> look<00:07:11.689> in<00:07:12.519> so<00:07:13.519> if
