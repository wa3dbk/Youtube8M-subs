the iron sights with the ak-47 are not
too<00:00:41.610> forgiving<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> yeah<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:44.850> aim<00:00:45.000> will

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
too forgiving so so yeah but my aim will

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
too forgiving so so yeah but my aim will
get<00:00:45.300> better<00:00:45.510> throughout<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> gameplay<00:00:46.770> so

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

this is the map stockpile and in my

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
this is the map stockpile and in my
opinion<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.960> problems<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
opinion there are a lot of problems with

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100

gonna be and this is where most of your
gun<00:01:23.850> battles<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.229> place<00:01:25.439> now

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
gun battles are going to take place now

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
gun battles are going to take place now
this<00:01:26.549> side<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> map<00:01:27.270> where<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.750> spawn<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
this side of the map where I spawn you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
this side of the map where I spawn you
don't<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> go<00:01:29.700> down<00:01:29.729> towards<00:01:30.329> it

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
don't really want to go down towards it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.190 
don't really want to go down towards it
because<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.979> very<00:01:32.250> open<00:01:32.520> area<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.659> it's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because it's a very open area and it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
because it's a very open area and it's
pretty<00:01:34.439> hard<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.070> see<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.790> opponent<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
pretty hard to see your opponent all the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.200 
pretty hard to see your opponent all the
way<00:01:36.750> down<00:01:37.020> towards<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.799> other<00:01:38.009> side<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.880> if

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
way down towards the other side so if

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
way down towards the other side so if
you<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> sniper<00:01:39.960> rifle<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.920> very

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you have a sniper rifle and it's very

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.179 
you have a sniper rifle and it's very
advantageous<00:01:41.689> compared<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> having<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.380> SMG

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
advantageous compared to having an SMG

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
advantageous compared to having an SMG
or<00:01:44.549> an<00:01:44.700> assault<00:01:45.030> rifle<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.409> into

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
or an assault rifle so I go back into

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
or an assault rifle so I go back into
this<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.189> building<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.180> as

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this little building right here and as

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.770 
this little building right here and as
you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.920> tell<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> spots

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you can tell there are a lot of spots

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.560 
you can tell there are a lot of spots
where<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.140> camp<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.399> kind<00:01:54.390> of

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
where you can camp so this is kind of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.749 
where you can camp so this is kind of
bad<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.189> part<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> map

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
bad but you know it's a part of the map

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
bad but you know it's a part of the map
you<00:01:57.000> can't<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.570> anything<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.229> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can't really do anything about it so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.959 
you can't really do anything about it so
I'm<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.189> head<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.490> into<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.909> little

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
I'm about to head up into this little

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
I'm about to head up into this little
area<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.990> usually<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.770> campers

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
area right here and usually what campers

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.740 
area right here and usually what campers
would<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> they'd<00:02:02.820> lay<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> claymore<00:02:03.540> where

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
would do is they'd lay a claymore where

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
would do is they'd lay a claymore where
I<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.930> about<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> guess<00:02:05.219> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I was about to put one but I guess I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.289 
I was about to put one but I guess I
didn't<00:02:05.579> put<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.119> there

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
didn't put it there

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.350 
didn't put it there
and<00:02:06.829> they'll<00:02:07.829> go<00:02:07.979> into<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.369> room<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.879> they

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
and they'll go into this room and they

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.059 
and they'll go into this room and they
will<00:02:09.509> stay<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.080> window<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
will stay at this window so this is a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.240 
will stay at this window so this is a
very<00:02:11.459> camp

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
very camp

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.000 
very camp
friendly<00:02:12.610> spot<00:02:13.320> usually<00:02:14.320> what<00:02:14.530> would<00:02:14.680> happen

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
friendly spot usually what would happen

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.800 
friendly spot usually what would happen
you<00:02:15.040> would<00:02:15.280> spawn<00:02:16.060> right<00:02:16.300> next<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.690> this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you would spawn right next to this

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.600 
you would spawn right next to this
little<00:02:16.870> church<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.920> left<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.280> me<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
little church to the left of me and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.760 
little church to the left of me and
someone<00:02:19.570> will<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:19.750> be<00:02:20.020> hiding<00:02:20.230> inside<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
someone will just be hiding inside the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.100 
someone will just be hiding inside the
window<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:22.180> careful<00:02:22.510> about<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.750> when<00:02:23.020> you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
window so be careful about that when you

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.930 
window so be careful about that when you
guys<00:02:23.230> buy<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.530> escalation<00:02:23.980> map<00:02:24.220> pack<00:02:24.430> so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
guys buy the escalation map pack so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.400 
guys buy the escalation map pack so
everything<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.510> based<00:02:25.720> around<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.170> little

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
everything is based around this little

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.680 
everything is based around this little
building<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.490> see<00:02:27.760> everyone<00:02:28.150> trying<00:02:28.600> to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
building so you see everyone trying to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.570 
building so you see everyone trying to
come<00:02:28.930> into<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.290> building<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.010> whoever<00:02:30.310> has

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
come into the building so whoever has

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460 
come into the building so whoever has
control<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.300> building<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.900> basically

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
control of the building is basically

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.590 
control of the building is basically
going<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.890> win<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> match<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.850> that's<00:02:34.330> one

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
going to win the match and that's one

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.750 
going to win the match and that's one
bad<00:02:34.810> thing<00:02:34.840> about<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.650> map<00:02:35.920> right<00:02:36.070> here<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
bad thing about this map right here and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.430 
bad thing about this map right here and
as<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.940> see<00:02:37.150> someone<00:02:37.420> opened<00:02:37.870> up<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.170> door

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
as you see someone opened up that door

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.280 
as you see someone opened up that door
the<00:02:39.400> thing<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.850> door<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.390> someone

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the thing with this door is someone

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.780 
the thing with this door is someone
could<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.740> waiting<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> other<00:02:42.430> side

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
could just be waiting on the other side

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.300 
could just be waiting on the other side
of<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.000> door<00:02:43.180> unexpectedly<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.709> just<00:02:45.190> can

pop you in the foot going easily and get
it<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.770> easy<00:02:47.950> kill<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.730> that's<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
it and really easy kill and that's a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.880 
it and really easy kill and that's a
really<00:02:49.150> bad<00:02:49.270> thing<00:02:49.510> about<00:02:49.600> these<00:02:49.870> doors<00:02:50.110> and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
really bad thing about these doors and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.100 
really bad thing about these doors and
there's<00:02:51.190> one<00:02:51.520> other<00:02:51.940> door<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.750> other<00:02:52.870> side

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
there's one other door on the other side

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.010 
there's one other door on the other side
of<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.739> factory<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.690> make<00:02:55.840> way

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
of the factory so that just make way

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.320 
of the factory so that just make way
basically<00:02:56.440> makes<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:57.250> little<00:02:57.520> area<00:02:57.850> this

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
basically makes this little area this

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.479 
basically makes this little area this
little<00:02:58.510> fact<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.410> most<00:02:59.650> crucial<00:03:00.070> point<00:03:00.310> of

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
little fact on the most crucial point of

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.460 
little fact on the most crucial point of
the<00:03:00.610> map<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.000> right<00:03:01.510> here<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.720> call<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.320> my

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the map and right here I call in my

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.530 
the map and right here I call in my
chopper<00:03:03.010> gunner<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.430> my<00:03:03.700> attack<00:03:04.030> dogs<00:03:04.239> at<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
chopper gunner and my attack dogs at the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.390 
chopper gunner and my attack dogs at the
same<00:03:04.720> time<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.590> haven't<00:03:05.920> explained<00:03:06.310> why

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
same time and I haven't explained why

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.430 
same time and I haven't explained why
I've<00:03:06.700> done<00:03:06.910> this<00:03:07.090> yet<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.959> reason<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.380> do

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
I've done this yet and the reason I do

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.370 
I've done this yet and the reason I do
this<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:09.190> because<00:03:09.360> since<00:03:10.360> these<00:03:10.660> maps<00:03:11.020> are

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
this is because since these maps are

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.949 
this is because since these maps are
very<00:03:11.440> camper<00:03:12.250> friendly<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.940> let<00:03:13.450> my<00:03:13.600> attack

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
very camper friendly I let my attack

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.229 
very camper friendly I let my attack
dogs<00:03:14.260> go<00:03:14.739> ahead<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.160> try<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.400> kill<00:03:15.730> all<00:03:15.760> those

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
dogs go ahead and try to kill all those

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.050 
dogs go ahead and try to kill all those
campers<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.190> once<00:03:18.190> they<00:03:18.340> kill<00:03:18.580> those<00:03:18.670> campers

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
campers and once they kill those campers

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.820 
campers and once they kill those campers
they're<00:03:19.239> eager<00:03:19.510> they're<00:03:20.019> either<00:03:20.200> gonna<00:03:20.440> spawn

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
they're eager they're either gonna spawn

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.460 
they're eager they're either gonna spawn
outside<00:03:21.489> or<00:03:21.790> they're<00:03:22.269> gonna<00:03:22.330> force<00:03:22.750> them<00:03:23.019> to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
outside or they're gonna force them to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.140 
outside or they're gonna force them to
run<00:03:23.769> around<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.190> go<00:03:24.310> outside<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:25.000> gonna

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
run around and go outside so it's gonna

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.000 
run around and go outside so it's gonna
confuse<00:03:25.450> all<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.110> these<00:03:26.230> people<00:03:26.620> all<00:03:26.830> together

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
confuse all of these people all together

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.970 
confuse all of these people all together
and<00:03:27.610> once<00:03:28.420> they<00:03:28.570> go<00:03:28.690> outside<00:03:29.049> I<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.530> just<00:03:29.739> go

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
and once they go outside I can just go

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.190 
and once they go outside I can just go
ahead<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.489> rape<00:03:31.269> them<00:03:31.450> with<00:03:31.660> my<00:03:31.840> chopper

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
ahead and rape them with my chopper

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.990 
ahead and rape them with my chopper
gunner<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.070> really<00:03:33.310> good<00:03:33.459> tactic<00:03:33.850> to

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
gunner this is a really good tactic to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.880 
gunner this is a really good tactic to
use<00:03:34.030> I've<00:03:34.420> tried<00:03:34.750> using<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.350> chopper<00:03:35.709> gunner

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
use I've tried using the chopper gunner

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.820 
use I've tried using the chopper gunner
and<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.580> TAC<00:03:37.330> dogs<00:03:37.630> at<00:03:37.840> different<00:03:38.320> times<00:03:38.560> and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
and the TAC dogs at different times and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.130 
and the TAC dogs at different times and
the<00:03:39.130> thing<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:39.940> your<00:03:40.360> opponent<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:40.900> gonna

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
the thing is that your opponent is gonna

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.470 
the thing is that your opponent is gonna
focus<00:03:41.410> more<00:03:41.890> on<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.250> taking<00:03:43.150> down<00:03:43.299> your

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
focus more on like taking down your

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.390 
focus more on like taking down your
chopper<00:03:43.780> gunner<00:03:43.959> or<00:03:44.290> trying<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.130> shoot<00:03:45.370> down

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
chopper gunner or trying to shoot down

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.660 
chopper gunner or trying to shoot down
the<00:03:45.610> attack<00:03:46.060> dogs<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:47.200> when<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.250> have<00:03:48.430> both<00:03:48.640> of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
the attack dogs so when you have both of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.610 
the attack dogs so when you have both of
these<00:03:48.940> kill<00:03:49.299> streaks<00:03:49.570> up<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.049> gonna<00:03:50.350> confuse

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
these kill streaks up it's gonna confuse

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.710 
these kill streaks up it's gonna confuse
the<00:03:50.980> hell<00:03:51.160> out<00:03:51.190> of<00:03:51.340> them<00:03:51.549> now<00:03:52.150> through<00:03:52.600> my

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the hell out of them now through my

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.900 
the hell out of them now through my
previous<00:03:53.230> videos<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.620> talked<00:03:53.890> about<00:03:54.160> Hotel<00:03:54.519> and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
previous videos I talked about Hotel and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.940 
previous videos I talked about Hotel and
convoy<00:03:55.900> being<00:03:56.590> very<00:03:57.220> colorful<00:03:57.790> compared<00:03:58.480> to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
convoy being very colorful compared to

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.350 
convoy being very colorful compared to
the<00:03:59.950> maps<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.310> track<00:04:00.640> usually<00:04:00.970> brings<00:04:01.209> out

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
the maps that track usually brings out

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.650 
the maps that track usually brings out
but<00:04:01.989> stockpile<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.920> more<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.940> tree<00:04:04.329> or<00:04:04.360> Koosh

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
but stockpile is more of a tree or Koosh

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.930 
but stockpile is more of a tree or Koosh
map<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.440> color<00:04:05.680> level<00:04:06.100> looks<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.370> lot<00:04:06.519> like<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
map the color level looks a lot like the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.140 
map the color level looks a lot like the
zoo<00:04:07.120> oh<00:04:07.360> by<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.930> way<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.430> decided<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.700> stop<00:04:09.970> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
zoo oh by the way I decided to stop the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.819 
zoo oh by the way I decided to stop the
color<00:04:10.329> correction<00:04:10.690> because<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.680> just

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
color correction because it just

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.000 
color correction because it just
deviates<00:04:12.400> from<00:04:12.750> like<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.930> natural<00:04:14.140> gameplay

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
deviates from like the natural gameplay

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.370 
deviates from like the natural gameplay
that<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.790> usually<00:04:16.180> get<00:04:16.329> like<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:16.810> my<00:04:17.200> hotel

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
that I usually get like in my hotel

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.990 
that I usually get like in my hotel
video<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.979> black<00:04:18.220> levels<00:04:18.609> were<00:04:18.729> pretty

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
video the black levels were pretty

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.860 
video the black levels were pretty
horrible

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
horrible

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050 
horrible
I<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.829> think<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.160> if<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.579> keep<00:04:21.880> using

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
I just think that if I just keep using

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.550 
I just think that if I just keep using
this<00:04:22.240> color<00:04:22.449> correction<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.050> white<00:04:23.199> levels

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
this color correction the white levels

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.650 
this color correction the white levels
would<00:04:23.650> be<00:04:23.710> horrible<00:04:24.610> as<00:04:24.729> well<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.449> I'm<00:04:25.630> just

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
would be horrible as well so I'm just

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.930 
would be horrible as well so I'm just
not<00:04:25.930> gonna<00:04:26.260> do<00:04:26.500> anything<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.340> video<00:04:27.639> cuz

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
not gonna do anything to the video cuz

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.730 
not gonna do anything to the video cuz
it<00:04:28.060> looks<00:04:28.210> pretty<00:04:28.510> good<00:04:28.720> by<00:04:28.840> itself<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.560> once

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
it looks pretty good by itself so once

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.290 
it looks pretty good by itself so once
again<00:04:29.860> since<00:04:30.370> I'm<00:04:30.490> going<00:04:30.729> down<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.030> side<00:04:31.270> I

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
again since I'm going down the side I

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.570 
again since I'm going down the side I
don't<00:04:31.479> want<00:04:31.750> to<00:04:31.870> get<00:04:32.470> killed<00:04:32.710> by<00:04:32.800> any<00:04:33.100> snipers

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
don't want to get killed by any snipers

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.310 
don't want to get killed by any snipers
or<00:04:33.699> anything<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.389> other<00:04:34.570> side<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:34.930> actually

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
or anything the other side is actually

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.860 
or anything the other side is actually
pretty<00:04:35.590> good<00:04:35.710> it's<00:04:36.520> not<00:04:36.699> really<00:04:37.060> as<00:04:37.210> open<00:04:37.660> as

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
pretty good it's not really as open as

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.200 
pretty good it's not really as open as
the<00:04:38.530> side<00:04:38.740> where<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.070> spawned<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.120> I'm

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
the side where I just spawned so I'm

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.879 
the side where I just spawned so I'm
going<00:04:40.479> into<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.320> middle<00:04:41.530> of<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.710> factory

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
going into the the middle of the factory

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.700 
going into the the middle of the factory
again<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.669> basically<00:04:43.630> this<00:04:44.139> is<00:04:44.290> how<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.470> gain

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
again and basically this is how you gain

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.020 
again and basically this is how you gain
control<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> map<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.400> going<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.880> move

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
control of the map just going to move

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.159 
control of the map just going to move
the<00:04:46.150> factory<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.600> make<00:04:46.720> sure<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.990> you

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
the factory and make sure that you

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.870 
the factory and make sure that you
control<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.889> see<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.280> there<00:04:48.520> was

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
control it and you see that there was

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.629 
control it and you see that there was
someone<00:04:49.470> camping<00:04:50.470> up<00:04:50.650> top<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.400> ledge

still<00:05:29.860> still<00:05:30.820> trying<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.240> find<00:05:31.870> out<00:05:32.020> better

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
still still trying to find out better

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.550 
still still trying to find out better
strategies<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:34.000> use<00:05:34.270> because<00:05:34.900> it's<00:05:35.229> a<00:05:35.289> super

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
strategies to use because it's a super

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.680 
strategies to use because it's a super
huge<00:05:35.800> amount<00:05:36.099> and<00:05:36.340> it's<00:05:36.940> definitely<00:05:37.419> meant

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
huge amount and it's definitely meant

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.990 
huge amount and it's definitely meant
for<00:05:37.810> four<00:05:38.260> players<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.950> this<00:05:39.490> is<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.669> reason

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
for four players and this is the reason

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.570 
for four players and this is the reason
why<00:05:40.120> I<00:05:40.180> told<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.990> not<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.320> go<00:05:41.979> down<00:05:42.160> towards

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
why I told you not to go down towards

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.670 
why I told you not to go down towards
this<00:05:42.669> way<00:05:42.849> because<00:05:43.090> that<00:05:43.510> one<00:05:43.840> dude<00:05:44.229> killed<00:05:44.530> me

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
this way because that one dude killed me

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.860 
this way because that one dude killed me
I<00:05:44.710> could<00:05:44.950> have<00:05:45.070> had<00:05:45.280> a<00:05:45.610> gameplay<00:05:46.330> that<00:05:46.360> was<00:05:46.570> 40

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
I could have had a gameplay that was 40

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.529 
I could have had a gameplay that was 40
and<00:05:46.930> -<00:05:47.110> but<00:05:47.830> no<00:05:48.039> I<00:05:48.070> ended<00:05:48.669> up<00:05:48.910> with<00:05:49.419> another

and - but no I ended up with another

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.290 
and - but no I ended up with another
death<00:05:49.960> so<00:05:50.289> I<00:05:50.530> ended<00:05:50.889> the<00:05:51.010> game<00:05:51.130> with<00:05:51.340> 40<00:05:51.699> kills

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
death so I ended the game with 40 kills

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.200 
death so I ended the game with 40 kills
and<00:05:52.599> three<00:05:52.870> deaths<00:05:53.169> pretty<00:05:54.070> good<00:05:54.340> game<00:05:54.669> I
