and this episode as well is gonna be
quite<00:00:20.970> advanced<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.320> gonna<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.590> thrown<00:00:22.830> in

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
quite advanced so I'm gonna be thrown in

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.320 
quite advanced so I'm gonna be thrown in
like<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> Pekka<00:00:23.340> snare<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> stuff<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.150> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
like the Pekka snare and stuff like that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
like the Pekka snare and stuff like that
so<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> can't<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.500> don't<00:00:25.740> worry

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
so if you can't do them like don't worry

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.800 
so if you can't do them like don't worry
about<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> can't<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> beat

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
about it and if you can't do the beat

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.630 
about it and if you can't do the beat
straightaway<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:29.160> totally<00:00:29.340> fine

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
straightaway then that's totally fine

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
straightaway then that's totally fine
because<00:00:29.730> these<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.029> quite<00:00:30.150> advanced<00:00:30.689> because

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
because these are quite advanced because

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
because these are quite advanced because
the<00:00:31.679> tkk<00:00:32.189> combo<00:00:32.520> makes<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:34.110> know

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the tkk combo makes it like you know

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.580 
the tkk combo makes it like you know
quite<00:00:34.559> technical<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.750> these<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.110> well

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
quite technical so these are not well

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.290 
quite technical so these are not well
this<00:00:37.739> episode<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.460> particular<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.149> going

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this episode in particular is not going

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.700 
this episode in particular is not going
to<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.230> sound<00:00:40.469> that's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to you know just have the sound that's

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.200 
to you know just have the sound that's
in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> tile<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.180> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in the tile and then you know like a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
in the tile and then you know like a
basic<00:00:42.719> thing<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.320> gonna<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.500> quite

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
basic thing so this is gonna be quite

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.069 
basic thing so this is gonna be quite
advanced<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.730> tkk<00:00:45.180> combo<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.780> quite

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
advanced because the tkk combo is quite

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
advanced because the tkk combo is quite
advanced<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.559> itself<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.160> anyway<00:00:47.760> without<00:00:47.879> me

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
advanced in itself so anyway without me

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.150 
advanced in itself so anyway without me
rumbling<00:00:48.390> i'm<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:49.829> beat<00:00:50.010> this

rumbling i'm this is the first beat this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680 
rumbling i'm this is the first beat this
is<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> combo<00:00:51.000> rather<00:00:51.270> than<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> beat

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
is more of a combo rather than a beat

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
is more of a combo rather than a beat
but<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.140> nice<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the first beat and I slowed down it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.090 
the first beat and I slowed down it
sound<00:01:04.049> something<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:09.470> yeah<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.680> actually

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
say I made that up myself because I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
say I made that up myself because I
haven't<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.700> heard<00:01:14.820> anyone<00:01:15.600> else<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
haven't really heard anyone else do it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
haven't really heard anyone else do it
and<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.590> did<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> randomly<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.369> was

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.710 
and I just did it randomly and I was
like<00:01:17.549> oh<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> song<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.180> nice<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> it

like oh that song is very nice and it
flows<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.200> well<00:01:19.320> snow<00:01:19.619> anyway<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
flows really well snow anyway so the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
flows really well snow anyway so the
second<00:01:21.390> thing<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.659> show<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.110> more

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
of an actual beat rather than a combo

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.450 
of an actual beat rather than a combo
but<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.170> learn<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> showed

but if you can learn that what I showed

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
but if you can learn that what I showed
you<00:01:26.490> previously<00:01:26.610> you'll<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.509> able<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> use

you previously you'll be able to use

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.310 
you previously you'll be able to use
your<00:01:28.020> BTK<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> beat<00:01:29.820> T<00:01:30.299> care<00:01:30.570> okay<00:01:30.960> combo

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
your BTK with the beat T care okay combo

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.499 
your BTK with the beat T care okay combo
okay<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> you'll<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> able<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> use

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
okay that's it you'll be able to use

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.480 
okay that's it you'll be able to use
that<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.840> quite<00:01:34.170> nicely<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.100> know

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that like quite nicely in this I know

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
that like quite nicely in this I know
where<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> second<00:01:35.939> thing<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.500> slow

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
where the second thing is and then slow

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.539 
where the second thing is and then slow
down<00:01:43.770> it'll<00:01:44.130> sound<00:01:44.250> something<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.700> this

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.280 

so<00:01:53.549> something<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> quite

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
so something like that so that is quite

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
so something like that so that is quite
simple<00:01:55.649> when<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.920> break<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.250> down<00:01:56.369> all<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.729> is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
simple when you break it down all it is

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
simple when you break it down all it is
is<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.000> putting<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> tkk<00:01:58.079> combo<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.590> between

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
is just putting the tkk combo in between

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179 
is just putting the tkk combo in between
them<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.090> basically<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:01.189> so

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
them and that's basically it really so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.209 
them and that's basically it really so
that<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.270> definitely<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.680> helpful<00:02:05.189> for

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that is definitely really helpful for

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.730 
that is definitely really helpful for
understanding<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.119> TK<00:02:06.659> combo<00:02:07.110> anyway<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.469> if

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
understanding the TK combo anyway so if

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.990 
understanding the TK combo anyway so if
you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.069> down<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.610> basically

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you can get that down then you basically

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.729 
you can get that down then you basically
mastered<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> can

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
mastered it because it you know you can

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.750 
mastered it because it you know you can
learn<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> roll<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> quite<00:02:11.580> nicely<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
learn to roll it quite nicely so

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.520 
learn to roll it quite nicely so
