00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
be expected as this is a radical

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.740 
be expected as this is a radical
departure<00:00:07.529> from<00:00:08.340> what<00:00:08.400> we've<00:00:08.670> seen<00:00:08.700> before<00:00:09.150> or

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
departure from what we've seen before or

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.780 
departure from what we've seen before or
is<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.559> mean<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.010> image<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.519> very

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
is it I mean this image is very

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.910 
is it I mean this image is very
reminiscent<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.540> The<00:00:12.750> Killing<00:00:12.960> Joke<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
reminiscent of The Killing Joke and the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.150 
reminiscent of The Killing Joke and the
Joker<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.580> general<00:00:15.150> white<00:00:15.630> skin<00:00:16.109> green<00:00:16.800> hair

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.939 
Joker in general white skin green hair
crazy<00:00:17.910> face<00:00:18.510> even<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> Joker<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.619> tattoos

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.500 
crazy face even the Joker with tattoos
we've<00:00:20.520> seen<00:00:20.850> before

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
we've seen before

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.880 
we've seen before
as<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> teeth<00:00:22.170> well<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.500> guess<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.769> makes

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
as for the teeth well I guess that makes

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.679 
as for the teeth well I guess that makes
sense<00:00:23.460> Batman<00:00:23.820> would<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.090> knocked<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.539> out

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
sense Batman would have knocked them out

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.220 
sense Batman would have knocked them out
so<00:00:25.500> many<00:00:25.859> times<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.730> reality<00:00:27.390> probably<00:00:27.720> every

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
so many times in reality probably every

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.019 
so many times in reality probably every
time<00:00:28.470> he<00:00:28.680> sees<00:00:28.949> him<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> mention<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
time he sees him not to mention the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780 
time he sees him not to mention the
Joker<00:00:30.359> has<00:00:30.510> had<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.990> slew<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> looks<00:00:32.130> over<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
years and for each one you could

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
years and for each one you could
probably<00:00:34.469> pick<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.890> something<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.120> someone

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
probably pick out something that someone

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.959 
probably pick out something that someone
might<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.800> he's<00:00:38.010> great<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

on<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.530> Leto<00:01:13.920> plays<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> role<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.299> judging

probably<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> guess<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> point<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
probably and I guess the point of the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
probably and I guess the point of the
Joker<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.610> been<00:01:20.909> interpreted<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Joker is he has been interpreted and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.130 
Joker is he has been interpreted and
then<00:01:22.110> reinterpreted<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.759> many<00:01:24.119> times<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
then reinterpreted so many times to the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.719 
then reinterpreted so many times to the
point<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.560> even<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.250> works<00:01:26.430> or

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
point where even if this one works or

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
point where even if this one works or
not<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.540> doesn't<00:01:27.840> matter<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.409> changed<00:01:28.799> again

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
