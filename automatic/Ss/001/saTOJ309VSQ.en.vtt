00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
like Microsoft might be actually

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
on the Xbox one this could also help

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.750 
on the Xbox one this could also help
with<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.620> smart<00:00:36.040> match<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.460> things<00:00:36.610> like

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
with the smart match and things like

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.260 
with the smart match and things like

the November SDK leaked Microsoft is

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.920 
the November SDK leaked Microsoft is
redoing<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.580> entire<00:00:42.610> multiplayer<00:00:43.450> system

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
redoing the entire multiplayer system

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.140 
redoing the entire multiplayer system
specifically<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:44.980> party<00:00:45.489> structure<00:00:45.790> and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
specifically the party structure and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.970 
specifically the party structure and
they<00:00:46.239> are<00:00:46.300> called<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.660> new<00:00:46.809> system<00:00:47.200> 2015

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
they are called a new system 2015

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.220 
they are called a new system 2015
multiplayer<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.730> basically<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.960> way<00:00:50.080> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
multiplayer and basically the way the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.900 
multiplayer and basically the way the
old<00:00:50.470> multiplayer<00:00:51.070> work<00:00:51.280> was<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.699> was<00:00:51.790> all

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
old multiplayer work was it was all

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.540 
old multiplayer work was it was all
based<00:00:52.120> on<00:00:52.330> your<00:00:52.480> party<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.310> matchmaking<00:00:54.310> was

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
based on your party and matchmaking was

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.240 
based on your party and matchmaking was
driven<00:00:54.760> by<00:00:55.000> game<00:00:55.239> party<00:00:55.630> membership<00:00:56.250> whereas

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
driven by game party membership whereas

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.520 
driven by game party membership whereas
the<00:00:57.430> 2015<00:00:58.300> multiplayer<00:00:58.810> design<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.350> most

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
the 2015 multiplayer design the most

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.340 
the 2015 multiplayer design the most
obvious<00:00:59.770> change<00:01:00.340> will<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.660> it<00:01:02.050> no<00:01:02.200> longer

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
obvious change will be the it no longer

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.139 
obvious change will be the it no longer
need<00:01:02.829> access<00:01:03.130> to<00:01:03.399> multiplayer<00:01:03.940> functionality

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
need access to multiplayer functionality

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.510 
need access to multiplayer functionality
through<00:01:04.750> game<00:01:04.989> parties<00:01:05.410> instead<00:01:06.190> they<00:01:06.369> can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
through game parties instead they can

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.310 
through game parties instead they can
now<00:01:06.700> perform<00:01:06.910> all<00:01:07.330> multiplayer<00:01:07.720> related

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
now perform all multiplayer related

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.340 
now perform all multiplayer related
operations<00:01:08.560> directly<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.229> basically<00:01:11.229> it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
operations directly so basically it's

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.340 
operations directly so basically it's
going<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.530> take<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.830> whole<00:01:11.979> party<00:01:13.080> system<00:01:14.080> and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
going to take the whole party system and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.070 
going to take the whole party system and
turn<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.190> on<00:01:15.340> its<00:01:15.490> side<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:16.060> way<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.630> came<00:01:16.899> to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
turn it on its side that way it came to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.780 
turn it on its side that way it came to
help<00:01:17.200> revolutionize<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.280> make<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.610> much

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
help revolutionize and make it much

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.020 
help revolutionize and make it much
quicker<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.869> get<00:01:20.170> back<00:01:20.350> in<00:01:20.649> load<00:01:21.250> up<00:01:21.460> into

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
quicker to get back in load up into

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.030 
quicker to get back in load up into
games<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.690> things<00:01:22.780> like<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
games and things like that and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.650 
games and things like that and
apparently<00:01:24.430> there's<00:01:24.850> some<00:01:24.910> theories<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.569> I'm

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
apparently there's some theories and I'm

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.639 
apparently there's some theories and I'm
going<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.840> link<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:28.240> which<00:01:28.690> is<00:01:28.869> actually<00:01:29.050> off

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
going to link this which is actually off

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.490 
going to link this which is actually off
of<00:01:29.709> Reddit<00:01:30.429> who<00:01:31.360> found<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.780> out<00:01:31.990> I'm<00:01:32.289> going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
of Reddit who found this out I'm going

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.719 
of Reddit who found this out I'm going
to<00:01:32.560> link<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.039> description<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.640> you

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
to link that in the description so you

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.600 
to link that in the description so you
guys<00:01:33.850> can<00:01:34.030> check<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.330> out<00:01:34.450> but<00:01:35.110> basically<00:01:35.610> what

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
guys can check it out but basically what

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.160 
guys can check it out but basically what
is<00:01:36.729> going<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.910> do<00:01:37.119> is<00:01:37.390> it's<00:01:37.420> going<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.869> make<00:01:38.050> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
is going to do is it's going to make the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.199 
is going to do is it's going to make the
multiplayer<00:01:38.649> system<00:01:39.100> much<00:01:39.700> more<00:01:39.940> functional

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
multiplayer system much more functional

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.910 
multiplayer system much more functional
that's<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> bottom<00:01:41.080> line<00:01:41.110> that's<00:01:41.649> what<00:01:41.860> you

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
that's the bottom line that's what you

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.010 
that's the bottom line that's what you
can<00:01:42.039> take<00:01:42.220> away<00:01:42.399> from<00:01:42.429> this<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.509> also<00:01:43.690> goes

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
can take away from this and it also goes

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.719 
can take away from this and it also goes
on<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.200> talk<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.560> little<00:01:44.770> bit<00:01:44.950> about<00:01:45.130> possibly

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
on to talk a little bit about possibly

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:46.940 
on to talk a little bit about possibly
the<00:01:45.910> halo<00:01:46.119> master<00:01:46.390> chief<00:01:46.660> collection

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the halo master chief collection

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.270 
the halo master chief collection
actually<00:01:47.950> had<00:01:48.280> this<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.869> 343<00:01:50.830> was<00:01:51.069> doing

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
actually had this and 343 was doing

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.520 
actually had this and 343 was doing
everything<00:01:51.369> they<00:01:51.670> could<00:01:51.729> do<00:01:52.149> but<00:01:52.929> Microsoft

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
everything they could do but Microsoft

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.400 
everything they could do but Microsoft
didn't<00:01:54.280> have<00:01:54.459> their<00:01:54.849> server<00:01:55.300> their<00:01:55.810> sections

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
didn't have their server their sections

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.980 
didn't have their server their sections
up<00:01:56.709> this<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.399> up<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:57.970> basically<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.690> master

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
up this and up so basically the master

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.150 
up this and up so basically the master
chief<00:01:59.170> collection<00:01:59.200> was<00:01:59.649> going<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.830> be<00:01:59.890> running

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
chief collection was going to be running

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.460 
chief collection was going to be running
on<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.429> new<00:02:00.729> multiplayer<00:02:01.300> system<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:02.380> was

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
on this new multiplayer system that was

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.050 
on this new multiplayer system that was
going<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.649> be<00:02:02.740> highly<00:02:03.220> refined<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.880> things

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
going to be highly refined and things

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.600 
going to be highly refined and things
like<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.240> but<00:02:04.890> Microsoft<00:02:05.890> wasn't<00:02:06.340> exactly

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
like that but Microsoft wasn't exactly

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.510 
like that but Microsoft wasn't exactly
ready<00:02:07.119> for<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.099> it's<00:02:09.310> going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.459> be

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520
