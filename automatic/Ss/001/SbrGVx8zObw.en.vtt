workouts where this moon will occur and
I<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.860> you'll<00:00:53.100> find<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
be and I'm not going to say just testy

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.369 
be and I'm not going to say just testy
but<00:00:56.730> you'll<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.360> aware<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.579> things

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
but you'll be really aware of things

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.619

right<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.189> speak<00:01:29.340> hosting<00:01:30.110> planets

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
right now as we speak hosting planets

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.100 
right now as we speak hosting planets
three<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> four<00:01:32.640> planets<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.930> not

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
three of the four planets like to not

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
three of the four planets like to not
get<00:01:34.350> along<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> stir<00:01:35.280> things<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.759> or

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so we have a grand cross and cardinal

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
so we have a grand cross and cardinal
signs<00:01:40.920> where<00:01:41.189> action<00:01:41.610> has<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.970> taken<00:01:42.170> with

improving and perfecting or you know

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.530 
improving and perfecting or you know
getting<00:02:24.269> more<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.290> line<00:02:25.530> with<00:02:25.879> your<00:02:26.879> sensitive

wait for these eclipses to get there we

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.640 
wait for these eclipses to get there we

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
cardinal signs as we speak two of the

cardinal signs as we speak two of the

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.270 
planets are going backwards contrived
one<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.379> planets<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.859> are<00:03:13.920> in<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.129> car

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
one of the planets that are in the car

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.649 
one of the planets that are in the car
besides<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.730> backwards<00:03:15.180> will<00:03:15.269> be<00:03:15.389> of<00:03:15.480> two

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
besides going backwards will be of two

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.199 
besides going backwards will be of two
planets<00:03:15.870> right<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.409> go<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.400> retrograde<00:03:17.970> one

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
planets right now go on retrograde one

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.720 
planets right now go on retrograde one
is<00:03:18.359> mars-1<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.169> essential<00:03:19.949> I'm<00:03:20.099> sorry<00:03:20.459> satyr

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
is mars-1 is essential I'm sorry satyr

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.939 
is mars-1 is essential I'm sorry satyr
and<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:21.930> both<00:03:22.139> those<00:03:22.349> planets<00:03:22.739> going

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
and so with both those planets going

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.949 
and so with both those planets going
back<00:03:23.129> you're<00:03:23.579> going<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.849> see<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.269> strategies

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
back you're going to see the strategies

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.879 
back you're going to see the strategies
of<00:03:25.669> what<00:03:26.669> to<00:03:26.879> come<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.419> really<00:03:27.959> i'm<00:03:28.349> going<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
of what to come is really i'm going to

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.449 
of what to come is really i'm going to
emerge<00:03:29.359> now<00:03:30.530> because<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.650> means<00:03:31.919> so<00:03:32.040> close

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
emerge now because this means so close

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.430 
emerge now because this means so close
to<00:03:32.699> that<00:03:32.849> date<00:03:33.180> i<00:03:33.209> talked<00:03:33.720> about<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.199> past

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
to that date i talked about in the past

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.979 
to that date i talked about in the past
that<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.340> first<00:03:35.910> day<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.329> spring<00:03:36.449> from<00:03:36.870> the

that that first day of spring from the

that that first day of spring from the
northern<00:03:37.290> hemisphere<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:39.690> you're<00:03:39.900> very

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
sensitive to what's going on i guess i'm

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.610 
sensitive to what's going on i guess i'm
going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.680> encourage<00:03:44.099> all<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.620> pay

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
and so are the younger people but that's

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.110 
and so are the younger people but that's
why<00:04:27.180> they<00:04:27.360> tried<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.790> consumed<00:04:29.790> them<00:04:29.970> with

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
why they tried to so consumed them with

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.750 
why they tried to so consumed them with
logic<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.870> technology<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.730> know

logic and technology and and you know

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.400 
logic and technology and and you know
these<00:04:33.150> things<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.540> get<00:04:33.750> keep<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.200> mind

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
these things that get keep the mind

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.110 
these things that get keep the mind
running<00:04:34.920> running<00:04:35.130> running<00:04:35.220> where<00:04:36.030> they

as far as evolution but we need what we
need<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.930> do<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.370> help<00:05:05.370> them<00:05:05.550> along<00:05:05.670> and

feeling and understanding who they were
what<00:05:07.740> they<00:05:07.800> were<00:05:07.920> i<00:05:08.040> hope<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.460> do<00:05:08.610> that<00:05:08.850> for

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
what they were i hope you do that for

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.240 
what they were i hope you do that for
your<00:05:09.600> surroundings<00:05:10.170> and<00:05:10.320> then<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.830> course<00:05:11.130> you

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
your surroundings and then of course you

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.000 
your surroundings and then of course you
must<00:05:11.580> do<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:11.970> for<00:05:12.180> yourself<00:05:12.560> we<00:05:13.560> still<00:05:13.830> got

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
must do that for yourself we still got

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.780 
must do that for yourself we still got
your<00:05:14.610> in<00:05:14.730> a<00:05:14.820> square<00:05:15.090> pluto<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:16.110> still<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:17.010> to

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
your in a square pluto you still have to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.580 
your in a square pluto you still have to
pedure<00:05:18.030> opposite<00:05:18.570> pluto<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.050> we<00:05:19.170> still<00:05:19.410> have

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
pedure opposite pluto and we still have

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.260 
pedure opposite pluto and we still have
these<00:05:19.980> are<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.250> cardinal<00:05:20.640> signs<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.210> the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
these are the cardinal signs and the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.390 
these are the cardinal signs and the
planets<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.720> are<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.860> cardinal<00:05:23.220> signs

planets that are in the cardinal signs

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.670 
planets that are in the cardinal signs
we<00:05:23.580> still<00:05:23.760> have<00:05:23.880> mars<00:05:24.180> in<00:05:24.500> libra<00:05:25.500> and

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
we still have mars in libra and

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.220 
we still have mars in libra and
marshalls<00:05:26.070> going<00:05:26.250> back<00:05:26.430> retrograde<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:27.270> Mars

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
marshalls going back retrograde so Mars

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.340 
marshalls going back retrograde so Mars
are<00:05:28.350> going<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.560> come<00:05:28.740> back<00:05:28.890> close<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:30.350> directly

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
are going to come back close to directly

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.540 
are going to come back close to directly
opposing<00:05:32.010> Uranus<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.210> directly<00:05:33.570> squaring

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
opposing Uranus and directly squaring

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.230 
opposing Uranus and directly squaring
Pluto<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:35.820> directly<00:05:36.690> squaring<00:05:37.320> also<00:05:38.240> Jupiter

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
Pluto and directly squaring also Jupiter

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.560 
Pluto and directly squaring also Jupiter
Jupiter<00:05:39.750> expands<00:05:40.200> anything<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.740> touches<00:05:41.570> to

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
Jupiter expands anything it touches to

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.820 
Jupiter expands anything it touches to
the<00:05:42.630> destroys<00:05:43.220> Uranus<00:05:44.220> changes<00:05:45.830> chaotically

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
the destroys Uranus changes chaotically

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.970 
the destroys Uranus changes chaotically
and<00:05:47.100> then<00:05:47.520> mark<00:05:47.760> says<00:05:48.230> with<00:05:49.230> force<00:05:49.500> I'm<00:05:49.800> going

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
and then mark says with force I'm going

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.890 
and then mark says with force I'm going
forward<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:51.030> can<00:05:51.180> do<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.330> math<00:05:51.630> on<00:05:51.840> that

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
forward so you can do the math on that

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.140 
forward so you can do the math on that
if<00:05:52.620> all<00:05:52.860> four<00:05:53.040> cardinal<00:05:53.550> signs<00:05:53.760> are<00:05:53.910> involved

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
if all four cardinal signs are involved

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.510 
if all four cardinal signs are involved
something<00:05:54.450> has<00:05:54.810> to<00:05:54.960> be<00:05:55.080> done<00:05:55.110> so<00:05:55.590> yes<00:05:56.100> this<00:05:56.280> is

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
something has to be done so yes this is

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.670 
something has to be done so yes this is
the<00:05:56.550> war<00:05:56.880> they<00:05:57.390> waited<00:05:57.660> for<00:05:57.840> this<00:05:58.080> time<00:05:58.380> that
