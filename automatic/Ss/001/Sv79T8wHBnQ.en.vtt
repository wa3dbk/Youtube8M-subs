own little battery inside them they
charge<00:01:25.170> via<00:01:25.439> USB<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> they<00:01:29.700> hook<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.390> by<00:01:30.630> USB<00:01:31.020> or

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.450 

the<00:01:34.650> normal<00:01:34.979> audio<00:01:35.159> jack<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the normal audio jack so there it is

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.859 
the normal audio jack so there it is
there<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:40.280> options<00:01:43.100> pretty<00:01:44.100> long<00:01:44.310> cable

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.859 

it's<00:01:47.869> probably<00:01:48.700> nearly<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.789> meter<00:01:50.030> long<00:01:51.070> and

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
it's probably nearly a meter long and

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.870 
it's probably nearly a meter long and
then<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.530> way<00:01:54.679> it<00:01:54.799> hooks<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:55.310> speakers

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
then the way it hooks up to the speakers

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.260 
then the way it hooks up to the speakers
is<00:01:56.210> it's<00:01:56.929> actually<00:01:57.229> got<00:01:57.820> left<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.060> right

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
is it's actually got left and right

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.620 
is it's actually got left and right
written<00:01:59.780> on<00:01:59.899> these<00:02:00.110> two<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.119> can<00:02:02.390> see
