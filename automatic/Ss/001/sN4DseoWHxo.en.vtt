00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
around and quickly know turn back which

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.859 
around and quickly know turn back which
is<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.369> dangerous<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.150> whereas

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
is a little bit dangerous and whereas

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
is a little bit dangerous and whereas
now<00:01:25.049> there's<00:01:25.530> absolutely<00:01:25.799> no<00:01:26.340> problem<00:01:26.580> things

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
now there's absolutely no problem things

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
now there's absolutely no problem things
like<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> park<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.189> been<00:01:29.850> a
