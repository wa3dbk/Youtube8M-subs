00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.819
there are two main types of sleep studies: there's
overnight

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.709
some of these four-week have you
watched

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.449
through the course of the night to see what you
do during your sleep

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.640
measure your brain wave activity your
heart rhythms your oxygen leg movements

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.560
and uh... the second type of study is very
similar but if you are found to have a

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.539
sleep disorder the second type of sleep study

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.119
is used to treat that disorder monitor you
during the night

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.210
to verify your treatment works and what
specific treatment you should have

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.520

uh... the glass doors you'll check in with

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.630

once it the time approaches toward your
bedtime they'll turn out the lights and let

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270

course of the night most of the beds will

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.940
