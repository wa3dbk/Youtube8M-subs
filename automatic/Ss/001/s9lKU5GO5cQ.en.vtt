00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290 
holder right here the quality on it it's
okay<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> mean<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.760> thin<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
okay I mean it's a little thin so I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
okay I mean it's a little thin so I
think<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.719> ID<00:00:51.870> may<00:00:52.170> fall<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.129> you're

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
think your ID may fall out if you're

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
think your ID may fall out if you're
using<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.539> ID<00:00:54.690> holder<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> suggest

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
using it for an ID holder so I suggest

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130
