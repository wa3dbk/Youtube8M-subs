something real smooth let's keep the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.150 
something real smooth let's keep the
texture<00:00:06.390> as<00:00:06.600> well<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.589> first<00:00:07.770> things<00:00:08.069> first

let's duplicate this layer we'll call
this<00:00:11.280> one<00:00:11.340> base<00:00:11.960> and<00:00:13.280> then<00:00:14.280> we'll<00:00:14.460> call

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
this one base and then we'll call

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:24.019 
this one base and then we'll call
another<00:00:15.660> other<00:00:16.109> layer<00:00:16.940> skin<00:00:18.560> color<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> with

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
can see that we remove the blemishes so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.420 
can see that we remove the blemishes so
this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.670> our<00:00:50.879> clean<00:00:51.210> skin<00:00:51.719> layer<00:00:52.430> let's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this is our clean skin layer let's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.090 
this is our clean skin layer let's
duplicate<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.300> layer<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.440> call<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.480> skin

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
duplicate this layer and call it skin

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
duplicate this layer and call it skin
texture<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> skin<00:01:01.469> texture<00:01:01.920> in

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
texture so we have the skin texture in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
texture so we have the skin texture in
the<00:01:02.370> skin<00:01:02.730> color<00:01:03.180> hide<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.170> layer<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.799> now

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the skin color hide this layer for now

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.080 
the skin color hide this layer for now
go<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.850> skin<00:01:06.240> color<00:01:07.490> go<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.049> filter<00:01:10.049> blur

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
go to your skin color go to filter blur

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
go to your skin color go to filter blur
and<00:01:12.140> Gaussian<00:01:13.140> blur<00:01:14.360> blur<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.990> five<00:01:16.860> should

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and Gaussian blur blur it to five should

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.070 
and Gaussian blur blur it to five should
be<00:01:17.189> fine<00:01:18.170> now<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.530> back<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.950> skin<00:01:20.430> texture

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
be fine now go back to your skin texture

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.120 
be fine now go back to your skin texture
you<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> filter<00:01:23.340> other<00:01:24.530> High<00:01:25.530> Pass

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you want to go to filter other High Pass

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.420 
you want to go to filter other High Pass
as<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> inverts<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.350> image<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
as you can see it inverts the image and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.660 
as you can see it inverts the image and
pushes<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.450> little<00:01:31.250> areas<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pushes out all these little areas of the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.170 
pushes out all these little areas of the
skin<00:01:33.590> 5.4<00:01:34.590> might<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.920> too<00:01:35.100> high<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.970> let's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
skin 5.4 might be too high we let's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.380 
skin 5.4 might be too high we let's
lower<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.840> down<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.380> something<00:01:37.770> around

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
lower this down to something around

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.319 
lower this down to something around
let's<00:01:39.390> say<00:01:39.570> four<00:01:40.110> should<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> let's<00:01:42.180> go

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
let's say four should do it so let's go

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
let's say four should do it so let's go
over<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.110> layer<00:01:43.170> options<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
over here in our layer options and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.080 
over here in our layer options and
instead<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.670> normal<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.280> linear<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.909> one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
instead of normal go to linear it's one

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.460 
instead of normal go to linear it's one
of<00:01:48.180> these<00:01:48.270> linear<00:01:48.770> linear<00:01:49.790> light<00:01:51.200> now<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
of these linear linear light now you can

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.550 
of these linear linear light now you can
see<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.740> has<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.159> skin<00:01:53.490> texture<00:01:54.320> we<00:01:55.320> want<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
