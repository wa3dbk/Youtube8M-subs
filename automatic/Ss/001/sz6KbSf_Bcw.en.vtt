00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hey, 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.560
 my name is Toby Richards 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.940
 and today we get started with high speed photography 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.500
 using Hähnel Captur. 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 The photo I want to take 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.660
 is from a fire eater 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.800
 at the moment that the fire mass is at its largest. 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.300
 The timing to make the right shot is very difficult, 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.420
 but by using the light sensor of the Captur 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.920
 we can automate the process 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 and let the camera relax at the right time. 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.620
 We use the Hähnel Captur Module Pro for this shoot 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 with a Captur receiver and transmitter mounted on the camera 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.220
 and two extra receivers 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.040
 each attached to a flash. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.940
 As soon as our fire eater starts 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 the Module Pro will be triggered by the flame 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 and after a set delay the camera will relax, 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 simultaneously with both flash units. 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.680
 We take pictures in an old metal factory in London 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.540
 with very little light. 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.920
 The fact that the Captur system works wirelessly 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.420
 makes everything a lot easier 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 and much safer. 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 The Captur system is very versatile 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.400
 and can also be used to trigger multiple studio flash units. 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.460
 With a range of 100 meters, it is also a fantastic system for outdoors. 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 The Captur transmitter can easily be slid into the camera's hot shoe 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.120
 and the supplied cable connects the receiver with the camera remote control. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.300
 Synchronizing the transmitter and the flash receivers 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.500
 and then from the Module Pro with the camera receiver 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.660
 only takes a few seconds. 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.920
 Using multiple flash units is very simple: 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.740
 this only requires an extra receiver per flash unit. 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 A brief instruction 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 a few test shots 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440
 and then I activate the Module Pro 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.040
 to check whether it is being triggered by the flame. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.480
 I lower the sensitivity of the Module Pro for this shoot 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.540
 so that I am sure that it is only triggered by the mass of fire 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.000
 and not by the burning torch. 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.420
 We are ready. 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.340
 While our fire eaters are getting ready, 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 I set a small delay on the system. 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.440
 The photo is good, 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.820
 but I have not set enough delay on the Captur, 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.340
 so I do a little adjustment, 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100
 put in another fire eater and try again. 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.100
 I have now set the delay too long and the shot is too late 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.960
 so I choose the middle way and reduce the delay on the Module Pro slightly again. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 Another short instruction and I am ready. 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.480
