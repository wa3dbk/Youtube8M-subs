initially by three sections I'm going to

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.300 
initially by three sections I'm going to
have<00:01:07.570> one<00:01:07.810> section<00:01:08.230> on<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.380> list<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.890> then

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
of important because whenever I'm finger

easier for me if I compute my head all
the<00:01:36.460> way<00:01:36.820> over<00:01:37.330> because<00:01:37.900> sometimes<00:01:38.260> you<00:01:38.380> can

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
the way over because sometimes you can

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.230 
the way over because sometimes you can
think<00:01:38.800> your<00:01:38.950> hair<00:01:39.160> is<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.310> tangle<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.030> then

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
think your hair is a tangle and then

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.020 
think your hair is a tangle and then
it's<00:01:40.660> really<00:01:40.960> still<00:01:41.259> tangled<00:01:41.470> at<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.890> top<00:01:42.100> so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
it's really still tangled at the top so

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.730 
it's really still tangled at the top so
I'm<00:01:43.119> just<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.660> wrap<00:01:43.869> that<00:01:44.110> section<00:01:44.560> back

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.590 
I'm just going to wrap that section back
up<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.250> let<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.520> conditioner<00:01:46.060> sit<00:01:46.300> for<00:01:46.570> a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
up and let the conditioner sit for a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.140 
up and let the conditioner sit for a
while<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.110> repeat<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.890> process<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.610> all<00:01:48.820> four

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
while and repeat the process in all four

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:19.140

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.450 
other week I would say so what I love
about<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:21.960> is<00:05:22.110> since<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.530> works<00:05:22.770> just<00:05:23.130> as<00:05:23.340> good

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
about it is since it works just as good

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.490 
about it is since it works just as good
as<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.729> Tresemme<00:05:24.180> naturals<00:05:24.210> if<00:05:24.870> I'm<00:05:25.080> out<00:05:25.289> of

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
as the Tresemme naturals if I'm out of

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.310 
as the Tresemme naturals if I'm out of
one<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.919> them<00:05:26.130> in<00:05:26.310> my<00:05:26.700> opinion<00:05:27.090> they<00:05:27.720> do<00:05:29.090> work

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
one of them in my opinion they do work

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.659 
one of them in my opinion they do work
interchangeably<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.440> if<00:05:31.710> I'm<00:05:31.860> out<00:05:32.039> of<00:05:32.070> one<00:05:32.370> I

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
interchangeably so if I'm out of one I

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.940 
interchangeably so if I'm out of one I
can<00:05:33.090> use<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.390> other<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.050> think<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.620> it

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
can use the other and I think that it

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.120 
can use the other and I think that it
you<00:05:35.760> know<00:05:35.910> will<00:05:36.150> work<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.450> my<00:05:36.570> hair<00:05:36.810> just<00:05:37.740> as<00:05:37.950> oh
