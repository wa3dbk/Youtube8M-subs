I<00:02:10.050> use<00:02:10.080> flightcheck<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
I use flightcheck it is because the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.630 
I use flightcheck it is because the
chance<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.270> dying
