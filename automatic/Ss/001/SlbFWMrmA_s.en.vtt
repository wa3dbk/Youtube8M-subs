 sun heredity and diet movements 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.560
 repetitive movements of muscles contribute to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.919
 the formation of lines and wrinkles on the face 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 in addition the development of 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.029
 irregularities of pigmentation or 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.400
 Acne scars can cause acne

 often performed on the neck face 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.860
 and hands the different types of peelings 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 chemicals can reduce the appearance of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.810
 facial wrinkles scars and pigmentation 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.210

 more gentle treatment of peeling 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.220
 chemical peels 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.680
 are performed using 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.470
 alpha hydroxy acids and in some cases 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.810
 alpha hydroxy acids 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.120
 hydroxy acids are acids that occur 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.120
 naturally and which include 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.250
 glycolic acid and lactic acid 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.250
 fruits while beta 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 hydroxy acids include salicylic acid 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.080
 you may be familiar with acid 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.760
 glycolic acid and with salicylic acid a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 not infrequently important. 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 ingredients of facial creams and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 astringent although the concentration of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.909
 may vary depending on the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.490
 treatment extension the acids used 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 to perform the superficial peels 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.229
 not as annoying as others

 chemical peels in reality low 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.110
 concentrations of alpha hydroxy acids are 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.760
 often mixed in facial creams 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 solutions that can be used as part of 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.990
 of daily facial care routine 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.659
 to maintain a youthful appearance with 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.670
 short period of inactivity the peelings 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.400
 are an effective method for 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.369
 treat fine lines abnormalities of 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.040
 acne and skin scars pigmentation 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.750
 constantly dry 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.930
 the screen is composed of two layers 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 known as the epidermis and dermis 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.179
 epidermis or outer layer of skin acts 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.090
 as the primary defense against skin 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.620
 environment and, consequently, these 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 layers are damaged 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.200
 the dermis the deeper layer of the skin is 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.720
 composed mainly of woven fabric 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.870
 connective tissue 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.720
 of the dermis and collagen fibers 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.349
 elastin forms a network that provides 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.750
 structure support and elasticity of the skin 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.239
 over time this fiber network will also 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.909
 decomposes what, in addition to other factors 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.260
 contributes to the formation of wrinkles and 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.260
 other changes in appearance 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.430
 during a superficial peeling a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.070
 solution is applied to the face at 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.290
 solution causes mild trauma or injury 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.870
 in the epidermis which is composed of five 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.210
 different layers similar to 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.160
 skin exfoliation to injury causes 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.440
 the damaged outer layers 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.750
 peal as part of the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.990
 healing the growth increase 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.840
 cell phone produces new lower layers 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.050
 and healthier that provide the face 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.150
 a lush, rejuvenated appearance 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.280
 it is important to realize that peelings 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 are not intended for use in 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.110
 treatment of deep wrinkles or skin 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.540
 significantly flaccid 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.180
 in these circumstances a facelift 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.950
 or injections of skin filling 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.580
 can produce more 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.190
 often referred to as 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.230
 peeling of the lunch hour in general the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.600
 superficial peels can last between 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.370
 15 and 30 minutes 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.130
 few weeks before your procedure 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.560
 your doctor may recommend the use of a 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.550
 product containing trans acid 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.590
 retinoic 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.780
 because it is believed that acid 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.540
 both retinoic prepare the layers 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.760
 of the skin for treatment has 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.100
 as it allows the chemical solution of the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.090
 peeling is evenly absorbed 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.520
 by the skin 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.460
 it may also be necessary to wash the 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.650
 face with special soap 24 hours 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.080
 prior to your procedure before 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.700
 beginning of your procedure to the areas of 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.410
 treatment will be cleaned 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.870
 typically using a product 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.850
 facial cleansing based on something 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.680
 although you may feel light 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.390
 burning or heating sensation 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.310
 during treatment 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.200
 most likely you will not feel 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.540
 no significant pain 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.930
 therefore for a superficial peeling in 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.330
 An anesthetic is not necessary. 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.250
 using a sponge a brush the doctor 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.320
 apply the chemical solution in 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.380
 individual over the entire face 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.780
 the solution will penetrate your skin 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.720
 about 15 minutes 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.400
 then it will be removed or neutralized 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.400
 with another substance 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.010
 in general superficial peels treat 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.050
 the epidermis is why the effects 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.020
 treatment are lower than 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.449
 other types of 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.389
 chemical peels 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.069
 used during a superficial peeling 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.639
 damages the outermost layers of the 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:10.190
 epidermis which causes it to peel in the 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.740
 healing process triggers the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.120
 growth that generates new 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.580
 layers of skin 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.699
 in addition the healing process 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.440
 also stimulates the production of collagen and 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.229
 elastin in the dermis 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.500
 as the damaged skin peels off 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:32.110
 the new skin revealed tango to the face a 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.110
 revitalized softer appearance 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.210
 immediately after the procedure you 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.700
 you may feel some redness and 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.200
 which are similar to 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.380
 sunburn 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.810
 as the healing occurs is 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.230
 you can see some faces or 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.820
 peeling of the skin most likely 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.760
 these symptoms have decreased in 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.490
 approximately seven days 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.740
 although bandages are not required 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.490
 as in any wound it is important 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.780
 keep the area wet and protected 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.540
 therefore your doctor may recommend 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.550
 that a protective ointment be applied 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.930
 on your face several days after the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.200
 treatment 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.310
 the new skin begins to appear in about 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.920
 one to two weeks as 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.930
 heals your skin will become more sensitive 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.600
 exposure to the sun 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.790
 therefore during healing it is 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.040
 extremely important to protect the skin 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.040
 against the rays uv ae uv b 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.540
 in general the results of a peeling 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.360
 are moderate in comparison to 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.390
 with more aggressive forms of treatment 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.940
 as a medium or deep peeling in the 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.220
 However, this also means that 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.530
 risks associated with the procedure 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.020
 are usually smaller 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.840
 your doctor may recommend repeated 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.330
 treatments at regular intervals 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.060
 for example some people receive 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.970
 weekly or monthly treatment until 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.370
 that the desired result is achieved 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.310
 it is important to realize that the appearance of 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.250
 your skin will continue to change and grow old 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:15.100
 after the superficial peeling treatment 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.080
 however the superficial peels are 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.700
 a fast and effective method for 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.700
