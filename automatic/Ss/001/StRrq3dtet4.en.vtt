00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.180
 all vehicles have 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.860
 active or passive safety elements and 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.910
 it's about that you know 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.630
 distinguish between one and other elements 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.839
 of active safety are those that 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.390
 act automatically or by the 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.579
 intervention of the driver is avoided 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.099
 directly that the 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.399
 accident and safety elements 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.070
 passive are those who do not avoid 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:36.130
 the accident does prevent that once 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.750
 produced injuries to people 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.260
 that occupy the interior of the vehicle 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 be of greater consideration the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.790
 active security elements 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.850
 main ways by which you avoid 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.470
 accidents occur are the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.530
 lighting for example the accelerator 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.260
 the brake 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.079
 the suspension the system 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.379
 damping of the vehicle with it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.449
 prevents the accident from occurring 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.630
 passive safety elements more 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.259
 important by which once 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.780
 produced the accident we get 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.049
 that the injuries are minor 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.259
 consideration as they are the belt of 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.869
 security the most important the eibar the 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.560
 headrest or in the case of 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.960
 motorcycle drivers the helmet that 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.630
 you know that there are some elements that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.940
 they fulfill the two functions that is to say by 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.420
 one part are security elements 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.580
 active because they prevent the occurrence of 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.610
 accident and on the other hand that same 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.789
 element can be considered of 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.280
 passive safety because it prevents 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.140
 injuries are of greater consideration os 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.940
 I give an example regarding this 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.520
 last I have commented 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.490
 the steering wheel is a safety element 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.950
 active because by manipulating it when acting 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.530
 on him we can change the trajectory 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.050
 of the vehicle and avoid the accident and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.960
 it is also a passive safety element 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.480
 because it is built with materials 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.140
 very absorbent to impact or for example 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.960
 well articulated in such a way that in 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.530
 a good frontal collision because it is chopped 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.910
 the address bar and prevents you from 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.910
 harm the driver of the vehicle
