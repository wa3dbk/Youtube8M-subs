00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.049
 welcome to sandrina bandera 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.190
 curator of the exhibition of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
 verres mag at the quirinale stables 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.880
 here is an important show because it comes 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.160
 told together with other painters there 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 in fact there are about 50 works by artists 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.789
 his contemporaries, here we are 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.689
 tell a little about how it was organized 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.830
 the exhibition the exhibition is born around 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:28.789
 to one of the greatest artists of the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:33.570
 art history but aims to 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:37.469
 present the historical and artistic context 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.260
 cultural of a country whose little art 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.500
 known in Italy and which has some 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.760
 features that the public perhaps a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 already identified bourgeois painting 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 certainly understood but not thoroughly familiar 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.170
 therefore the exhibition also proposes to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 leave an important trace in the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 public knowledge 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 calculating and also considering that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.760
 this specific topic of art 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.130
 almost no Dutch is studied at 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.030
 school is badly studied in 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.030
 university 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 the current world 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.580
 for a certain width of views for 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.470
 a whole series of ideologies that 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.759
 actually consider a lot 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.520
 important 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.580
 rejects the idea of ​​the masterpiece and this is 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.340
 right and right to prevent the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.770
 public had eight before him 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.920
 werner paintings to taste the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.140
 characteristics we wanted to impose 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:51.910
 this beautiful journey through 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 works that allow us to understand better 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.110
 the art of x men but illustrating one 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.390
 of the most fascinating pictorial schools 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.990
 of and more modern European art 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.700
 then the exhibition 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.550
 in lighting for mary it actually opens 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.550
 an important gash on a knife from 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.880
 mitolo and it is hoped that the public will come out 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.190
 with more knowledge with a greater one 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.290
 opening here the Dutch said she 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.840
 first at that time at least it is 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.019
 the others also dedicated themselves to 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.340
 this painting portraiture people 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.230
 simple that it wasn't particularly 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.790
 linked to a religion rather than a 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.260
 another in the netherlands the regions were 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.900
 accepted they had difficulties i 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.829
 Catholics had many difficulties but 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.500
 they could not be public then 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.609
 one year we have no commission at all 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.980
 of religious art , however, it is not 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.359
 an art before its ethics of a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.340
 his moral attention indeed 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:05.340
 the most interesting aspect of the exhibition 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 is how much there is of ethics of morality 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.760
 interest in women for society 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.860
 for the formation of the person I am the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.890
 same house as for merchandise from the inventory 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.260
 that we extended after the death of 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.690
 for goods we see that his works 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.790
 they are inserted in his house but 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.430
 interesting there are just like 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.660
 I said at the beginning it is a large exhibition 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.740
 values ​​that is beyond a realism that 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.200
 focuses on what you see is 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.900
 even and made hyper real through 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.140
 an optical instrument of which holland is 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.240
 was the country that spread 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.950
 first 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.750
 these instruments and I speak of 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.880
 dark room but beyond this 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.390
 ability to render representation 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.600
 details of the light 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.970
 the mm x differences for the millimeter 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.410
 of how light 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.820
 falls on the object on things on the sui 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.780
 paved and so on beyond 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.200
 this realism 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.950
 the exhibition is an exhibition of great ideals 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:23.230
 ethical if it comes out just loads I see the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:26.860
 bed by werner but also some loads 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.410
 of a teaching that today 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.680
 I think it's also very useful 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.590
 the woman has become the center 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.510
 of the order but also microcosm of a 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.470
 great and macrocosm that the state 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.980
 Dutch 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.200
 the house is the place of peace where the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.230
 family meets where they are educated 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.790
 children surrounded by the light that gives 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.180
 long for joy gives serenity 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.750
 people sing music together 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.790
 felt as a tool to get to 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.150
 flat to friendship to attach the 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.170
 people all this is governed by a culture 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.630
 that maybe you can learn by reading the 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:17.090
 catalog that actually circulated in 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.680
 holland poems treated with tendis 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.360
 they circulated just to exalt these 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.300
 these characteristics are great virtues 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.680
 my grandmother 's family is represented 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.270
 often who writes but we have 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.620
 actually a whole tradition 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.740
 literary of women writers of women 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.950
 booksellers and then and you go out 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.840
 even if we didn't have different levels 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.820
 I thank you very much thanks to Sandrina 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.750
 well decayed has been with us good 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.750
 I work at a big new one
