sharp<00:00:44.670> system<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> basically<00:00:46.010> as<00:00:47.010> soon

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
sharp system is that basically as soon

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
sharp system is that basically as soon
as<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> chain<00:00:47.640> goes<00:00:47.820> dull<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
as the chain goes dull all you have to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
as the chain goes dull all you have to
do<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> sharpen<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.190> having<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
do is sharpen it and it's like having a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.450 
do is sharpen it and it's like having a
brand-new<00:00:50.780> chain<00:00:51.780> again<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.890> perfect

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
brand-new chain again so it's perfect

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
brand-new chain again so it's perfect
cutting<00:00:53.730> every<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
cutting every time you use it and it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
cutting every time you use it and it
basically<00:00:55.469> keeps<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.579> no<00:00:56.850> matter

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
can get to the damaged areas very

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.490 
can get to the damaged areas very
quickly<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:06.119> find<00:01:06.570> where<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.930> cutting<00:01:07.170> near

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
quickly I find where I'm cutting near

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
quickly I find where I'm cutting near
roads<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.189> there's<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:08.909> kinds<00:01:09.180> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
roads and there's all kinds of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.179 
roads and there's all kinds of
conditions<00:01:09.450> were<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.710> chain<00:01:10.979> can

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
conditions were basically my chain can

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.640 
conditions were basically my chain can
contact<00:01:11.640> either<00:01:12.180> asphalt<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.110> rock<00:01:13.380> that

contact either asphalt or rock that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.179 
contact either asphalt or rock that
would<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> come<00:01:14.250> dull<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.240> quickly<00:01:16.189> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
would make it come dull very quickly so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
would make it come dull very quickly so
