leads to the generator if you're not

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.389 
leads to the generator if you're not
super<00:01:54.869> familiar<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> wiring<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.220> might

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
super familiar with the wiring you might

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.430 
super familiar with the wiring you might
want<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.640> mark<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:57.000> wires<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.170> remove

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
want to mark your wires as you remove

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.940
