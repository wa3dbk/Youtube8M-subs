for this case I'm going to be using your
red<00:00:20.640> dash<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> set<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
red dash so there is a set up so you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.599 
red dash so there is a set up so you
start<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.080> putting<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.529> red<00:00:25.710> back<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.340> this
