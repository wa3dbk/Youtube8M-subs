00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
um as you can see the cart is pretty

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.370 
um as you can see the cart is pretty
well<00:00:02.610> finished<00:00:03.030> one<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.780> things<00:00:03.990> I<00:00:04.140> wanted

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
well finished one of the things I wanted

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.720 
well finished one of the things I wanted
to<00:00:04.440> do<00:00:04.620> was<00:00:04.770> talk<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.310> centrifugal

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
to do was talk about the centrifugal

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.560 
to do was talk about the centrifugal
clutch<00:00:06.089> which<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.540> right<00:00:06.779> here<00:00:08.150> this<00:00:09.150> clutch

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
clutch which is right here this clutch

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.049 
clutch which is right here this clutch
operates<00:00:10.260> when<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.769> step<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.460> gas<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
operates when you step on the gas the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.299 
operates when you step on the gas the
engine<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:12.900> spins<00:00:13.650> spins<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.280> shaft

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
engine which spins spins the shaft

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.210 
engine which spins spins the shaft
inside<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:16.199> throws<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.590> series<00:00:17.190> of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
inside here and that throws a series of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.939 
inside here and that throws a series of
weights<00:00:17.670> outward<00:00:18.390> when<00:00:19.260> those<00:00:19.439> weights<00:00:19.740> are

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
weights outward when those weights are

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
weights outward when those weights are
thrown<00:00:20.250> outward<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:21.420> engages<00:00:21.900> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
thrown outward that engages this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.279 
thrown outward that engages this
drivetrain<00:00:23.390> one<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.570> problems<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.019> we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
drivetrain one of the problems that we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.679 
drivetrain one of the problems that we
had<00:00:25.500> when<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.189> clutch<00:00:26.430> was<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
had when we got the clutch was that it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.560 
had when we got the clutch was that it
was<00:00:28.050> -<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:29.010> would<00:00:29.189> lock<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.640> too<00:00:29.849> fast<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
was - it would lock up too fast and the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.590 
was - it would lock up too fast and the
engine<00:00:30.869> couldn't<00:00:31.199> couldn't<00:00:31.730> idle<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
engine couldn't couldn't idle so what I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.940 
engine couldn't couldn't idle so what I
want<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> want<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> spend<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:34.829> time

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
want to do is I want to spend some time

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.119 
want to do is I want to spend some time
and<00:00:35.399> talk<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:36.110> how<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.140> adjust<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.890> clutch

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and talk about how to adjust the clutch

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.880 
and talk about how to adjust the clutch
in<00:00:38.340> case<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.360> may<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> like

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
in case you get it you may get it like

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
in case you get it you may get it like
we<00:00:41.070> did<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.879> instantly<00:00:42.690> wants<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> lock

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we did or just instantly wants to lock

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590 
we did or just instantly wants to lock
up<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.160> lowest<00:00:44.520> speed<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
up at the lowest speed and then you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
up at the lowest speed and then you
can't<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.050> idle<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> should<00:00:47.550> work

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
can't have idle the way it should work

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.110 
can't have idle the way it should work
is<00:00:48.120> start<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> engine<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:50.219> idles<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.760> idols

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
is start the engine get idles and idols

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910 
is start the engine get idles and idols
and<00:00:51.239> idles<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> step<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and idles and then when you step on the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.279 
and idles and then when you step on the
gas

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
gas

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
gas
once<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.410> step<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> gas<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.940> should<00:00:57.660> take

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
once you step on the gas it should take

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840 
once you step on the gas it should take
off<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.469> shouldn't<00:00:58.829> engage<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> thing

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
off it shouldn't engage when the thing

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
off it shouldn't engage when the thing
is<00:01:00.000> idling<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.379> let's<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> first

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
is idling so let's do that the first

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
is idling so let's do that the first
thing<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.579> need<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.199> easiest<00:01:04.470> way<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
thing I need to do is the easiest way to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.980 
thing I need to do is the easiest way to
get<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> clutch<00:01:05.250> apart<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.900> gonna

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
get the clutch apart is I'm just gonna

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
get the clutch apart is I'm just gonna
pop<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> master<00:01:07.830> link<00:01:08.070> apart<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790

another tool and it's really well worth

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.199 
another tool and it's really well worth
it<00:02:52.050> might<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.380> fifteen<00:02:52.799> dollars<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.790> pair

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
it might be fifteen dollars for a pair

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.050 
it might be fifteen dollars for a pair
of<00:02:54.269> these<00:02:54.860> now<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> clutch<00:02:56.310> will<00:02:56.489> slide<00:02:56.820> off

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
of these now the clutch will slide off

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.820 
of these now the clutch will slide off
and<00:02:57.630> when<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.870> slides<00:02:58.110> off<00:02:58.320> we'll<00:02:58.500> be<00:02:58.590> able<00:02:58.680> to

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
and when it slides off we'll be able to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:09.050 
and when it slides off we'll be able to
see<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.190> construction<00:02:59.850> of<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:07.549> okay<00:03:08.549> here's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
see the construction of it okay here's

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.530 
see the construction of it okay here's
the<00:03:09.299> drum<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.799> drum<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.430> what<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
the drum and this drum is what the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.390 
the drum and this drum is what the
weights<00:03:13.489> act<00:03:14.489> upon<00:03:14.940> when<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.620> clutch<00:03:16.890> engages

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
weights act upon when the clutch engages

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.240 
weights act upon when the clutch engages
and<00:03:18.200> we<00:03:19.200> want<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.470> make<00:03:19.590> sure<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.070> is

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
and we want to make sure that this is

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.830 
and we want to make sure that this is
clean<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.670> dry<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.209> don't<00:03:21.360> want<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.570> we<00:03:21.810> don't

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
clean and dry we don't want it we don't

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.690 
clean and dry we don't want it we don't
want<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.170> oil<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.680> too<00:03:22.950> much<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.549> we

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
want to oil this too much because if we

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.400 
want to oil this too much because if we
do<00:03:23.850> well<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.209> too<00:03:24.360> much<00:03:24.510> will<00:03:24.750> get<00:03:24.870> oil<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.260> here

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
do well it too much will get oil in here

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.990 
do well it too much will get oil in here
and<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:26.070> what's<00:03:26.400> happened<00:03:26.850> you

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and I think that's what's happened you

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.580 
and I think that's what's happened you
see<00:03:27.269> we<00:03:27.420> have<00:03:27.570> grease<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:28.080> here<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
see we have grease in here so it's a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.060 
see we have grease in here so it's a
chance<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:29.040> me<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.160> clean<00:03:29.489> this<00:03:29.640> up<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:30.060> well

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
chance for me to clean this up as well

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.120 
chance for me to clean this up as well
now<00:03:32.070> what<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.610> disc<00:03:37.130> that

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
now what I have is I have the disc that

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.039 
now what I have is I have the disc that
holds<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:41.700> weights<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.480> I'm<00:03:42.690> gonna<00:03:42.780> take

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
holds the weights in and I'm gonna take

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.020 
holds the weights in and I'm gonna take
that<00:03:43.080> apart<00:03:43.560> also<00:03:43.799> with<00:03:44.220> my<00:03:44.370> retaining<00:03:44.880> ring

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
that apart also with my retaining ring

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.490 
that apart also with my retaining ring
pliers<00:03:45.060> which<00:03:45.690> I'm<00:03:45.840> really<00:03:45.989> going<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.260> have<00:03:46.320> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
pliers which I'm really going to have to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:56.330 
pliers which I'm really going to have to
have

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.040 

okay<00:03:57.340> now<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.640> whole<00:03:58.000> thing<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.270> coming<00:03:58.660> apart

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
okay now the whole thing is coming apart

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.660 
okay now the whole thing is coming apart
this<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.560> plate<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.040> keeps<00:04:00.310> everything

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
this is the plate that keeps everything

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.280 
this is the plate that keeps everything
down<00:04:01.120> here<00:04:01.510> are<00:04:02.260> my<00:04:02.440> weights<00:04:02.710> and<00:04:03.930> as<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.110> can

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
down here are my weights and as you can

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.050 
down here are my weights and as you can
see<00:04:05.530> they're<00:04:05.710> held<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.130> nice<00:04:06.310> ring<00:04:06.670> like

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
see they're held in a nice ring like

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.100 
see they're held in a nice ring like
that<00:04:07.330> by<00:04:07.990> a<00:04:08.020> spring<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.810> spring

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
that by a spring and it's the spring

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.100 
that by a spring and it's the spring
that<00:04:11.350> determines<00:04:11.920> when<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.520> engages<00:04:12.810> if<00:04:13.810> these

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
that determines when it engages if these

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.010 
that determines when it engages if these
were<00:04:14.320> held<00:04:14.590> very<00:04:14.860> loosely<00:04:15.370> together<00:04:17.040> then<00:04:19.020> the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
were held very loosely together then the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.440 
were held very loosely together then the
clutch<00:04:20.320> would<00:04:20.560> engage<00:04:20.920> immediately<00:04:21.450> if

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
clutch would engage immediately if

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.300 
clutch would engage immediately if
they're<00:04:22.660> held<00:04:22.870> too<00:04:23.140> tightly<00:04:23.440> by<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.800> spring

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
they're held too tightly by the spring

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.100 
they're held too tightly by the spring
then<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.610> might<00:04:24.760> have<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.060> rev<00:04:25.300> things<00:04:25.540> up<00:04:25.810> too

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
then you might have to rev things up too

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.340 
then you might have to rev things up too
much<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:26.560> too<00:04:26.710> fast<00:04:27.010> for<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.180> engage<00:04:28.540> what

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
much and too fast for it to engage what

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.740 
much and too fast for it to engage what
I'm<00:04:29.440> gonna<00:04:29.590> do<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:30.010> I'm<00:04:30.430> gonna<00:04:30.550> adjust<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.270> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna adjust it the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.060 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna adjust it the
way<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.930> do<00:04:32.140> that<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.800> take<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.160> apart<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:35.070> I

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
way to do that is to take it apart and I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.830 
way to do that is to take it apart and I
think<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.700> best<00:04:36.910> thing<00:04:37.120> for<00:04:37.150> me<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.480> do<00:04:37.690> with

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
think the best thing for me to do with

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.500 
think the best thing for me to do with
this<00:04:38.020> one<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.520> I'm<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.610> going<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.030> take<00:04:40.300> out

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
this one is I'm just going to take out

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:51.800 
this one is I'm just going to take out
one<00:04:41.160> clip<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:49.410> I've<00:04:50.580> essentially

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
one clip like so I've essentially

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.890 
one clip like so I've essentially
tightened<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> spring<00:04:53.290> up<00:04:53.500> by<00:04:54.480> about<00:04:55.480> one

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
tightened the spring up by about one

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.290 
tightened the spring up by about one
wand<00:04:58.320> which<00:04:59.320> is<00:04:59.500> about<00:05:00.000> all<00:05:01.000> about<00:05:01.270> a

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
wand which is about all about a

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.450 
wand which is about all about a
sixteenth<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.020> an<00:05:02.170> inch<00:05:02.290> increase<00:05:02.800> in<00:05:02.980> tension

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
sixteenth of an inch increase in tension

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.190 
sixteenth of an inch increase in tension
there<00:05:03.970> now<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.360> got<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.660> put<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:04.960> back

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
there now I got to put this back

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.660 
there now I got to put this back
together

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.690 

now<00:05:13.670> once<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.090> get<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.420> close<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:16.280> spring

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
now once I get this close the spring

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.600 
now once I get this close the spring
should<00:05:17.180> act<00:05:17.540> to<00:05:18.410> hold<00:05:18.650> them<00:05:18.860> all<00:05:18.980> together<00:05:19.160> and

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
should act to hold them all together and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.580 
should act to hold them all together and
it<00:05:19.760> has<00:05:19.970> now<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.390> tricky<00:05:20.960> part<00:05:21.230> here<00:05:21.320> is

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
it has now the tricky part here is

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.950 
it has now the tricky part here is
putting<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:22.070> back<00:05:22.280> together<00:05:22.520> or<00:05:23.240> now<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.660> have

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
putting this back together or now I have

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.830 
putting this back together or now I have
my<00:05:24.170> unit<00:05:24.590> with<00:05:24.920> my<00:05:25.130> spring<00:05:25.610> you'll<00:05:26.420> notice

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
my unit with my spring you'll notice

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.960 
my unit with my spring you'll notice
there<00:05:27.050> are<00:05:27.080> notches<00:05:27.680> here<00:05:28.040> these<00:05:28.550> notches

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
there are notches here these notches

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.120 
there are notches here these notches
have<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:30.140> fit<00:05:31.150> on<00:05:32.150> either<00:05:33.050> side<00:05:33.440> of<00:05:33.470> these<00:05:33.710> tabs

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
have to fit on either side of these tabs

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.700 
have to fit on either side of these tabs
and<00:05:34.460> this<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.760> how<00:05:34.880> it's<00:05:35.090> driven<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:36.290> engine

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
and this is how it's driven the engine

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.150 
and this is how it's driven the engine
drives<00:05:37.070> this<00:05:37.400> plate<00:05:37.930> which<00:05:38.930> drives<00:05:39.410> these

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
drives this plate which drives these

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.260 
drives this plate which drives these
weights<00:05:40.610> which<00:05:41.540> expand<00:05:42.490> when<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.580> RPMs<00:05:44.060> are

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
weights which expand when the RPMs are

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.050 
weights which expand when the RPMs are
reached<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:44.660> then<00:05:45.140> they<00:05:45.290> fly<00:05:46.280> outward<00:05:46.730> engage

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
reached and then they fly outward engage

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.910 
reached and then they fly outward engage
the<00:05:47.330> inside<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:47.870> this<00:05:47.960> drum<00:05:48.230> I<00:05:48.380> wanted<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.740> show

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
the inside of this drum I wanted to show

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.430 
the inside of this drum I wanted to show
you<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.160> inside<00:05:49.520> of<00:05:49.550> this<00:05:49.730> drum<00:05:50.030> I<00:05:50.410> had<00:05:51.410> a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
you the inside of this drum I had a

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.530 
you the inside of this drum I had a
little<00:05:51.680> oil<00:05:51.950> in<00:05:52.250> here<00:05:52.490> too<00:05:52.850> much<00:05:53.030> oil<00:05:53.270> as<00:05:53.510> a

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
little oil in here too much oil as a

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.420 
little oil in here too much oil as a
matter<00:05:53.780> of<00:05:53.870> fact<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.500> want<00:05:54.920> to<00:05:55.010> keep<00:05:55.190> this

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
matter of fact I want to keep this

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.570 
matter of fact I want to keep this
surface<00:05:55.910> clean<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.570> dry<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.080> oil<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:58.160> problem

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
surface clean and dry of oil the problem

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.180 
surface clean and dry of oil the problem
is<00:05:58.790> you'll<00:05:59.360> notice<00:05:59.570> inside<00:06:00.170> is<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.650> sintered

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
is you'll notice inside is a sintered

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.830 
is you'll notice inside is a sintered
bronze<00:06:01.550> bearing<00:06:02.180> it's<00:06:02.330> an<00:06:02.450> oil<00:06:02.660> impregnated

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
bronze bearing it's an oil impregnated

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.130 
bronze bearing it's an oil impregnated
bronze<00:06:03.620> bearing<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.210> really<00:06:05.570> has<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:05.930> be

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
bronze bearing and that really has to be

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.280 
bronze bearing and that really has to be
kept<00:06:06.500> relatively<00:06:07.460> lubricated<00:06:08.390> so<00:06:09.020> what<00:06:09.200> you

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
kept relatively lubricated so what you

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.710 
kept relatively lubricated so what you
want<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.620> do<00:06:09.800> when<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.520> clutch<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:10.940> on<00:06:11.210> the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
want to do when the clutch is on the

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.390 
want to do when the clutch is on the
engine<00:06:13.270> as<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:15.050> would<00:06:15.230> be<00:06:15.380> let's<00:06:15.650> say<00:06:15.860> now<00:06:16.070> I

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
engine as it would be let's say now I

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.780 
engine as it would be let's say now I
can<00:06:16.790> get<00:06:16.940> back<00:06:17.120> on<00:06:17.920> every<00:06:18.920> so<00:06:19.130> often<00:06:19.340> you<00:06:19.610> want

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
can get back on every so often you want

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.000 
can get back on every so often you want
to<00:06:19.880> put<00:06:20.000> a<00:06:20.030> drop<00:06:20.330> of<00:06:20.390> oil<00:06:20.780> here<00:06:21.110> say<00:06:21.380> 10w30

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
to put a drop of oil here say 10w30

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.490 
to put a drop of oil here say 10w30
motor<00:06:22.550> oil<00:06:22.820> but<00:06:23.690> you<00:06:23.750> don't<00:06:23.900> want<00:06:24.020> to<00:06:24.080> put<00:06:24.320> too

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
motor oil but you don't want to put too

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.500 
motor oil but you don't want to put too
much<00:06:24.530> because<00:06:24.710> if<00:06:25.130> you<00:06:25.220> put<00:06:25.430> too<00:06:25.580> much<00:06:25.610> it'll

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
much because if you put too much it'll

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.510 
much because if you put too much it'll
ease<00:06:26.870> to<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.200> inside<00:06:27.770> here<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.130> it'll<00:06:28.400> get

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
ease to the inside here and it'll get

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.550 
ease to the inside here and it'll get
slung<00:06:28.850> out<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.660> it'll<00:06:29.840> hit<00:06:29.960> this<00:06:30.140> bearing

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
slung out and it'll hit this bearing

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.150 
slung out and it'll hit this bearing
surface<00:06:31.010> or<00:06:31.280> the<00:06:32.050> the<00:06:33.050> friction<00:06:33.500> surface<00:06:33.950> and

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
surface or the the friction surface and

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.680 
surface or the the friction surface and
that's<00:06:34.220> kind<00:06:34.580> of<00:06:34.610> what<00:06:34.790> happened<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.270> overruled

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
that's kind of what happened I overruled

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.530 
that's kind of what happened I overruled
it<00:06:36.110> but<00:06:36.890> now<00:06:37.010> I've<00:06:37.190> cleaned<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.730> and<00:06:37.940> the

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
it but now I've cleaned it and the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.420 
it but now I've cleaned it and the
outsides<00:06:38.990> of<00:06:39.140> these<00:06:39.350> look<00:06:39.590> pretty<00:06:39.740> clean<00:06:40.100> too

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
outsides of these look pretty clean too

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.140 
outsides of these look pretty clean too
so<00:06:41.030> now<00:06:41.240> I'm<00:06:41.360> gonna<00:06:41.480> put<00:06:41.720> it<00:06:41.810> back<00:06:41.960> together
