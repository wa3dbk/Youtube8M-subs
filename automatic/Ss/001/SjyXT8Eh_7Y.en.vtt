00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.320
 I prepare a quantity of color 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.109
 sufficient depending on the surface 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 that we must paint in this case 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.400
 I mix the blues and the cerulean together with the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.610
 green so as to create a range of 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.440
 shades suitable for representing water 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.100
 but I also use red to modulate the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.100
 tones of purple 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.280
 then began to spread the color 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.719
 and try to change 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.180
 uphill so that while the sheet and 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.370
 wet the colors blend together 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.370
 evenly without leaving halos 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.659
 first use of cerulean then blue then lo 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.569
 drain with green 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.170
 moreover also some quick brushstrokes e 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:14.810
 rather random this is because yes 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.789
 create a more natural effect 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.200
 we don't want to put the spots in 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.329
 row behind each other otherwise 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.329
 would be very stiff and fake 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.219
 and work faster or the 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.960
 color we just spent yes 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.140
 dry and the next one then creates 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.490
 of the ugly spots 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.670
 substantially from the brushstrokes a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.880
 s shape so to speak flattened e 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.469
 then he blurred them to the edges to then join them 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.110
 to the other brushstrokes always in the shape of 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.360
 s 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.730
 this is just a test then feel 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 free to experiment to make mistakes 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.330
 also I for example here has blurred 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.970
 water at various points to see if there is 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.000
 I liked it 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.310
 but then I changed my mind he added 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.910
 touches of purple here and there purple 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.600
 almost almost pomace very hot 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:12.440
 then to balance I added a 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.910
 violet a little colder here and there 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.910
 so in this way 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.770
 and this is the overall effect 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.240
 if there are two points to be retouched yes 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.520
 can he 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.860
 do very well for example here I am not 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.110
 liked too faded and to some 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.570
 point decided to step up again 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.870
 the green by adding another pair of 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.870
 speckles 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.580
 this is as always 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.020
 so close they look like so many spots 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.020
 but then the effect from far away cute 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.940
 if instead you want to get more light 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.069
 warm just take a lot of yellow 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.010
 clear in my case a lemon yellow 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.939
 and with the criminal lawyer a veil is enough 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.939
 on the sheet 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.650
 in this way 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.060
 if he has put too much too much into it 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.790
 points is not a problem just dab 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.510
 with a little bit of paper 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.120
 then brush the brush again 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.469
 the same one more homogeneous and once 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.689
 dry the same is repeated 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.459
 first operation 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.620
 in this case I was working a lot 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.659
 in the small one therefore as you can see in 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.030
 punch the brush exactly as it was 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.620
 a pen is written just the part 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.620
 pointed brush 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.730
 then in certain places with 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.220
 vanish 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.950
 also for 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.560
 a test so I don't know exactly 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.400
 what i want i am experiencing 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.349
 trying 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.310
 and also here as in the other 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.230
 I intensify it with a bit of purple that 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.610
 to give more obscure points 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.030
 that also give a 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.600
 in some sense a bit of volume 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.800
 depth 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.800
 and this is the result 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.239
 this is the one with the warmest light 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.060
 where the veil of yellow is to be used 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.060
 while this is the coldest one
