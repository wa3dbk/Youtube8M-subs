00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
December 14 2009 and the model in the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.709 
December 14 2009 and the model in the
calendar<00:00:10.530> today<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.460> called<00:00:12.240> pass<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.559> note<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
calendar today is called pass a note and

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.120 
calendar today is called pass a note and
it's<00:00:15.719> basically<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:17.630> folding<00:00:18.630> technique<00:00:19.170> if

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
it's basically a folding technique if

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.859 
it's basically a folding technique if
you<00:00:20.430> were<00:00:20.609> had<00:00:21.090> written<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> note<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you were had written a note and you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.560 
you were had written a note and you
wanted<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.830> fold<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.609> secure<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
wanted to to fold it up and secure it so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
wanted to to fold it up and secure it so
rather<00:00:25.289> than<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> piece<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> origami<00:00:26.519> paper

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
rather than a piece of origami paper

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.820 
rather than a piece of origami paper
this<00:00:27.359> model<00:00:28.160> uses<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.340> piece<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.000> printer<00:00:30.779> paper

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
this model uses a piece of printer paper

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.190 
this model uses a piece of printer paper
so<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:32.160> you're<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.550> prepared<00:00:32.750> with<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> piece

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so if you're not prepared with a piece

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.130 
so if you're not prepared with a piece
of<00:00:34.489> printer<00:00:35.489> paper<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.940> ahead<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.540> find

then fold opposite corners to that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.980 
then fold opposite corners to that
center<00:01:13.350> line<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:16.850> like<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.479> then

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
center line so down like that and then

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
center line so down like that and then
the<00:01:19.200> opposite<00:01:19.680> corner<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the opposite corner from that one up to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.399 
the opposite corner from that one up to
the<00:01:21.869> center<00:01:22.259> line<00:01:24.950> like<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.479> then<00:01:27.479> fold

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the center line like that then fold

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.660 
the center line like that then fold
these<00:01:29.130> edges<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:33.030> edge<00:01:33.530> there<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
these edges here to this edge there so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.149 
these edges here to this edge there so
you're<00:01:35.850> folding<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.840> till<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
touches this opposing edge like that and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.039 
touches this opposing edge like that and
then<00:01:44.610> down<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:44.850> again<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.540> folding<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
then down here again you're folding this

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.940 
then down here again you're folding this
edge<00:01:46.290> over<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:48.210> meet<00:01:48.420> come<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> meet<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.170> one

like<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.840> know<00:01:55.899> just<00:01:56.640> rotate<00:01:57.640> your

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
like that you know just rotate your

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.779 
like that you know just rotate your
piece<00:01:58.060> around<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.740> it's<00:01:59.890> sitting<00:02:00.220> on<00:02:00.340> its<00:02:00.520> side

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
piece around so it's sitting on its side

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.779 
piece around so it's sitting on its side
and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.470> last<00:02:02.860> two<00:02:03.280> little<00:02:03.549> things<00:02:03.670> that

and<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.670> more<00:03:06.209> complicated<00:03:06.599> it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
and it is a little more complicated it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.270 
and it is a little more complicated it
uses<00:03:07.410> two<00:03:08.130> sheets<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.849> origami<00:03:09.630> paper<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.530> you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
uses two sheets of origami paper and you

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.160 
uses two sheets of origami paper and you
also<00:03:11.459> need<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.880> way<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.239> secure<00:03:12.810> them<00:03:12.989> together

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
also need a way to secure them together

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.530 
also need a way to secure them together
so<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.739> little<00:03:13.920> glue<00:03:14.280> or<00:03:14.700> double-faced<00:03:15.330> tape

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
so a little glue or double-faced tape

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.949 
so a little glue or double-faced tape
something<00:03:16.049> like<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.590> hand<00:03:17.130> will<00:03:17.959> help

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
something like that on hand will help

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.190 
something like that on hand will help

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
you be prepared so maybe back here then

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.259 
you be prepared so maybe back here then
and<00:03:22.590> we'll<00:03:22.830> work<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.190> another<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.970> star

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
and we'll work on another kind of a star

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.569 
and we'll work on another kind of a star
in<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.019> meantime<00:03:25.260> enjoy<00:03:25.799> your<00:03:26.220> day<00:03:26.430> take<00:03:27.330> care
