00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
manufacturing environment now I'll go

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.680 
manufacturing environment now I'll go
back<00:05:04.830> down<00:05:05.280> into<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.699> PowerPoint<00:05:06.180> show<00:05:06.419> mode

picture with none of these red frames

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.010 
picture with none of these red frames
but<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:11.910> as<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.030> class<00:05:12.449> gives<00:05:12.840> me

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
but that as the class gives me

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.650 
but that as the class gives me
suggestions<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.979> things<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:15.120> they<00:05:15.240> find<00:05:15.539> to

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
suggestions of things that they find to

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.140 
suggestions of things that they find to
be<00:05:15.780> an<00:05:15.870> issue<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:16.320> can<00:05:16.949> slowly<00:05:17.370> click<00:05:17.849> on<00:05:18.030> each

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
be an issue I can slowly click on each

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.510 
be an issue I can slowly click on each
one<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.419> those<00:05:18.660> areas<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.349> those<00:05:20.099> red<00:05:20.310> boxes

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
one of those areas and those red boxes

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520 
one of those areas and those red boxes
will<00:05:20.910> appear<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:21.930> is<00:05:22.050> again<00:05:22.229> a<00:05:22.259> really

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.680 
will appear and this is again a really
great<00:05:22.830> tool<00:05:23.130> just<00:05:23.849> to<00:05:23.940> create<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.300> little<00:05:24.389> bit

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
great tool just to create a little bit

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.060 
great tool just to create a little bit
more<00:05:24.870> back<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.110> forth<00:05:25.380> during<00:05:25.889> the

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
more back and forth during the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.710 
more back and forth during the
presentation<00:05:26.729> so<00:05:26.910> you're<00:05:27.060> not<00:05:27.150> just<00:05:27.389> sitting

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
presentation so you're not just sitting

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.960 
presentation so you're not just sitting
there<00:05:27.750> with<00:05:28.470> slides<00:05:29.009> and<00:05:29.340> slides<00:05:29.460> of
