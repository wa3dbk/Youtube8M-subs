studio stage mark 2 we've set that with
the<00:00:53.550> gain<00:00:53.760> fairly<00:00:54.210> flat<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> master<00:00:55.050> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the gain fairly flat so the master in

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
the game or at 12 o'clock reverb is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
the game or at 12 o'clock reverb is
practically<00:01:00.270> off<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:02.340> e<00:01:02.370> key<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
practically off like one the e key is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
practically off like one the e key is
set<00:01:03.149> fairly<00:01:03.449> high<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> bring<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> pedal<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
set fairly high to bring out the pedal a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
set fairly high to bring out the pedal a
bit<00:01:05.339> more<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.790> we've<00:01:05.909> put<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> middle<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.659> 3

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bit more so we've put the middle up at 3

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.560 
bit more so we've put the middle up at 3
o'clock<00:01:06.930> troubles<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.830> 3<00:01:08.100> bases<00:01:08.970> around<00:01:09.090> 11

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
o'clock troubles at 3 bases around 11

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920 
o'clock troubles at 3 bases around 11
o'clock

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.940 

you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.709 

okay<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> pet<00:01:20.520> box<00:01:20.789> we've<00:01:21.149> set<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
okay now with the pet box we've set the

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.050 
okay now with the pet box we've set the
the<00:01:22.679> gain<00:01:22.890> level<00:01:22.920> fairly<00:01:23.579> low<00:01:23.819> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the gain level fairly low it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:38.170 
the gain level fairly low it's
practically<00:01:24.539> off<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.109> halfway<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> level

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:02:11.240 

now

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.610 

okay<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.310> now<00:02:12.670> increase<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.090> gain<00:02:13.690> I'm<00:02:14.410> gonna

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
okay so now increase the gain I'm gonna

00:02:14.620 --> 00:03:05.980 
okay so now increase the gain I'm gonna
put<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:14.950> around<00:02:15.280> about<00:02:15.519> halfway

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.050 

and<00:03:06.650> now<00:03:06.980> we<00:03:07.040> have<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> gain<00:03:07.610> our<00:03:07.850> birth

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
and now we have the gain our birth

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:42.720 
and now we have the gain our birth
recorders

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.790 

yeah
