00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:14.450
 the said he saw so nothing is a poet 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.940
 thai 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.160
 then pick up the political match box 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:26.240
 It's nothing but the fact that the backpack side 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.620
 row little have my questions 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.679
 I understand that who will tell you the 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.510
 my story for centuries man 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.519
 he warmed his head to invent a 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.100
 easy way to make fire 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.350
 at first he rubbed rocks to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.989
 produce a spark that burned 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.429
 something easy to burn like a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.739
 dried leaf until in 1669 the chemist 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.510
 German called reminiscing made a 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.359
 very cool experience 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.289
 first the face filled 50 buckets of 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.319
 team 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.859
 then he waited for the liquid to create vernes 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:08.110
 then boiled all that pee that turned 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.110
 a white paste and mixed with the sand 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:24.590
 was discovered a new element 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:27.500
 chemical and phosphorus, and it is not true that 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.970
 and with this liquid glowed very dark 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:44.960
 the scientist gave the name of post 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:46.520
 verb off the same by the elderly and by 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.760
 cause of this discovery 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.690
 many years later in the 19th century I went 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.450
 invented the famous matchstick and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.980
 today thanks to me no one else gets hot 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.900
 the head to make fire only I who do 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.240
 still made of 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.670
 No chicks to get the mouth were to 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.930
 modern industry use mineral 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 phosphate rock and I am so made to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.569
 wood comes from trees that are cut 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.459
 lit with the way we the sticks 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.860
 we are manufactured 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.870
 Then we have to take a nice shower. 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.239
 Paraffin- waxing is a 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.050
 liquid that helps the fire burn my 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.060
 wood and kika before going to 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.570
 little boxes we have to be fine 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.300
 while they are manufactured 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.180
 the boxes and the kittens that can be 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.489
 made of wood or cardboard when I 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.830
 ready the factory personnel puts me 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.830
 together with the other sponsors within the 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.190
 box then put the boxes in 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.040
 packages and there we go to the shops 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.380
 despite calling me a match 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
 head does not have on match day 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.570
 she is covered with a clay 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.660
 potassium chlorate and the same phosphorus 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.120
 It is in the box Sands chlorate 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.340
 Potassium in my head when I scratch 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.540
 Sanding removes the canister some 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.959
 match screen 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.530
 this reaction makes the fire ignite throw 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.570

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.019
 potassium chloride and stay in a 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.400
 box with a backpack that has a 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:51.250
 hard hard tempo now you tupari
