all<00:00:02.040> right<00:00:02.340> here<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.700> go<00:00:02.820> it's<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.600> gravity

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
all right here you go it's a gravity

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.230 
all right here you go it's a gravity

operation is fairly simple just touch
that<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> lights<00:01:21.030> come<00:01:21.299> on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that and you see the lights come on

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.609 
that and you see the lights come on
being<00:01:22.200> sold<00:01:22.530> money<00:01:22.920> lights<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:23.970> not

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
being sold money lights are probably not

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.020

picked<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.860> properly<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:28.170> YouTube<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.400 

oh<00:01:33.850> maybe<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.300> should<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.900> maybe<00:01:36.080> we

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
oh maybe we should and maybe we

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.770 
oh maybe we should and maybe we
shouldn't<00:01:36.860> that's<00:01:37.850> pretty<00:01:38.210> simple

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
shouldn't that's pretty simple

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.230 
shouldn't that's pretty simple
make<00:01:39.170> electricity<00:01:39.770> not<00:01:39.890> very<00:01:40.130> difficult<00:01:40.370> by

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
make electricity not very difficult by

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.590 
make electricity not very difficult by
losing<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.780> lot<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.250> code<00:01:43.250> encode<00:01:43.550> energy<00:01:43.970> but

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
losing a lot of code encode energy but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.760 
losing a lot of code encode energy but
who<00:01:44.690> really<00:01:44.930> cares<00:01:45.260> also<00:01:46.010> want<00:01:46.220> electricity

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
who really cares also want electricity

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.990 
who really cares also want electricity
energy<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.860> uh<00:01:49.720> well<00:01:51.430> gotta<00:01:52.430> break<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> few<00:01:52.790> eggs

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
energy is uh well gotta break a few eggs

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.320 
energy is uh well gotta break a few eggs
you<00:01:53.600> want<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.810> make<00:01:53.900> an<00:01:54.020> omelet

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you want to make an omelet

you want to make an omelet
the<00:01:56.330> brother<00:01:56.570> resets<00:01:57.080> automatically<00:01:57.710> and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
the brother resets automatically and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.090 
the brother resets automatically and
done<00:01:58.100> really<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:58.880> gonna<00:01:59.060> get<00:01:59.300> going<00:02:00.100> you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
done really just gonna get going you

know<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.250> mean<00:02:01.490> these<00:02:01.670> lights<00:02:01.850> are<00:02:02.000> actually

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
know I mean these lights are actually

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.430 
know I mean these lights are actually
gone<00:02:03.910> wrong<00:02:04.910> choices<00:02:05.300> I'm<00:02:06.020> not<00:02:06.259> much

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
gone wrong choices I'm not much

you go what a what an easy way to make
some<00:02:22.730> electricity<00:02:23.330> huh<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.200> guys<00:02:24.380> aren't

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
some electricity huh and you guys aren't

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.640 
some electricity huh and you guys aren't
working<00:02:24.739> there<00:02:25.130> they<00:02:25.310> go<00:02:25.520> ah<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:27.230> there<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:27.530> I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
working there they go ah be there like I

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.520 
working there they go ah be there like I
said<00:02:27.890> not<00:02:28.160> much<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.580> electronics<00:02:29.239> dude<00:02:29.530> I'm

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
said not much of electronics dude I'm

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.160 
said not much of electronics dude I'm
all<00:02:30.770> in<00:02:30.950> about<00:02:31.190> working<00:02:31.610> with<00:02:31.700> my<00:02:31.820> hands<00:02:32.170> doing
