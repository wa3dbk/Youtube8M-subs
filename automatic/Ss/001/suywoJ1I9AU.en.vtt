00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.719 

we<00:01:47.140> started<00:01:47.500> off<00:01:47.649> with<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.310> Spanish

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
we started off with the Spanish

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.020 
we started off with the Spanish
influence<00:01:49.509> with<00:01:49.689> lapis<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.200> vilas<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.310> then

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
influence with lapis and vilas and then

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.270 
influence with lapis and vilas and then
we<00:01:52.240> are<00:01:52.479> now<00:01:52.689> experimenting<00:01:53.079> with<00:01:53.530> Mexican

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
we are now experimenting with Mexican

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.399 
we are now experimenting with Mexican
food<00:01:54.520> which<00:01:54.700> actually<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.689> my<00:01:55.840> opinion<00:01:55.869> goes

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
food which actually in my opinion goes

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.870 
food which actually in my opinion goes
very<00:01:56.770> very<00:01:56.950> well<00:01:57.340> with<00:01:57.520> some<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.790> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
very very well with some of the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.850 
very very well with some of the
whiskey's<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.720> glenlivet<00:01:59.170> 15<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.740> we

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
whiskey's like the glenlivet 15 that we

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.889 
whiskey's like the glenlivet 15 that we
serve<00:02:00.070> here<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.430> think<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> Spanish

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
serve here I think that the Spanish

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.570 
serve here I think that the Spanish
cuisine<00:02:02.080> itself<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.770> already<00:02:03.039> bursting<00:02:03.520> with

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
cuisine itself is already bursting with

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.490 
cuisine itself is already bursting with
flavor<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.180> we<00:02:04.330> have<00:02:04.420> got<00:02:04.450> chosen<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:05.110> go<00:02:05.259> more

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
flavor so we have got chosen to go more

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.830 
flavor so we have got chosen to go more
classic<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:06.310> that's<00:02:06.490> how<00:02:06.670> we<00:02:06.840> basically

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
classic and that's how we basically

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
classic and that's how we basically
cater<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> east<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.220> Western<00:02:10.090> palace

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.229 

what<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.709> want<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.099> was<00:02:15.250> bolder<00:02:15.700> flavors

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
what we want that was bolder flavors

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.850 
what we want that was bolder flavors
that's<00:02:16.810> able<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.200> go<00:02:17.349> with<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that's able to go with like the
