00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 hello here is good coach today 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.240
 Let's discuss the second part how to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 can use cardio efficiently 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.779
 to reduce body fat 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 I recommend you look at the first one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 video again if it is not already 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.190
 have done and here gets the now 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.410
 answer how to do it all efficiently 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 it is important that you are at the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 cardio to reduce body fat the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.059
 right intensity you have too little and he 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.850
 hardly burns anything too high and he 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.230
 burn sugar instead of fat like 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 you find the right intensity now 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 It's best to find out 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 if you take a lactate level measurement 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 makes or an oxygen gas measurement 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.000
 Do as we do 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.670
 there you will find out when that body 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 from fat mode to sugar mode 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 changes and the pulse is in between 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.130
 He could use body fat too 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.619
 to reduce 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.200
 if you are too fast on the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.720
 Burning pulse then it is 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.210
 not necessarily a good thing if you 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.310
 too little energy then implements it 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.799
 you burn almost nothing then what they do 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.060
 should do is a basic training 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.790
 in which this gives her the cardiovascular system 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.369
 tuned on one for 23 months 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 basic training schools what we too 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.350
 can find out even with us 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.509
 oxygen gas measurement then it is like that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 that the cardiovascular system is very much 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.159
 can implement more and also 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.820
 can transport relatively more fat 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.320
 and more burns my personal 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.200
 favorite recipe for cardio against fat 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.960
 is a mix between hit high 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.829
 intensity interval training and 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.490
 fat burning pulse moderate cardio 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.829
 for ten minutes with her gives 30 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 Seconds full of gas drives the pulse 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.330
 maximum height and then two 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.520
 minutes to come down 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.390
 Resist totally take out the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.790
 reiterates its 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.340
 four times in total, that's ten 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.520
 minutes have set the pure then makes 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.640
 her five minutes break and hangs afterwards 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.670
 a moderate cardio where we are now pulsing 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.650
 know to burn fat and does 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 that for at least 30 minutes 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.140
 the effect that comes out of it is 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.590
 next hit this is another 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.840
 training the body splits the fat and 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.880
 makes it available but it can not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.060
 burn oxidize 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.220
 but if we look at the moderate afterwards 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.160
 change cardio then it is plate 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.470
 ready and then it can use slowly 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.100
 and burn and that's what 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.959
 we want 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.550
 hopefully these will help you 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 Information and you can do it 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.709
 Practically implement and the next video 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.010
 Since then, it's about the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.870
 nutritional nutrition is the a and o that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.459
 to reduce most important and body fat 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.530
 I'm looking forward to the next time 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.220
 together through thick and thin 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.220
