00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the reason we put it into these piles is

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.640 
the reason we put it into these piles is
we've<00:03:07.250> decided<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.970> put<00:03:08.570> all<00:03:08.870> these<00:03:09.080> clothes

we've decided to put all these clothes

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
we've decided to put all these clothes
into<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.400> drawer<00:03:10.760> here<00:03:11.330> there<00:03:11.990> are<00:03:12.170> six

into this drawer here there are six
drawers<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.270> that's<00:03:14.930> why<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.350> have<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
drawers and so that's why we have the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.640 
drawers and so that's why we have the
specific<00:03:16.420> piles<00:03:17.420> because<00:03:17.990> each<00:03:18.260> pile<00:03:18.470> is

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
specific piles because each pile is

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.590 
specific piles because each pile is
going<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.860> go<00:03:18.980> into<00:03:19.220> one<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.580> drawers<00:03:19.850> okay
