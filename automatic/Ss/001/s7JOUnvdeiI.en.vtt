00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
connected everything's ready to go but I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.950 
connected everything's ready to go but I
didn't<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> power<00:00:32.009> cord<00:00:32.510> pushed<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
didn't have the power cord pushed in a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.280 
didn't have the power cord pushed in a
little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.719> just<00:00:36.719> had<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> plugged<00:00:37.140> in

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
little bit I just had a plugged in

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
little bit I just had a plugged in
halfway<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.100> there<00:00:38.280> was<00:00:38.370> no<00:00:38.579> power<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> was

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
halfway so there was no power and I was

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.520 
halfway so there was no power and I was
just<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.540> oh<00:00:39.750> no<00:00:41.149> about<00:00:42.149> died<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.200> just

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
just like oh no about died you know just

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
just like oh no about died you know just
that<00:00:43.649> sinking<00:00:44.040> feeling<00:00:44.250> what's<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that sinking feeling what's do a now is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
that sinking feeling what's do a now is
the<00:00:46.289> power<00:00:46.469> supplies<00:00:46.890> another<00:00:47.309> board<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.090> ram

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the power supplies another board the ram

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049 
the power supplies another board the ram
is<00:00:48.690> processing<00:00:49.530> reason<00:00:49.890> why<00:00:50.640> didn't<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.030> turn

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is processing reason why didn't it turn

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.779 
is processing reason why didn't it turn
on<00:00:51.890> didn't<00:00:52.890> turn<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.070> cuz<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> didn't<00:00:53.610> push<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
on didn't turn on cuz I didn't push the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270 
on didn't turn on cuz I didn't push the
plug-in<00:00:54.559> guess<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.800> expecting

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
plug-in guess I was just expecting

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
plug-in guess I was just expecting
something<00:00:56.670> bad<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> happen<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
something bad to happen but there it is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
something bad to happen but there it is
whoo<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> Radeon<00:01:00.949> 69<00:01:01.949> 70<00:01:02.309> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
whoo look at that if the Radeon 69 70 on

my gigabyte usb3 heavy-duty motherboard
got<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> processor<00:01:07.500> installed<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> was

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
got the processor installed that was

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
got the processor installed that was
interesting<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.140> interesting<00:01:10.290> install

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
interesting so it's interesting install

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.649 
interesting so it's interesting install
a<00:01:10.920> new<00:01:11.159> process<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:11.790> last<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.210> had<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
a new process or last one I had was the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.740 
a new process or last one I had was the
LGA<00:01:12.960> 775<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> core<00:01:14.520> two<00:01:14.640> duo<00:01:14.820> 6600

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.940 
LGA 775 on the core two duo 6600
processor<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> same

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
processor and that was a it's the same

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.200 
processor and that was a it's the same

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.520 
kind of land griddle land grid array
design<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
design but just you know you get to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.080 
design but just you know you get to
looking<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.400> used<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.000> know

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
looking at it and I got used to you know

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
looking at it and I got used to you know
I've<00:01:27.180> installed<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> bunch<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.840> athlon<00:01:28.320> sand

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I've installed a bunch of athlon sand

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
I've installed a bunch of athlon sand
crap<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> past<00:01:29.520> add<00:01:29.729> pin<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
crap like that in the past add pin so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.429 
crap like that in the past add pin so
this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.479> second<00:01:30.900> time<00:01:30.930> we've<00:01:31.170> ever<00:01:31.290> done

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
this is second time we've ever done

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.670 
this is second time we've ever done
without<00:01:31.650> pins<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.840> yeah<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> little

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
without pins and yeah it was a little

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.499 
without pins and yeah it was a little
weird<00:01:34.920> trying<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> line<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
weird trying to line it up and then I

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.550 
weird trying to line it up and then I
got<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> look<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.079> there's<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.409> little

got to look and there's two little

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.319 
got to look and there's two little
notches<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.310> side<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> line<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.210> with

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
notches on the side that line up with

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.289 
notches on the side that line up with
notches<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.430> on<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> boards<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.119> just

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
notches on that on the boards I'm just

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.389 
notches on that on the boards I'm just
like<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.590> got<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.100> and

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
can and try to get a screw in and then

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.960 
can and try to get a screw in and then
it<00:03:45.329> was<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> little<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> nightmare<00:03:46.079> but

beautiful<00:03:51.250> next<00:03:52.250> benchmark<00:03:52.730> will<00:03:52.879> probably

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
beautiful next benchmark will probably

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.699 
beautiful next benchmark will probably
be<00:03:53.299> 3dmark<00:03:54.040> 3dmark11<00:03:56.349> running<00:03:57.349> this<00:03:57.470> thing

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
be 3dmark 3dmark11 running this thing

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.319 
be 3dmark 3dmark11 running this thing
and<00:03:57.980> we'll<00:03:58.430> get<00:03:58.579> her<00:03:58.700> going<00:03:58.970> here<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.209> couple

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
and we'll get her going here in a couple

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.739 
and we'll get her going here in a couple
hours<00:03:59.739> awesome
