we<00:03:38.970> all<00:03:39.090> hope<00:03:39.329> that<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.720> show<00:03:39.930> runs<00:03:40.290> for<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
we all hope that the show runs for a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.770 
we all hope that the show runs for a
very<00:03:40.680> long<00:03:40.829> time<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.370> certainly<00:03:42.239> hope<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.630> show

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
very long time I certainly hope the show

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.839 
very long time I certainly hope the show
runs<00:03:43.139> for<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> very<00:03:43.440> long<00:03:43.560> time<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.130> yeah<00:03:44.669> I

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
runs for a very long time but yeah I

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.050 
runs for a very long time but yeah I
think<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.569> think<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.230> earliest<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.370> know<00:03:47.489> would

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
think I think it earliest you know would

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.199 
think I think it earliest you know would
be<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> couple<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.540> seasons<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:49.049> mean<00:03:50.090> they<00:03:51.090> would

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
be a couple of seasons I mean they would

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.770 
be a couple of seasons I mean they would
have<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.660> establish<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:53.340> long<00:03:53.790> time<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.299> Harvey

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
have to establish a long time of Harvey

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.030 
have to establish a long time of Harvey
Dent<00:03:54.989> being<00:03:55.169> there<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.680> think<00:03:55.859> there's<00:03:55.980> a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
Dent being there and I think there's a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.909 
Dent being there and I think there's a
lot<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.190> fun<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.609> having<00:03:56.940> Harvey<00:03:57.410> being<00:03:58.410> an

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
lot of fun and having Harvey being an

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.470 
lot of fun and having Harvey being an
ally<00:03:59.280> with<00:03:59.340> Jim<00:03:59.730> Gordon<00:04:00.000> for<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.150> long<00:04:00.299> time

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
ally with Jim Gordon for a long time

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.849 
ally with Jim Gordon for a long time

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
Harvey my Harvey Dent is a bit more of a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.659 
Harvey my Harvey Dent is a bit more of a
political<00:04:12.239> animal<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.549> willing<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.579> make

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
political animal and willing to make

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.909 
political animal and willing to make
