00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.650 
white twistys which I think these are
cool<00:02:58.230> because<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:59.310> compose<00:02:59.670> them<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.540> know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
cool because you compose them you know

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.780 
cool because you compose them you know
doing<00:03:00.960> crazy<00:03:01.230> stuff<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.250> box<00:03:02.490> they<00:03:02.670> have
