costanza stands really against Frieza

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.560

mean he easy and stronger than freeze on

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
mean he easy and stronger than freeze on
my<00:00:54.719> opinion<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> super<00:00:55.559> saiyan<00:00:55.760> well<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.120> not

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
my opinion as a super saiyan well if not

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.650 
my opinion as a super saiyan well if not
stronger<00:00:57.809> they're<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> same<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.510> when

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
stronger they're about the same but when

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
stronger they're about the same but when
Goku<00:01:01.020> turned<00:01:01.230> into<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> super<00:01:01.859> saiyan<00:01:01.890> Frieza

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
Goku turned into a super saiyan Frieza

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
Goku turned into a super saiyan Frieza
was<00:01:02.760> pretty<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:03.059> beaten<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> point<00:01:04.409> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
was pretty much beaten at that point so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
was pretty much beaten at that point so
the<00:01:04.739> power<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.220> must<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.060> been<00:01:06.299> dragged

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the power was must have been dragged

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
the power was must have been dragged
down<00:01:07.200> drastically<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.220> opinion<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
down drastically in my opinion so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.810 
down drastically in my opinion so
therefore<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.260> stronger<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.610> i<00:01:11.790> were

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
therefore he was stronger but if i were

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
therefore he was stronger but if i were
to<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> super<00:01:13.260> saiyan<00:01:13.470> i<00:01:13.860> believe

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to put them as a super saiyan i believe

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.539 
to put them as a super saiyan i believe
they're<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> same<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.040> yeah<00:01:17.040> that's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
they're about the same and yeah that's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
they're about the same and yeah that's
at<00:01:17.700> least<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:18.119> opinion<00:01:18.540> how<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
at least my opinion how I see this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 
at least my opinion how I see this
because<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> guys<00:01:20.460> remember<00:01:20.670> fees<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.450> was

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
because if you guys remember fees I was

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.590 
because if you guys remember fees I was
only<00:01:21.659> using<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.049> percent<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.040> his<00:01:23.280> power<00:01:23.610> when

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
only using one percent of his power when

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.859 
only using one percent of his power when
he<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.320> fighting<00:01:25.590> Goku<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> that's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
he was fighting Goku actually and that's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.249 
he was fighting Goku actually and that's
a<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:29.939> saying<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.630> come<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
a but I'm saying this one come for the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
a but I'm saying this one come for the
for<00:01:31.680> their<00:01:31.829> simple<00:01:32.280> fact<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.579> Goku<00:01:33.090> Goku

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
for their simple fact that Goku Goku

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
for their simple fact that Goku Goku
power<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> super<00:01:34.680> saiyan<00:01:34.829> goes<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.280> 50<00:01:35.579> times

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
power as a super saiyan goes up 50 times

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.179 
power as a super saiyan goes up 50 times
so<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.869> were<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> transform<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:37.979> there

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so if you were to transform right there

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.969 
so if you were to transform right there
and<00:01:38.340> there<00:01:38.549> he<00:01:38.759> would<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> exactly<00:01:39.630> equal<00:01:39.979> as

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
and there he would be exactly equal as

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
and there he would be exactly equal as
freezer<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.970> fiza<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.570> beaten<00:01:42.960> when<00:01:43.229> Goku

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
freezer but fiza was beaten when Goku

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
freezer but fiza was beaten when Goku
was<00:01:43.710> transformed<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.579> super<00:01:44.939> saiyan<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
was transformed into a super saiyan so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
was transformed into a super saiyan so
the<00:01:45.689> power<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:47.040> down<00:01:47.280> drastically<00:01:47.579> cuz

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the power I don't down drastically cuz

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.230 
the power I don't down drastically cuz
freezer<00:01:48.990> took<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.530> direct<00:01:50.070> attack<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.520> spirit

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
freezer took a direct attack a spirit

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.560 
freezer took a direct attack a spirit
bomb<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.780> survived<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.009> yeah<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:54.420> can

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
bomb and survived so yeah you can

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.819 
bomb and survived so yeah you can
imagine<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.079> power<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.500> must<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.740> been

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
imagine the power there must have been

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.670 
imagine the power there must have been
cut<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> half<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> imagine<00:01:58.079> when<00:01:58.409> indo

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
cut in half so I imagine when indo

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.230 
cut in half so I imagine when indo
paternity<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.280> super<00:01:59.610> saiyan<00:01:59.880> he<00:01:59.969> must've

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
paternity was super saiyan he must've

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
paternity was super saiyan he must've
been<00:02:00.270> twice<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.960> strong<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.439> freezer<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
been twice as strong as freezer and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.179 
been twice as strong as freezer and
that's<00:02:02.880> why<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.570> Frieza<00:02:03.990> turned<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.680> hundred

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that's why when Frieza turned a hundred

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.789 
that's why when Frieza turned a hundred
percent<00:02:05.420> they<00:02:06.420> were<00:02:06.479> about<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> same<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
percent they were about the same and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
percent they were about the same and
maybe<00:02:07.920> Frieza<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> little<00:02:09.030> stronger<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
maybe Frieza was a little stronger there

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.740 
maybe Frieza was a little stronger there
but<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.649> stopped<00:02:11.310> started<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.330> down

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
but then stopped started to go down

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.120 
but then stopped started to go down
basically<00:02:13.110> because<00:02:13.260> he<00:02:13.500> couldn't<00:02:13.710> handle<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
basically because he couldn't handle the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.040 
basically because he couldn't handle the
form<00:02:14.370> but<00:02:14.520> that's<00:02:14.640> another<00:02:14.820> topic<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.450> hate

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
form but that's another topic I hate

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.660 
form but that's another topic I hate

kind<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.420> doctor<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.050> remember<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.920> episode

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
kind of doctor I remember this episode

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.150 
kind of doctor I remember this episode
where<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> Lightning<00:02:57.209> was<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:58.020> know<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.739> him

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
where the Lightning was you know on him

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.550 
where the Lightning was you know on him
and<00:02:59.459> he<00:02:59.730> he<00:03:00.360> changed<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.870> little<00:03:01.050> bit<00:03:01.200> anything

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
and he he changed a little bit anything

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.500 
and he he changed a little bit anything
it<00:03:02.010> was<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.310> hard<00:03:02.520> for<00:03:02.580> him<00:03:02.790> because<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.300> power

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
it was so hard for him because the power

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.830 
it was so hard for him because the power
was<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.230> hard<00:03:04.530> actually<00:03:04.709> control<00:03:05.489> guys<00:03:06.060> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
was so hard actually control guys so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840 
was so hard actually control guys so
yeah<00:03:07.290> that's<00:03:07.560> pretty<00:03:07.709> much<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.520> me<00:03:08.640> I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
yeah that's pretty much that for me I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.790 
yeah that's pretty much that for me I
personally<00:03:09.690> believe<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.110> super<00:03:10.590> saiyan

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
personally believe that a super saiyan

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.910 
personally believe that a super saiyan
Vegeta<00:03:11.400> full<00:03:12.090> power<00:03:12.330> would<00:03:12.870> lose<00:03:13.110> against<00:03:13.800> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
Vegeta full power would lose against a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.690 
Vegeta full power would lose against a
full<00:03:14.489> power<00:03:14.700> Frieza<00:03:15.470> yeah<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.799> mean<00:03:17.160> he<00:03:17.430> could

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
full power Frieza yeah I mean he could

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.509 
full power Frieza yeah I mean he could
wear<00:03:18.060> him<00:03:18.209> down<00:03:18.299> here<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.840> there<00:03:18.959> he<00:03:19.110> could

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
wear him down here and there he could

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.039 
wear him down here and there he could
put<00:03:20.519> up<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> fight<00:03:20.940> against<00:03:21.480> him<00:03:21.660> but<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> think

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
put up a fight against him but I think

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.390 
put up a fight against him but I think
fries<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.709> stronger<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.519> faster<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.480> that's

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
fries I stronger and faster and that's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.039 
fries I stronger and faster and that's
something<00:03:26.400> very<00:03:26.580> important<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.420> win<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
something very important to win in a

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.020 
something very important to win in a
fight<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.410> my<00:03:28.440> opinion<00:03:28.830> but<00:03:29.100> that's<00:03:29.610> least<00:03:29.880> my

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
fight in my opinion but that's least my

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.880 
fight in my opinion but that's least my
opinion<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.510> believe<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.989> fiza<00:03:31.320> could<00:03:31.680> take

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
opinion I believe that fiza could take

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.180 
opinion I believe that fiza could take
this<00:03:32.130> but<00:03:32.880> not<00:03:33.269> by<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.570> by<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.080> lot<00:03:34.410> but<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:35.070> by<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
this but not by a by a lot but just by a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.060 
this but not by a by a lot but just by a
little<00:03:35.400> bit<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.730> my<00:03:35.850> opinion<00:03:36.180> would<00:03:36.390> win<00:03:36.660> this

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
little bit in my opinion would win this

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.150 
little bit in my opinion would win this
but<00:03:38.070> then<00:03:38.459> again<00:03:38.580> if<00:03:38.880> Vegeta<00:03:39.239> does<00:03:40.010> play<00:03:41.010> his

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
but then again if Vegeta does play his

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.310 
but then again if Vegeta does play his
cards<00:03:41.459> correctly<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.120> maybe<00:03:42.269> uses<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.930> full

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
cards correctly and maybe uses a full

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.380
