00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Ngati Raukawa's haka group
Motai Tangata Rau

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.400
stunned the sell-out crowd of 6000
at Te Papanui in Hamilton

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
for the Tainui kapa haka regionals

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.080
taking the title for the first time.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.280
Four groups have qualified

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.240
and will represent Tainui
at Te Matatini in 2015.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.160
Motai Tangata Rau stirred
the crowd of 6000.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.720
To hear the crowd cheer

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.640
makes all our hard work every week

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.920
and every weekend worth it.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.880
Strong performers
Te Iti Kahurangi were second.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.240
The Ngati Haua settlement

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.520
was an important aspect
of our entry.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.120
What I was taught by Meto Hopa

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.080
inspired us to use feathers
to represent quills.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.480
From Turangawaewae Marae,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.960
Te Pou o Mangatawhiri came third.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.960
Coming in fourth with their smooth
singing was Nga Pou o Roto.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.360
There was a purpose behind
the carrying of the pig

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.640
for Motai Tangata Rau.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.040
I changed our exit

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.200
in response to the government's
lack of funding given

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.600
to commemorate the battles
in NZ's history.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.240
I likened it to the pig

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.040
where they spend millions
on commemorating wars

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.080
that took place overseas.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.200
How much money will be spent

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.280
on commemorating
World War I next year?

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
So that's the message
behind our item.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.400
Potaka Maipi, Te Karere.
