the third part of the biodynamic

the third part of the biodynamic
principles<00:00:17.880> are<00:00:18.230> what<00:00:19.230> most<00:00:19.500> people<00:00:19.980> consider

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
principles are what most people consider

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000

to be by dynamics and that is the use of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.759 
to be by dynamics and that is the use of
what<00:00:23.880> we<00:00:24.000> call<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.390> biodynamic<00:00:24.810> preparations

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
what we call the biodynamic preparations

compost these are to support and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.849 
compost these are to support and
maintain<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.090> call<00:00:57.629> life<00:00:57.960> forces<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
maintain what we call life forces and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.819 
maintain what we call life forces and
this<00:00:59.550> comes<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.420> recognition<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this comes from the recognition that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.730 
this comes from the recognition that
life<00:01:02.730> comes<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:04.229> life<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.670> day<00:01:09.229> as<00:01:10.229> far

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
life comes from life to this day as far

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
life comes from life to this day as far
as<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.510> no<00:01:12.510> single<00:01:13.470> human<00:01:13.979> being<00:01:14.010> has

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
as we know no single human being has

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.130 
as we know no single human being has
every<00:01:15.689> seen<00:01:15.720> ever<00:01:16.500> seen<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.900> living<00:01:18.900> entity

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
every seen ever seen a living entity

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
every seen ever seen a living entity
come<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.580> non<00:01:20.939> living<00:01:21.390> entity<00:01:22.580> for

example<00:01:24.500> tractors<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.520> baby

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
example tractors do not have baby

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.390 
example tractors do not have baby
tractors<00:01:27.799> cows<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:29.340> baby<00:01:29.640> cows<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:32.189> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
tractors cows have baby cows so if you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.670 
tractors cows have baby cows so if you
look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.759> living<00:01:33.090> organisms<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.119> life

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
look at living organisms it is the life

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.280 
look at living organisms it is the life
that<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:39.439> animates<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:41.840> which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
that that animates them which is the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.219 
that that animates them which is the
source<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.920> other<00:01:44.159> life<00:01:44.490> comes<00:01:44.909> from<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
source that other life comes from and so

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.310 
source that other life comes from and so
again<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.420> agriculture<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.140> its

again in agriculture because of its
exploitive<00:01:50.040> nature<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:51.119> only<00:01:51.390> remove

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380

if you have a cow in time that cow will
