pumpkin<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.490> steamer<00:01:10.759> because<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:11.450> is

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
pumpkin to the steamer because this is

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.690 
pumpkin to the steamer because this is
going<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.959> steam<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.259> lot<00:01:12.560> quicker<00:01:13.039> than<00:01:13.340> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
going to steam a lot quicker than the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.839 
going to steam a lot quicker than the
potatoes<00:01:14.149> so<00:01:14.420> we're<00:01:14.569> doing<00:01:14.810> stages<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:16.700> it's

potatoes so we're doing stages so it's

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.969 
potatoes so we're doing stages so it's
probably<00:01:17.270> being<00:01:17.479> 5<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:18.080> 10<00:01:18.289> minutes<00:01:18.590> since<00:01:18.800> we

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
probably being 5 to 10 minutes since we

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.559 
probably being 5 to 10 minutes since we
put<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.250> potatoes<00:01:19.399> on<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.149> you<00:01:20.209> can<00:01:20.360> see

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
nice sort of small size so that it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.380 
nice sort of small size so that it
doesn't<00:01:36.590> take<00:01:36.739> too<00:01:37.039> long<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.489> this<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.060> one<00:01:38.360> of

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
doesn't take too long and this is one of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.440 
doesn't take too long and this is one of
the<00:01:38.539> tricks<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.959> making<00:01:39.380> meals<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:40.009> lot<00:01:40.450> faster

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
the tricks of making meals a lot faster

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.930 
the tricks of making meals a lot faster
things<00:01:42.140> like<00:01:42.440> steaming<00:01:42.890> your<00:01:43.190> vegetables<00:01:43.729> and

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
also chopping them into smaller pieces

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.650 
also chopping them into smaller pieces
it's<00:01:45.709> just<00:01:45.890> going<00:01:46.039> to<00:01:46.130> save<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.340> lot<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.580> time<00:01:46.880> so

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's just going to save a lot of time so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.240 
it's just going to save a lot of time so
