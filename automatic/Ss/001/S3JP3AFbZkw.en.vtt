00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 Recently, the Wii Community is eagerly awaiting a dance game 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.800
 Karow mixes bogey in stores 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 with now hit and TUI Blood swing the ovens 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.700
 with the included microphone is there because we have good mood hits like clouds and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.290
 Sunshine or Storz down coaches 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.290
 he can not go wrong or anything 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.700
 ca at the beginning of the game world of five characters the relatively free 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.920
 designed and Smith outfits were tenth 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.409
 Unfortunately, Breuer Elvis can not integrate games into the game 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.329
 is your alter ego created 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.509
 The game changes into a successful tutorial that gives you the controls 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.009
 well known here is the first little disillusionment 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.870
 the dance itself is here she is knitted very simple 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.840
 so you do not have to do with the wii-mote about fish dance maneuvers 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.010
 but the remote control only always in time 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.140
 and below 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 or move from right to left 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.490
 with the D-pad or the Nunchuk Male you find the character in 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.910
 different areas of each stage 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.910
 so as to collect per the subpoints 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.329
 The rights bar is not only about the clock 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.729
 but shows ran 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.199
 why these so-called "special moves" can be performed 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.290
 the n-ergie bar is well filled 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.769
 enough pressure has to offer as well 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.709
 Thus, a small window opens up at the bottom of the screen 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.829
 the directions that lead to success 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.469
 everyone just grabs the controls on this Edwards feature 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.049
 you did it anyway 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.609
 reward the game with a typical animation and many 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.709
 extra points 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.950
 Incidentally, each character has individual dance styles between the 4 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.459
 in a limited context during the game can change 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.679
 at least 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.769
 Karch 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.769
 BKK 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.589
 the second part of the game consists of the sewer pipe UKE mode the pretty 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.899
 strong Aniston NieÃŸing Israel has 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:14.249
 Singing along with the songs makes them sing along 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.059
 Achievements and pickaxes points 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:22.029
 however, the journalistic BaFin comparison to Sony Spa TI Kracher is right 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:22.749
 weak 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.919
 the voice recognition is moderate 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.769
 bad singers are usually rewarded just as well as offspring is ready 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.769
 you could almost hold a vacuum cleaner to the microphone 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.529
 would have it anyway 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.099
 as a nice extra, the Movie Maker turns out with the help of her your 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.390
 feats 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.010
 with perfect force 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.010
 cut and save as a video clip 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:05.289
 for as well-founded games especially in Estoril mode it hailed so-called wore 

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:07.539
 Andy whom their new stages 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.069
 Unlock outfits and music 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.349
 for example, and Stierli image supplemented by Britney Baldy Spears 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.479
 but Hey, who wants to unlock that voluntarily 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.710
 the selection of music in general is quite successful but the range goes from 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.060
 good mood classics as hardly seen incident 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.630
 Euro the Award and pack you Sixt up to halfway modern pieces like 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.590
 Bora murder at one of three francs or the round of the Pussycat Dolls 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.199
 however, all the trucks are over 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.499
 Karrer version 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:50.959
 external devices to Lahr after Rom-ciampino scored is Bubi's 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.090
 especially single player mode a game 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.939
 the missed opportunities 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.709
 Super look great track list but a violation of the gameplay and thus 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:04.770
 Lack of depth costs the game many motivational points 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.629
 the possibilities of the Wii were not even used a pity 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.080
 Nevertheless, the title is still fun in party mode 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.789
 he can be recognized by the weaknesses of control and voice 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.919
 For the most part look away and spend a fun evening with friends 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.539
 who can use his as much as a game and game console 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.569
 to move just because of those who hardly want to look into these 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.580
 See alternatives once 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.370
 Lone fighter Play then rather sample
