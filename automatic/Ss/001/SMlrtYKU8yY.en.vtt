00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 diet you have more chances to lower 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 of weight this is because it is rich in 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.580
 antioxidants amino acids and also in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.500
 fiber you want to know more about 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.840
 benefits limit you accompany me in the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.750
 following 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.360
 [Music] 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.500
 but does not have satiety for longer than 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.990
 according to an investigation carried out 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.270
 by the National Polytechnic Institute 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.939
 ipe n is confirmed that the chia seed 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.320
 really helps you avoid periods of 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.660
 Eat others especially when we have 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.699
 like little pickets or we just want to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170
 idlers here the key is because when 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.120
 is combined with the water has the 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.170
 ability to increase up to 12 times more 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.489
 its volume so the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.110
 recommendations that influence you 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.300
 everyday way so that this way 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.500
 have the energy the nutrients and 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.510
 also remember that the seeds of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.969
 Chia obviously helps you take better 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.410
 decisions because it practically goes 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.660
 to channel certain emotions in your 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.700
 brain so you'll have much more 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.190
 calm and reduce around stars 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.790
 since he can teach between diaby point 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.680
 number 2 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.270
 reduces the volume of body mass in 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.399
 this research done by the ips 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.470
 Check that when you include the seed 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.450
 of chia in your diet and remember that 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.580
 Ideally, it should be 1 to 2 tablespoons 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 coffee makers throughout the day is that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.119
 you start reducing sizes especially in 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.430
 the case of women is very clear in 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.320
 the level of the hip and abdomen and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.390
 for example for about 10 days you can 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.920
 start noticing the change that's because 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.479
 the amino acids and the fiber that 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.500
 contains the chia seed since 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.690
 work have 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.980
 better digestion and if that was not enough you 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.380
 helps to prevent fluid retention 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.540
 that sometimes for periods of stress 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.430
 or because of climatic factors we usually 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.380
 increase the volume and in this way you 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.630
 You can have the guarantee that you will lose 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.700
 sizes in a short time point number three 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.380
 you eliminate toxins one of the big 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.510
 goodness of the chia seed is that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.369
 has the capacity to assimilate the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.140
 carbohydrates in the form of energy and not 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.150
 as fats to give you an idea for 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.950
 example if in your diet consume some 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.570
 complex carbohydrate or some type 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.820
 of sugar instead of it really 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.140
 can convert this into fat what 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.880
 you practically go to the chia seed 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.590
 is that you simply have the energy 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.090
 extra to perform a physical activity 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.890
 and here the recommendation is that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.600
 obviously you try without pretending 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.369
 healthy diet where 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 consume lots of vegetables and 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.209
 remember that the key is also to move 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.800
 so that this way really if you enjoy 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.390
 of all the benefits that this gives you 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.400
 product that is also rich in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.380
 antioxidants and that invariably you 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.810
 they will give energy strength and that is going to 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.790
 see reflected in a smaller volume and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 also in a smaller amount of toxins 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.500
 in your body point number 4 how it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.120
 prepares a very practical way of 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.800
 include chia seeds in your diet 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.090
 is that 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.590
 approximately one liter of natural water 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.300
 what you are going to do is put 2 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.160
 coffee spoons of the seeds of 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.110
 chÃ­a you will let it rest throughout 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.430
 the night and the next day the only thing that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.290
 we're going to do is move on in another 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.540
 container where the eye can be in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.190
 your cylinder when you go to the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.380
 office or school and we're going to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.300
 add the juice of two lemons then what 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.520
 you're going to mix during the day I followed 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.020
 taking as use water remember that 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.700
 here the recommendation is not that you 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.230
 finish the liter automatically 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.910
 you can take small sips and 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.590
 combine them with natural water and from that 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.300
 way your metabolism should be treated 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.100
 accelerate and the recommendation that they give you 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.720
 the nutrition experts is that 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.670
 try to consume the chia seed 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.620
 especially before 7 pm 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.330
 because remember that what is going to start 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 to do is to activate so you can 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.019
 then have a restful sleep here 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.180
