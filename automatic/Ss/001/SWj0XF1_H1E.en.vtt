00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.750 
with a layer of 10 ounce glass first
plain<00:01:03.620> weave<00:01:03.830> then<00:01:04.760> I<00:01:04.850> do<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.180> 90<00:01:06.190> 0<00:01:07.190> UT

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
plain weave then I do the 90 0 UT

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.930 
plain weave then I do the 90 0 UT
directional<00:01:08.360> stitch<00:01:09.310> one<00:01:10.310> layer<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.670> and

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
directional stitch one layer that and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.420 
directional stitch one layer that and
then<00:01:11.150> file<00:01:11.860> finish<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:13.010> off<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.159> another

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
then file finish it off with another

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.090 
then file finish it off with another
layer<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:13.940> 10<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:17.409> haven't<00:01:18.409> really<00:01:18.560> finished

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
layer of 10 I haven't really finished

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.399 
layer of 10 I haven't really finished
the<00:01:19.400> front<00:01:19.610> deck<00:01:20.030> yet<00:01:20.270> but<00:01:20.510> I<00:01:20.540> do<00:01:20.659> have<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.990> flat

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.230 
the front deck yet but I do have a flat
platform<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:22.220> there<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.520> think<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.850> can<00:01:23.060> see

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.920 
platform in there and think you can see
that<00:01:24.100> but<00:01:25.100> anyway

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
that but anyway

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.050 
that but anyway
next<00:01:26.710> up<00:01:26.860> here<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:27.870> I'm<00:01:28.870> going<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.790> back<00:01:30.790> these

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
next up here is I'm going to back these

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.450 
next up here is I'm going to back these
the<00:01:31.720> edge<00:01:31.840> up<00:01:32.110> here<00:01:32.380> with<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.620> piece<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:32.980> wood<00:01:33.280> on

the edge up here with a piece of wood on
the<00:01:33.580> inside<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.990> I'm<00:01:35.110> going<00:01:35.230> to<00:01:35.260> put<00:01:35.500> some<00:01:35.730> so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
the inside and I'm going to put some so

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.719 
the inside and I'm going to put some so
I<00:01:36.790> can<00:01:36.940> Center<00:01:37.300> my<00:01:37.990> top<00:01:38.230> in<00:01:39.010> relation<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.670> where

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
I can Center my top in relation to where

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.460 
I can Center my top in relation to where
the<00:01:39.880> bottom<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.600> pick<00:01:40.750> up<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.020> existing

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
the bottom is and pick up the existing

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.860 
the bottom is and pick up the existing
holes<00:01:41.710> because<00:01:42.430> they<00:01:42.610> kind<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.970> didn't<00:01:43.660> really

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
holes because they kind of didn't really

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.370 
holes because they kind of didn't really
go<00:01:43.990> back<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.970> perfect<00:01:45.970> perfect<00:01:46.119> but<00:01:46.600> whenever

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
go back on perfect perfect but whenever

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.380 
go back on perfect perfect but whenever
I<00:01:47.590> cut<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:47.920> apart<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.430> this<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.119> what<00:01:49.270> I'm

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
I cut it apart and this is what I'm

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.000 
I cut it apart and this is what I'm
figures<00:01:49.900> gonna<00:01:50.110> hold<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.410> together<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.740> the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
figures gonna hold it together for the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.850 
figures gonna hold it together for the
first<00:01:51.280> bit<00:01:52.140> until<00:01:53.140> i<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:53.290> everything<00:01:53.410> laid

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
first bit until i get everything laid

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.800 
first bit until i get everything laid
out

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.539 

so<00:01:57.229> here<00:01:57.500> we<00:01:57.649> are<00:02:00.070> don't<00:02:01.070> really<00:02:01.310> know<00:02:01.399> what

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
so here we are don't really know what

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.630 
so here we are don't really know what
else<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.909> say<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:03.979> haven't<00:02:04.490> already

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
else to say but I haven't already

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.889 
else to say but I haven't already
covered<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.590> my<00:02:06.740> workstation<00:02:07.670> I<00:02:08.119> just

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
covered this is my workstation I just

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.910 
covered this is my workstation I just
cleaned<00:02:09.110> up<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.380> little<00:02:09.440> bit<00:02:09.709> whether<00:02:10.220> or<00:02:10.340> not

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
cleaned up a little bit whether or not

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.759 
cleaned up a little bit whether or not
so<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.519> next<00:02:13.670> step<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.769> support

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
so the next step is just that support

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.500 
so the next step is just that support
the<00:02:15.800> edges<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.519> then<00:02:16.910> I'm<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.239> going<00:02:17.420> to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the edges and then I'm just going to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
the edges and then I'm just going to
have<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.690> take<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.080> dive<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.620> start<00:02:19.190> cutting

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
have to take the dive and start cutting

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.160 
have to take the dive and start cutting
it<00:02:19.720> cutting<00:02:20.720> their<00:02:20.810> part<00:02:22.540> number<00:02:23.540> taking

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
it cutting their part number taking

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.970 
it cutting their part number taking
these<00:02:24.260> apart<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.830> take<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
these apart now you have to take the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.820 
these apart now you have to take the
front<00:02:28.250> nav<00:02:28.910> light<00:02:29.150> off<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.610> jazz<00:02:31.910> so
