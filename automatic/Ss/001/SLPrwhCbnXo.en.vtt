00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 I call good wax tony 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.540
 I have about a year and a half 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.059
 volunteer firefighter 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.150
 and my passion started with this for my dad 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:18.500
 and dad but volunteers over 20 years 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 Oh, it's me, I was in my house, come on 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 we are watching a movie 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.830
 lying down we listen on the radio being the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.500
 first people that we arrived 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.480
 It was very strong because we saw cars in 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.540
 flames and how people do not know they 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.890
 despairing screaming firefighters but 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.239
 good but we are not but 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.710
 we say in full to accept 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.960
 preparations 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.160
 at the start there are no weapons unity of people 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.230
 from other sides firefighters 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.710
 from the north the south from everywhere 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.190
 to what they were ventilating we see a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.170
 sir that came out this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.899
 He stuck his head out there because already so much 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.399
 that you could not see then we saw the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.549
 sir who pulled his head then the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.400
 people as good people as trying 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.700
 I did not think about it and dad told me go up and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.530
 up because you can not think intense 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.369
 with a second 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.979
 not presenting then because you can not 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:23.680
 to think that I have family 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.680
 my mom my hand or you do not have anyone 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 the palm held the ladder I went up like this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 when he came to the window 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.710
 but there were two people 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.710
 then I felt just that they chose the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.350
 then I realized there was a coat 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.799
 there was already a companion next to me 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.840
 then with the center we get 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.640
 three people the three people we caught 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 and we take out the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.140
 the elders were inside the house 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.100
 and another fireman on the stairs 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.040
 waiting to be able to take it out you know 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.990
 you need more people so why 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.330
 so there is no such fire between 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.420
 firefighters and if you really love 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.170
 and you like it 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.170
 for all your life
