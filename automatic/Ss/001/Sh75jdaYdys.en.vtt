00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.379
 a new device that came as a replica of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.379
 iphone 5 s 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.080

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:29.200

 open as original those screws 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.870
 special to have that release case 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.550
 possibility to increase memory 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.930
 flash it in case it comes with 8 gb of 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 internal memory 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.880
 this internal memory can be expanded 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.660
 up to 64 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:03.220
 just change the chip and have an internal chip 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.239
 studio Strip replaces're're calling 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.239
 he to you 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.620
 knowing that the android 4.2.1 2 and rolling 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.960
 one s 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.479
 This handset is a quad core is the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.840
 only one I've seen there but 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:33.550
 quad-core 1.3 all other clubs 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.780
 certain is a gift cobb 1.2 and if it does not have 512 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.300
 Ram washer angina or whether it is 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 double the performance of the others I 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.810
 I have observed your quad core 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.590
 processor has twice the performance 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.360
 practically double the memory 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.890
 remembering that the internal memory is 8 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.670
 can be expanded to 64 all 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 Perfect 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:10.729
 rolling the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.729
 antÃ´nio santi it's operational 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.370
 very good led flashlight very good 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.610
 photos of him are very clear I had 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:29.430
 comparing with the original or intimate 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.220
 for being a camera also another detail 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.459
 important for all other devices 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.110
 they offer a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:46.140
 this 8-megapixel camera is not 5 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.569
 so besides being a quad core having a gb 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.209
 of ram double the performance 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.720
 of the others, all others offer a 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.480
 5 megapixel camera that is an 8 camera in 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.859
 back and the front camera is 2 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.950
 megapixels 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.989
 He is far superior 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.390
 the very good device just arrived and 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:12.079
 if the touch is turning it off you 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.079
 to observe 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.190
 show his sides 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.150
 the dimensions are perfect the little duds 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:41.100

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:47.390
 enters perfectly in him because he has 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.390
 all faithful dimensions or the original 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.400
 Okay, now, the piece of land you 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.400
 take a look at his manual 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.010

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:10.090

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.090
 Yes, I own a data cable. 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.290
 loading the 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.510

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:36.250
 note 10 there I can say 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.580
 Repeating, I like to do this. 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:45.220
 he is not an alcoholic is a quad core and 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:48.610
 if you have 1 gb of ram its camera is 8 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.000
 megapixels and internal memory 8 gillette 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.900
 also remembering opening in the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.300
 side 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.490
 releasing studio it can be expanded 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.450
 until 64 ok 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.540
 it is a micro sd of memory is only 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.510
 replace it gets 64 from renan 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.010
 That's good, people. This is the video. 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.860
 all doubts that no longer 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.520
