00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello to all Italian authors on the run 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.559
 we are recording this and April until 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.889
 April 2013 and so I want to talk to you 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.080
 of the upcoming elections in Australia but 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.449
 especially how these this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.840
 election period will affect the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 news that you will read about 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.710
 immigration to Australia are 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 already talking about the politicians of how 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 they will modify various migration laws 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.219
 to expand, the flow must be reduced 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 migratory so I just wanted to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.809
 share mine 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.430
 my opinion for what concerns 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.149
 how to read this news 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 I think we all need to deal with 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.860
 with pliers read them with pliers 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.680
 because practically the politicians are 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 promising what according to them a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.809
 will get them more votes in September 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 the lessons will take place precisely 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.189
 September I'm talking about the elections a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.010
 federal level then for all 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.110
 australia and then and there are the various 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.409
 political parties and basically two 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.220
 the Labor and liberal who are 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.990
 saying various things relatively 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.909
 immigration therefore for example the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.049
 Labor party that is in power now 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.380
 is saying that it will reduce a lot e 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.380
 this will do so before the elections 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 the giving of visas 457 of those of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:40.110
 type working in temporary because 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 say companies are some 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.320
 companies are taking advantage of the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.610
 this type of visa to offer to the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.729
 I work for foreigners by underpaying them instead 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.130
 that of offering work to Australians 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.360
 so they say we want them 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.860
 Australians are put on pole 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.500
 position for what concerns i 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.259
 work and then we remove this type o 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.410
 we reduce this type of revised punish 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.780
 companies 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 I take advantage of one single clarification on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.180
 current immigration minister for 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.540
 immigration which is an ex in australia 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 trade unionist and therefore in a certain sense a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.050
 a fairly biased point of view 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.960
 I would like to say then there is immediately to say 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.350
 that second they didn't say 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.860
 how many and how many have said how many 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.690
 say 10,000 companies took advantage 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.750
 of the visa are rubbing the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.580
 Australians, however, no longer provided 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.220
 more detailed information about it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.920
 so in short we have to trust the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.050
 their words the other part the liberals 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.850
 conservatives are much more pro business 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:04.480
 so basically it seems to understand 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.210
 that theirs has their attitude towards 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.660
 the visa this type of visa is a lot 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.600
 more liberal therefore neither will offer not 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.630
 I say more but probably not 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.240
 will reduce and then it is precisely of 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 go and see where they are trying to 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.560
 get the votes 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.830
 the most important thing to remember 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:32.920
 according to me it is that regardless of 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.690
 who promises what and what end of April today 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.140
 2013 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.940
 it seems that if the government continues this way 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.420
 Labor will not be reconfirmed then 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.760
 the government will change color then 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.100
 all the promises or things that come 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.989
 probably from today to September 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.890
 they are not valid enabled by the del 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.800
 Labor government because it is likely 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.220
 we will see that the government will change and therefore 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.130
 so it will be overturned so all 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.220
 news that people are at 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.710
 they are practically reducing the number 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.830
 of visas are taking everyone out of there 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.540
 etc. etc. you own are you are 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.050
 doing they are talking etc. 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.020
 etc. but remember that we are in 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.860
 election campaign and therefore they are 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.380
 just trying to scrape together Votes 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.930
 various polling stations especially those 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.830
 more marginal and the question 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.810
 immigration, albeit limited 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.270
 may be in numerical terms a 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.660
 national level for Australia in 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.820
 some in some polling stations 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.120
 quite important enough for 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.100
 some people therefore parties think 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.740
 that can make the difference 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.380
 I repeat, I think we need to take the 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.990
 news with pliers those promised with 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.180
 the pliers as always and again 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.320
 probably after 7 September 2013 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.680
 things will change anyway 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.180
 probably more positively for 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.210
 immigrants 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.010
 however this is not guaranteed thanks 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.640
 thousand see you soon on the cuts of 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.640
 escape hello hello
