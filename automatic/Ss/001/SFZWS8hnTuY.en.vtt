00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.590
 around 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.170

 sio 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.850
 So what you need are actually only supermarket JAL we 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.880

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.540
 we work Dieter

 Fortmann Punjab and of course doors 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.760
 Here come the door go and the call center frame 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.450
 if Manfred wants 3 minutes at the moment, he has to go for a torch 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.390
 Brett has been increasing recently 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.240
 Doug Spradley just arrives to have a wiki 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.300
 and Japan always a little bit up on me 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 a little bit slower for a second sleep course 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.400
 Prof 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.500
 and she has to take note then that is open for the time being 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.320
 she is awesome 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.549
 and then also corn syrup to 04 why I now from the coma 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.719
 she again Metzelthin cool because mental about where I am now 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.850
 to kick the press and and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 the time liaison officials do not save themselves 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.950
 and that's why the sanction makes it a little deeper 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.630
 for corporations 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.710
 Living years are also pretty good 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.100
 good Berlin 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.350
 Zero just keeps connecting 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.970
 Seer, where I come here now the other press places "That mined next 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.840
 years 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.850
 with one opposite 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.869
 and second, we just need it now 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:17.059
 Zugspitze arrives Mamut are viruses from bacteria 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.939
 and - you can hear it 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.289
 Achieve Euro 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.170
 Crown 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.170
 as it does not help more to Storm 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:29.769
 and it covers 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.529
 and connect just like that 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.309
 Billions are here again 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.069
 get in touch 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.069
 and then we just happen 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:47.179
 and that's actually synonymous of the connecting whole reactions 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.369
 things very much 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.369
 good Bachem rail press cookies 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.639
 put two doors 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.989
 and how to do it a bit 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.349
 and put others on again 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.189
 it is not for the reason 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.219
 but I do not see any scope until now is take my cap and 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.809
 it works 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.249
 from both sides still good red 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.299
 century 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.179
 is bookable and will be 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.229
 how it should be 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:20.719
 I'm sorry because 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.319
 The press must kick a ball behind the ball if it is right here 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.849
 Do you buy electricity? 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.849
 that's not what she's supposed to do, that's why she set it back further 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.079
 we're not going to build Swimming Cen again 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.359
 book yes 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.359
 still, that's a bit more with the 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.539
 Wood tone and then I do it like her 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:51.799
 Netzer mediopolitically make her intervene Ines Scholz was now 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.149
 Flowers is an ICE's 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.429

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.679
 Armstrong Kauffels 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.309
 but in the bottom have 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.349
 how the door can open on to with the switch is on 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.729
 May concluding 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.599
 yes it was already off 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.299

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.599
