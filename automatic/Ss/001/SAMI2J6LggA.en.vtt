I am going to start seeing changes it's
kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> saying<00:02:28.500> goes<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:29.160> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
kind of like the saying goes if you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.059 
kind of like the saying goes if you
plant<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> seed<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.480> fruit<00:02:30.750> will<00:02:30.930> grow<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.770> in

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
plant the seed the fruit will grow so in

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.530 
plant the seed the fruit will grow so in
this<00:02:32.190> case<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.640> kind<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> plant

this case is kind of like if you plant

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.740 
this case is kind of like if you plant
the<00:02:33.720> seed<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:33.989> water<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:35.239> your<00:02:36.239> hair<00:02:36.510> will

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
three days maybe every four days if I'm

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.259 
three days maybe every four days if I'm
fortunate<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.400> since<00:03:23.700> I've<00:03:23.820> been<00:03:23.970> drinking

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
fortunate but since I've been drinking

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.610 
fortunate but since I've been drinking
all<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:24.480> water<00:03:24.720> i<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.109> not<00:03:25.260> had<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
all this water i have not had to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.400 
all this water i have not had to
exfoliate<00:03:25.799> at<00:03:26.579> all<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.269> i<00:03:27.570> do<00:03:27.630> believe<00:03:27.840> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
exfoliate at all and i do believe that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.580 
exfoliate at all and i do believe that
it's<00:03:28.709> because<00:03:29.190> from<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> water<00:03:30.329> my<00:03:31.320> skin

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it's because from all the water my skin

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.280 
it's because from all the water my skin
is<00:03:31.709> being<00:03:32.100> like<00:03:32.700> extra<00:03:33.120> hydrated<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.200> do

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
is being like extra hydrated so I do

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.580 
is being like extra hydrated so I do
feel<00:03:34.799> good<00:03:35.070> about<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.910> part<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.810> I'm
