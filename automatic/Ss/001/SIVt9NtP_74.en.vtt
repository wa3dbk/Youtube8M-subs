condenser<00:00:21.980> mic<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:24.150> XLR<00:00:24.750> version<00:00:25.230> which

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
condenser mic and the XLR version which

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
condenser mic and the XLR version which
is<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.949> was<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.789> amazing<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.420> they<00:00:27.539> made<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is this was so amazing that they made a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.410 
is this was so amazing that they made a
USB<00:00:28.320> version<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:29.010> people<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.429> us<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.240> was

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
USB version for people like us but I was

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.389 
USB version for people like us but I was
dumb<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.750> got<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> XLR<00:00:31.470> version<00:00:31.859> mistakenly

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
dumb and got the XLR version mistakenly

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
dumb and got the XLR version mistakenly
so<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.570> me<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> won't<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> home

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
so if you like me I won't have a home

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
so if you like me I won't have a home
studio<00:00:34.860> either<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.820> works<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> XLR<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
studio either one works but the XLR is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.540 
studio either one works but the XLR is
definitely<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.160> more<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> an

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
definitely going to be more of an

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
definitely going to be more of an
investment<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> XLR<00:00:40.590> that's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
investment because with the XLR that's

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.319 
investment because with the XLR that's
not<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.399> doesn't<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.700> plug<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
not it doesn't just plug into the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
not it doesn't just plug into the
computer<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.350> learned<00:00:43.620> like<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> first

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
computer which I learned like the first

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
computer which I learned like the first
time<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> kept<00:00:45.210> trying<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> plug<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
time I got it I kept trying to plug it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
time I got it I kept trying to plug it
somewhere<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> computer<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.579> just

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
somewhere in the computer and it it just

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.439 
somewhere in the computer and it it just
wouldn't<00:00:48.270> go<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.780> sucked<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:51.059> had<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
wouldn't go and that sucked so I had to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
wouldn't go and that sucked so I had to
buy<00:00:51.660> an<00:00:51.870> audio<00:00:52.230> interface<00:00:52.410> box<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
buy an audio interface box and then I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.959 
buy an audio interface box and then I
had<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> buy<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.920> cable<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.250> plug<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
had to buy a cable to plug in from the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.849 
had to buy a cable to plug in from the
audio<00:00:57.210> interface<00:00:57.629> box<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> computer<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
audio interface box to the computer and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
audio interface box to the computer and
yeah<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.789> definitely<00:01:00.059> investment<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
yeah that's definitely investment and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.630 
yeah that's definitely investment and
what<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.379> saving<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
what I'm actually saving up for is a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.000 
what I'm actually saving up for is a
better<00:01:03.449> audio<00:01:03.960> interface<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
better audio interface like a just a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
better audio interface like a just a
mixer<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.880> would<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.049> make<00:01:07.049> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
mixer because that would just make this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.760 
mixer because that would just make this
a<00:01:07.500> whole<00:01:07.830> lot<00:01:07.860> easier<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.880> worth<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.500> if

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
a whole lot easier and worth it but if

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
a whole lot easier and worth it but if
you<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:12.659> really

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you don't want all that don't really

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
you don't want all that don't really
need<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.680> could<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
need all that you could just get the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
need all that you could just get the
audio<00:01:15.270> technica<00:01:15.659> at2020<00:01:16.409> USB<00:01:17.720> version<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
audio technica at2020 USB version the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
audio technica at2020 USB version the
USB<00:01:20.189> version<00:01:20.369> does<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> exact<00:01:21.150> same<00:01:21.180> thing

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
USB version does the exact same thing
except<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.170> i'm<00:01:22.259> recording<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.950> here
