00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.469
 in side 

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.469
 in the champions 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.870
 for many of whom I am more than I 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.430
 I bring a new video 25 online and this 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.859
 time friends as you are seeing in the 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.039
 images I bring you a trick to be able 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.990
 moderate our car so much is worth our 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.269
 vehicle in case there is someone who does not 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.550
 he knows what modeling is like we're going 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.349
 to click the car but quiet that 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.990
 We are not going to use motorcycles or jacksons 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.730
 nothing weird is worth it 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.020
 it could be done but with many hacks and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.660
 all that and this time we're going to do it 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.160
 by a very very easy click then 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.320
 guys , I did it on playstation 4 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.520
 but I think it works on xbox 360 and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.840
 playstation 3 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.880
 if you're not seeing for yourself in case there's 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.500
 someone who does not know what it is to moderate you are 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 seeing I have my point that lacks the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.890
 back that is super super 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.500
 cool as he has the tube as loose 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.750
 the lights of alante I have them as 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.490
 in the air I have it without a roof and some 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.020
 little things more that I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.580
 next the first thing we're going to 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.710
 do guys already being inside the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.079
 just saints we're going to body and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.550
 we buy carbon mudguards 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.710
 once purchased we will have 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.660
 / body of series and mudguards 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.000
 carbon very quickly how am I 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.490
 doing me now ok you're going to see what 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 so much intercalating so fast is going to get 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.910
 a point that you will stay in body 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.430
 series and it's going to stay invisible like 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.960
 you see is super super handsome and now we 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.820
 let's go to the roof we're going to do 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.040
 exactly the same thing we buy roof of 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.750
 film made of carbon fiber and we're going to 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.010
 intercalar super super fast I os 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.690
 I recommend that you put a finger in the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.340
 top part on the arrow above and 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.830
 another finger on the little arrow below and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.720
 you give very quickly until you see that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.030
 It stays invisible and you stay on top 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 standard roof and then the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.920
 they select vale then Chinese now 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.690
 month that is super super handsome is worth and 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.000
 we go to the bumper part 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.500
 which is a bit more complicated but 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.410
 you will see that there will be a super car 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.780
 super handsome super weird and very and very 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.100
 different is worth now as you see we are going 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.290
 to have to buy the bumper 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.330
 frontal with stickers is worth what 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.500
 we buy that this bumper and we're going to 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.080
 have to intersperse between 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.790
 bumper with stickers and just the one 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.410
 up is as you see upstairs down 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.870
 up down down up all the time 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.880
 quiet that comes out, you do not have to 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.010
 Give enough with patience 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.660
 to take nothing a few minutes of anything and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.310
 now you will see that it stretches up 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.230
 the little arrow may be that it has us 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.990
 up and you will see that you des 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.880
 clichÃ© to vale is a souped up guys to me 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.860
 I loved it now you will see that I continue 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.570
 trying because at the beginning I did not leave 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 but as you can see when you throw a little 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.070
 up and I'm out of bumper 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.320
 Shooting above all and selected 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.240
 the series is worth as you see is a 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.760
 super weird car with the lights as well as 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.730
 flying is not spoiled enchanted and then 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.280
 we 're going to the front of the rear of 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.590
 series and let's buy the butt I think 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.330
 which was the coal if we are going to buy 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.830
 the carbon one and we're going to intersperse another 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.960
 same time but as you see here yes a lot 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.790
 easier and now you will see that when tuning it 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.920
 put the tube and all that will be 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.690
 super handsome the most guys here you see that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.760
 we are already out of the high positions already 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.500
 I fought it to the fullest, I overtook it and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.570
 As you can see, it has the flaps 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.340
 transparent without the bumper 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.020
 back that with the tube that was gorgeous 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.380
 the front lights that remain as 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.600
 floating without a roof above with the neon 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.310
 he looks very handsome and the wheels and everything 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.900
 that and nothing more guys to see if we can 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.640
 get to 300 lights for this dresser 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.640
 subscription until next time
