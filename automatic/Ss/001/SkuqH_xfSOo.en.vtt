00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.170 
and this camera really has to do was the
that<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.480> super<00:02:25.050> CCD<00:02:25.530> EXO<00:02:26.100> sensor<00:02:26.610> technology

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that the super CCD EXO sensor technology

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.110 
that the super CCD EXO sensor technology
that's<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.110> S<00:02:28.230> 200<00:02:28.740> versus<00:02:29.070> es<00:02:29.340> 100<00:02:29.880> right

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's on the S 200 versus es 100 right

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.520 
that's on the S 200 versus es 100 right
other<00:02:30.600> than<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.930> there's<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.230> lot<00:02:31.410> of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
other than that there's a lot of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.230 
other than that there's a lot of
functionalities<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> cameras<00:02:33.030> very

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
functionalities of the cameras very

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.840 
functionalities of the cameras very
similar<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.320> really<00:02:34.680> when<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.830> comes<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
similar but really when it comes to the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.660 
similar but really when it comes to the
quality<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.330> EXO<00:02:36.900> its<00:02:37.140> low-light<00:02:37.710> ability<00:02:38.520> its

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
quality of EXO its low-light ability its

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
quality of EXO its low-light ability its
dynamic<00:02:39.240> range<00:02:39.480> features<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:41.040> is

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
dynamic range features you know this is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.060 
dynamic range features you know this is
again<00:02:41.700> one<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> biggest<00:02:42.510> factors<00:02:43.080> there's

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
again one of the biggest factors there's

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.250 
again one of the biggest factors there's
some<00:02:44.280> differences<00:02:44.730> again<00:02:45.060> though<00:02:45.300> if<00:02:46.020> we<00:02:46.110> like

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
some differences again though if we like

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.870 
some differences again though if we like
a<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.770> back<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.250> camera<00:02:47.490> it's<00:02:47.820> a

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
a look at the back of the camera it's a

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.030 
a look at the back of the camera it's a
little<00:02:48.090> bit<00:02:48.180> larger<00:02:48.750> LCD<00:02:49.680> screen<00:02:49.920> that's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
little bit larger LCD screen that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.110 
little bit larger LCD screen that's
something<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.520> people<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.880> been<00:02:50.970> asking

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
something that people have been asking

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.540 
something that people have been asking
for<00:02:51.540> they<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> logic<00:02:52.260> LCD<00:02:52.710> screen<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
for they have a logic LCD screen on the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.080 
for they have a logic LCD screen on the
back<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.090> camera<00:02:54.800> well<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> love<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> s100

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
back of the camera well I love the s100

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.630 
back of the camera well I love the s100
so<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> S<00:02:57.750> 200<00:02:58.290> got<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> EXR<00:02:59.010> sensor<00:02:59.490> it's

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
so if the S 200 got the EXR sensor it's

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.820 
so if the S 200 got the EXR sensor it's
going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> be<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:00.330> better<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.410> can't

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
going to be that much better so I can't

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.530 
going to be that much better so I can't
wait<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.100> try<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.030> why<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.360> come

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
wait to try it so why don't you come

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.790 
wait to try it so why don't you come
back<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.750> join<00:03:04.140> us<00:03:04.320> we're<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> go

back and join us we're going to go

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.380 
back and join us we're going to go
through<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> first<00:03:05.400> look<00:03:05.610> video<00:03:05.820> where<00:03:06.180> Billy
