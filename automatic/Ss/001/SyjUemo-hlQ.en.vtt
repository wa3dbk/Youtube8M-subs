00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.520
 hello everyone today to me on i am you 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.039
 got iphone 4 with standard for it 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.210
 defect when the microphone does not work and 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.810
 speaker and the reason turns in audio 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.839
 codecs 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.429
 on the diagram is denoted as 62 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:30.539
 usually helps just roll to 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.840
 chip pinch replacing this 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.579
 phone after bounce 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.830
 I honestly first encountered 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.950
 so that it is from damage so much 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.200
 many pads 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.870
 of course I tried to restore it all about 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 water me 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 right now, I try to bring profit 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 I was visible to focus so there is 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.299
 one thought now i will try it all 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.240
 do and then take off the result 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.820
 how it will look like regret 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.689
 Once again, this is Kiev, become not 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.960
 turned out too thick not stand and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.960
 too many of them close to the door 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.289
 let's continue 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 so after almost two hours it turned out 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:40.180
 Here is such an origami from about hanks 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 chip stuck next free 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.530
 place super glue and jumpers 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.380
 restored to all contacts that 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.860
 were 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.759
 all current themselves who remained and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 pattern 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.170
 on all elements from which such already 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.539
 didn't come 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.570
 what happened as it is possible and not 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.979
 asking why is it so wide and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.470
 scatter wiring 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:16.670
 because although enameled but because 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.440
 the fact that he is this posting from the speaker 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.440
 due to the fact that the dynamics of glued 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.060
 and when you tear it sometimes varnish 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:35.600
 go around with glue it's not visible 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.750
 to protect against all these 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.190
 possible problems with the closure I decided 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.190
 throw so wide 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.840
 now in an ultrasonic bath to 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.240
 clear all residues 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.670
 not then varnish which hardens under 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:04.330
 ultraviolet light 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:13.540
 stick a little to the base and everything 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:17.490
 the actual result then show general 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.580
 turned repair silhouette I was planning 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.090
 put no guides to rule 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.540
 scored taxi ultraviolet Zelenko 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.470
 the phone works 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.010
 see if anyone is interested 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.850
 certainly not very aesthetically different otherwise 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.500
 it did not work out enough 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.130
 reliably that the chip is glued 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.980
 on super glue qe dress your back 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:51.390
 side and all the bus station then this varnish 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.140
 so it must be safe well of course 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.940
 fix something else but i think 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.490
 even goes to plant and on these sociis and 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.480
 Forex to work most 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.510
 subsequent repairs no one is all not 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 hurt someone else will be very big 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.680
 restoration work this construction 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.630
 the main thing is that everything turned out all thanks 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.900
 I hope for watching it was interesting 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.900
 bye everyone
