00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 now you have to be in the leader of 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.910
 all the things that have taken me from 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.970
 choice that is an online clothing store 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.920
 and accessories and I arrived yesterday 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.509
 and my sister was obsessed with 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.639
 skills at the moment because I wanted to see 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 that had arrived and I liked a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.699
 small discussion because she wanted that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.380
 I thought about it at the time but I wanted to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 wait in the video to open it 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.850
 here in front of you and so that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.119
 you see my first impression so nothing 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's open the bag and I remember 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.300
 some things that I asked but from other 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.380
 things I do not remember 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.329
 well I show you the bag and it is this and the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 transmits in a box but this time the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.610
 strength so 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 has everything in bags chiquitita 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 transparent and the first thing I see in the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.500
 top part is there I love that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.500
 more things is a jacket a shirt 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.610
 and it is a 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.260
 refines a thick shirt in military green 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.540
 I find beautiful and goes with everything if 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.860
 can use it for positivity 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.229
 surely consisting of sweater or 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.600
 because it is very thin and now in winter 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.310
 it's great and it's true military has 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.810
 here separate details the buttons 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.150
 golden 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.680
 and the fabric shows that it's fine I like it 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.570
 because it's thick and I can use it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.830
 now so it's this 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:37.220
 I find it very nice jolÃ­n kuwait 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.220
 the next thing I see around here is this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.150
 now let's tell my husband if 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.680
 you bought some pants pants 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.760
 cowboys because he likes levi's 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 because it's what's best for them 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.050
 then we saw I had a store maybe 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.760
 matisse and some sweatpants that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 he loved them and I did not want them to be 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.680
 shopping until I'm convention 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.240
 comic-con and I said yes then it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.010
 I buy them and I say games are 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 horrible I do not like them I do not know what good 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.330
 I already tell you , well, I like it if the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.850
 bought and then I ended up buying 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.170
 the same ones on the chase page and I 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.610
 realize that they have to lizarra 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.290
 I also do not know at what price but the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.209
 we have super similar in hectare and it is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.250
 that I wanted I do not know I'm tending to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.860
 things get things a little clothes 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.410
 more comfortable and I wanted something that comfortable but 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.630
 also pretty so I ordered these 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.400
 pants to see if it looks really good that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.530
 they are as if they were sweat suits and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.250
 so now he does remove his tracksuit and 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.140
 They are gray 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.230
 from behind they are black 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.510
 and then tubed mariah or more 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.140
 small at the bottom and this is 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.350
 size 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.050
 I hope it's the sane system 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.740
 without insurance screen because it's that 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.840
 it was between ms and nothing that program did not 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.660
 it stays well but I love it and it has 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.950
 the brown laces so I think 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.390
 that looks great for a day that he wants 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.010
 say that you do not have to go 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.320
 she is always super dressed that exceeds 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.070
 ruled it seems to me that one day to go comfortable 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.330
 and pretty, it's fine and I need 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.770
 a lot of that kind of clothes because what 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.500
 only we have in clothing programs 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.810
 and I love to be comfortable especially 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.740
 that this is great in the next one 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.740
 bought is 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 good are these pants that 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.250
 they have the whole world that has created them 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.930
 that will be analyzed first by the first 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.760
 known of who they were but that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.430
 they had black and white my sister 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.410
 he loves it and I asked you in navy blue 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.540
 so you see I do not remember if I do not 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.880
 I agreed if those of the blacks but we are going to 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.470
 these are also pretty and they are those that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.600
 they are how they are called score dhs in English 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.250
 trousers that are pants by 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.380
 behind but then they have this 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.470
 asymmetrical and it looks like it's a skirt 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.660
 short so let's see how it looks and 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.260
 I hope it's not too big this is already a 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.239
 a little bit of time to try 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.239
 and this having this side 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.600
 in English despite the thick ones and that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.600
 you can put winter 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.800
 and I think it's to send all 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.290
 to do them so I do not like the 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.139
 following 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.959
 yes 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.819
 I'm say something to emerge six or one 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.939
 sweatshirt because I want like I said go 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.770
 comfortable then I wanted another sweater 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.199
 because I have one of pictures and I like it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.759
 a lot and I chose this one that I love but 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.150
 it's not white I wanted it to be soft but 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.969
 is beige and then this one that has the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.520
 white collar then has the rest 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.870
 everything as you see the bottom is 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.539
 white and is feeding the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.159
 zippers on the sides in gold like this 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.590
 which is great and it seems to me that 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.590
 stayed perfect good to this m 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.189
 there 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:00.160
 but I think it's super nice 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.020
 I love it and then I have two more things 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.180
 what are these two things that are two 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.220
 Basic t-shirts because not 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.890
 we had the basic t-shirts of 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.510
 long-sleeved winter but many of 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.150
 short sleeve to find gifts 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.870
 but it did not have long shape so I picked 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.310
 these two that are simple and 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.390
 only 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.340
 normal you're white and it's long sleeves 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.570
 has like in the man part a 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.490
 little fall and it 's like that long sleeve is what 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.030
 big enough and does not size 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.419
 blank and I have taken and I have taken the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.419
 same 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.950
 not being in the same krieger 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:52.190
 cozy same good I have caught this that 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.430
 is black with shoulder pads are supposed to be 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.920
 of skin but they are really plastic and 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.960
 then it is very fine and almost 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.270
 transparent but if the shirt is 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.120
 It's nice that I do not like to wear 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.940
 shirts below 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.550
 alphabet from afar 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.500
 I like it, but I'm going to have 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.300
 have to put something under so I can get 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.070
 and has the label very similar to 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.620
 the tarot labels and once it 's 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.230
 and he already thought that he had asked me 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.760
 another shirt is in black but so 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.750
 you see I did not say goodbye where I have not 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.270
 asked for the other but the fabric of this 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.490
 same is great does not look very thin and very 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.310
 transparent and has a look has this 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.930
 open open to the sides a bit like that 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.699
 what is cool 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.340
 and nothing those are all the things that I 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.720
 I bought the truth is that I did not 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.650
 I already remembered the things that had 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.240
 order 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.100
 I leave the links of all things in 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.289
 the information box and also you 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.030
 I leave the link of the website in case 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:53.610
 you want to go see there are a lot of things 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.979
 beautiful I also like jewelry or 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.080
 the jewels the necklaces they have and 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.389
 they also have accessories and they have 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.740
 shoes a lot of things but this time 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.630
 I would say all of Europe because our 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.949
 It was long - sleeved clothing manga lists 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.660
 Long for winter is among the 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.190
 pants that was a whim and already 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.050
 I hope that the video is based and 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.820
