00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.220
 sorry after what it was 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 the previous chapter I imagine that equal 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.849
 that I will have needed time to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.769
 digest it calmly in the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.570
 today's chapter we'll see how to put it in 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.190
 practice so that you get the best 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.190
 high speed photos do not miss it 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.060
 we are in jiménez de jamuz leon españa 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.400
 here begins an interesting route 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.199
 ornithological of several days I leave you all 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.710
 the information in the description of 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.989
 video the route located in an area of 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.309
 Special protection for birds 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.339
 takes place between wetlands and 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.339
 culture 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.280
 here you can photograph eaglet 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.280
 ashen 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.710
 bustard 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.950
 heron 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.950
 or egret among many other species 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.509
 we have set up a high stage 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.930
 speed with a basic outline of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.570
 illumination 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.980
 here we have placed a pre-innkeeper and 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.440
 here the innkeeper where we want 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.850
 photographing the bird at the same time 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.530
 this travel 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.190
 here we have put the cell 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.170
 photoelectric 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.810
 how the system has a little bit of 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 delay we place it approximately to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.730
 a span of our innkeeper of such 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 way that the photo would do here and here 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.020
 is where the bird would go to eat the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.900
 barrier can not be attached to the bird 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 because then it was not going to work and there's 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.160
 to give a few centimeters away 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.130
 we have illuminated this with a couple of 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.320
 flashes that are as you can see at 45 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.480
 degrees of where we are going to do 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.610
 the photo and in the background 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.519
 we have placed another flash so that what 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.580
 illuminate the distance approximately 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.830
 between one and a half and two meters the camera 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.049
 we have placed it here and with a goal 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.000
 about 150 millimeters it would have to be 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.739
 put it about 10 meters from the bottom each 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 letter corresponds to a group of flash in 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.360
 this case we have only placed a flash 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.730
 in each of the groups a and b are the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.220
 flashes that will give light to the bird 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 that we had at 45 degrees while c 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.299
 it would be the flash that will illuminate us 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.709
 background as we only have one in the background 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.670
 we are going to put a power on him a little bit 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.120
 more higher than it would be 18 and those of 45 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.799
 degrees we're going to put them to 16 then 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.440
 we do not have to go to the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.560
 flashes will change the powers 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.099
 just from here remotely what 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.099
 we can do 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.290
 we would put 116 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.989
 and as you can see we already have the powers 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.530
 changed if we put our flash to 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.530
 maximum power 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.579
 we can see that the flash is very 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.930
 great but if we put a 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.510
 lower power 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.950
 the flash is almost imperceptible with what 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.959
 what the annoyance that we are going to cause to 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.790
 the birds will be minimal as with high 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.920
 speed we're just going to be able to make a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.950
 picture in conditions what we are going to do 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.379
 is 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.379
 put our shot in a single photo 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.580
 a rain cover like this matins 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.810
 protect our camera and will make it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.810
 go unnoticed 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.730
 We are trying our scenario 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.770
 high speed and we've seen with 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.410
 coalfish has come here and instead 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.540
 to jump to this part of the innkeeper who 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.150
 is where we wanted to have 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.400
 posed here then to avoid this he 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.100
 we are going to put a little network of 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.230
 camouflage that as we explained in the 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.180
 chapter number 6 of feeders in 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.920
 our bird photography course 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.920
 It will be quite unpleasant 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.270
 the birds are unpredictable and although the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.010
 we have everything perfectly assembled to 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.280
 times they will enter where least 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.280
 let's hope 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.030
 the main project is the main 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.680
 aim to promote tourism 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.719
 ornithological in the community of castilla 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.039
 and León 'Spain we would like to give you the 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.900
 thanks for the large amount of 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.849
 thank you comments arrived 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.680
 from all parts of the world if you 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.150
 he liked you do not forget to share it in 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.150
