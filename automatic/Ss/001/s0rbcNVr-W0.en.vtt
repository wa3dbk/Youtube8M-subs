to<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:24.090> peak<00:00:24.359> efficiency<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.260> reliability<00:00:25.849> so

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to be peak efficiency and reliability so

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.099 
to be peak efficiency and reliability so
we're<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.240> ahead<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.689> started

fire it and set the efficiency okay when
we<00:01:54.640> go<00:01:54.759> to<00:01:54.819> test<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.240> furnace<00:01:55.509> we're<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:55.750> to

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
we go to test the furnace we're going to

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.350 
we go to test the furnace we're going to
use<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.929> bat<00:01:56.229> rack<00:01:56.759> tester<00:01:57.759> it's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.240> mini

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
use a bat rack tester it's a little mini

use a bat rack tester it's a little mini
computer<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:58.929> will<00:01:58.990> set<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.289> our<00:01:59.380> furnace

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
computer it will set up our furnace
