customer customer I mean Custer is

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.699 
customer customer I mean Custer is
outstanding<00:03:38.360> player<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.410> know<00:03:39.500> that

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
outstanding player and you know that

last<00:03:42.800> game<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:43.490> I<00:03:43.730> think<00:03:45.040> keeping<00:03:46.040> her<00:03:46.370> touches

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
last game so I think keeping her touches

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.640 
last game so I think keeping her touches
to<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> minimum<00:03:47.570> force<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.080> other<00:03:48.170> people<00:03:48.560> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170 
to a minimum force to other people to
shoot<00:03:48.830> shots<00:03:49.130> they<00:03:49.310> didn't<00:03:49.550> necessarily<00:03:49.730> want

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
shoot shots they didn't necessarily want

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.900 
shoot shots they didn't necessarily want
to<00:03:50.270> shoot<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:51.590> think<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.220> was<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> big<00:03:52.670> key

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
to shoot and I think that was a big key

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.940 
to shoot and I think that was a big key
I<00:03:52.940> think<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.600> think<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.410> don't<00:03:54.620> think<00:03:54.800> you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
I think I think I don't think you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.640 
I think I think I don't think you
stopped<00:03:55.340> her<00:03:55.610> 101<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.480> think<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.140> stopped<00:03:57.440> her

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
stopped her 101 I think you stopped her

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.620 
stopped her 101 I think you stopped her
by<00:03:57.800> great<00:03:58.100> team<00:03:58.430> defense<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.239> think<00:03:59.450> that's

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
by great team defense and I think that's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:13.229 
by great team defense and I think that's
what<00:03:59.750> we<00:03:59.780> did<00:03:59.989> today<00:04:10.959> well<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> mean<00:04:12.380> she's<00:04:12.680> just

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
getting this team into it's a different

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.200 
getting this team into it's a different
team<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.110> it's<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.290> team<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.610> point<00:04:40.910> guards

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
team and it's a team of the point guards

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.570 
team and it's a team of the point guards
got<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.540> understand<00:04:41.960> what<00:04:42.830> they<00:04:43.010> like<00:04:43.280> where

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
got to understand what they like where

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.840 
got to understand what they like where
they<00:04:43.729> like<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.890> in<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.070> timing<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.760> all

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
they like it and in the timing of it all

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.900 
they like it and in the timing of it all
and<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.800> little<00:04:48.979> mistake<00:04:49.400> she's<00:04:49.700> making

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
and so the little mistake she's making

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.640 
and so the little mistake she's making
right<00:04:50.240> now<00:04:50.270> aren't<00:04:50.630> necessarily<00:04:51.110> just<00:04:51.380> her

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
right now aren't necessarily just her

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.710 
right now aren't necessarily just her
it's<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.669> other<00:04:52.880> people<00:04:53.270> not<00:04:53.419> maybe

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
it's it's the other people not maybe

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.780 
it's it's the other people not maybe
understanding<00:04:54.440> where<00:04:55.040> they<00:04:55.220> need<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.460> be<00:04:55.580> at

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
understanding where they need to be at

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.460 
understanding where they need to be at
the<00:04:55.820> proper<00:04:56.240> time<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:56.720> know<00:04:56.810> she<00:04:56.900> sees<00:04:57.320> the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
the proper time you know she sees the

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.230 
the proper time you know she sees the

ridiculous<00:05:19.660> how<00:05:19.840> hard<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:21.220> squeeze<00:05:21.460> in

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
ridiculous how hard it is to squeeze in

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.230 
ridiculous how hard it is to squeeze in

what is it Ryan 11 games 12 games 11

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.900 
what is it Ryan 11 games 12 games 11
games<00:05:25.630> into<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.380> very<00:05:26.770> short<00:05:27.130> window<00:05:27.340> when<00:05:27.760> it's

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
games into a very short window when it's

and so this is just going to happen like

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.490 
and so this is just going to happen like
that<00:05:32.590> i<00:05:32.800> don't<00:05:32.920> i<00:05:33.280> don't<00:05:33.340> really<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:33.730> it<00:05:34.500> but

hopefully<00:05:36.370> we<00:05:36.490> have<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.760> depth<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.150> survive

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
hopefully we have the depth to survive

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.220
