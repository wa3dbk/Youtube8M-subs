and it's really easy little chord change
jump<00:00:52.580> to<00:00:52.700> make<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:53.030> piano<00:00:53.360> kind<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.720> going<00:00:53.900> from

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
jump to make on piano kind of going from

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.320 
jump to make on piano kind of going from
an<00:00:54.140> a<00:00:54.230> minor<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.590> a<00:00:54.650> D<00:00:54.830> minor<00:00:55.040> on<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:55.340> guitar<00:00:56.030> it

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
an a minor to a D minor on a guitar it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.549 
an a minor to a D minor on a guitar it
lends<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.630> so<00:00:56.720> this<00:00:56.930> lends<00:00:57.170> itself<00:00:57.410> really

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
lends it so this lends itself really

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.290 
lends it so this lends itself really
well<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.340> guitar<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.000> what<00:00:59.150> I've<00:00:59.210> done

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
well to the guitar and so what I've done

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.970 
well to the guitar and so what I've done
is<00:00:59.449> put<00:00:59.480> together<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.930> lesson<00:01:00.320> on<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.710> at

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
is put together a lesson on this at

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.950 
is put together a lesson on this at
totally<00:01:01.340> guitars<00:01:01.670> it's<00:01:02.270> part<00:01:02.480> of<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.600> target

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
totally guitars it's part of the target

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.100 
totally guitars it's part of the target
program<00:01:03.350> there<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.250> what<00:01:05.180> what<00:01:05.690> we<00:01:05.720> kind<00:01:05.960> of

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
program there and what what we kind of

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.650 
program there and what what we kind of
cover<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:06.950> mostly<00:01:07.940> chord

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
cover in this is mostly chord

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.270 
cover in this is mostly chord
progression<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.080> pretty<00:01:09.229> simple<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.710> bunch

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
progression is pretty simple so a bunch

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.859 
progression is pretty simple so a bunch
of<00:01:10.369> normal<00:01:10.550> chords<00:01:10.940> in<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.090> key<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.510> minor

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
of normal chords in the key of a minor

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.080 
of normal chords in the key of a minor
but<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.560> interesting<00:01:13.160> thing<00:01:13.220> about<00:01:13.580> the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
but the interesting thing about the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.150 
but the interesting thing about the
lesson<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.690> why<00:01:15.050> it's<00:01:15.259> an<00:01:15.350> important<00:01:15.740> song<00:01:15.950> to

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
lesson and why it's an important song to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.550 
lesson and why it's an important song to
learn<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.520> we<00:01:17.300> really<00:01:17.570> address<00:01:17.780> playing<00:01:18.259> in

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
learn is we really address playing in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.590 
learn is we really address playing in
strumming<00:01:19.310> accompaniment<00:01:19.729> patterns<00:01:20.270> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
strumming accompaniment patterns and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.420 
strumming accompaniment patterns and
even<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.840> few<00:01:20.990> our<00:01:21.110> pedos<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.800> twelve<00:01:22.190> eight

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
even a few our pedos in twelve eight

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.760 
even a few our pedos in twelve eight
time<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.479> it's<00:01:23.660> where<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.320> have<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.590> take

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
time so it's where you have to take

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.600 
time so it's where you have to take
beats<00:01:25.220> slow<00:01:25.880> moving<00:01:26.240> beats<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:27.610> splitting

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
beats slow moving beats and splitting

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.490 
beats slow moving beats and splitting
them<00:01:28.790> into<00:01:28.880> thirds

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.410 

so<00:01:33.500> there's<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> whole<00:01:33.860> long<00:01:34.090> bunch<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.180> parts

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
so there's a whole long bunch of parts

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.999 
so there's a whole long bunch of parts
to<00:01:35.479> this<00:01:35.660> lesson<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.229> that's<00:01:36.500> generally<00:01:36.890> what

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
to this lesson and that's generally what

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.440 
to this lesson and that's generally what
it<00:01:37.130> breaks<00:01:37.399> down<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.789> goes<00:01:37.940> into<00:01:38.119> is

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
it breaks down and goes into is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.290 
it breaks down and goes into is
strumming<00:01:39.410> in<00:01:39.770> twelve<00:01:40.310> eight<00:01:40.460> time<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.000> then

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
strumming in twelve eight time and then

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.580 
strumming in twelve eight time and then
of<00:01:41.330> course<00:01:41.420> we<00:01:41.690> learn<00:01:42.020> how<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.200> play<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
of course we learn how to play the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.740 
of course we learn how to play the
chords<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.950> ballad<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.880> with<00:01:44.000> in<00:01:44.119> man<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.509> sub

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
chords to ballad it with in man to sub

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.809 
chords to ballad it with in man to sub
to<00:01:44.780> really<00:01:45.319> just<00:01:45.530> two<00:01:45.740> parts<00:01:46.039> will<00:01:46.190> an<00:01:46.429> intro

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
to really just two parts will an intro

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.749 
to really just two parts will an intro
and<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.240> verse<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.660> then<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.679> little<00:01:49.310> bridge<00:01:49.490> it

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
and a verse and then a little bridge it

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.880 
and a verse and then a little bridge it
is<00:01:49.789> much<00:01:50.390> easier<00:01:50.660> than<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.899> intro<00:01:51.200> though

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
is much easier than the intro though

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.160 
is much easier than the intro though
coolest<00:01:52.759> stuff<00:01:52.910> is<00:01:53.030> in<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.209> intro<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.690> so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
coolest stuff is in the intro to this so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.740 
coolest stuff is in the intro to this so
if<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.500> wanna<00:01:54.619> get<00:01:54.770> started<00:01:54.830> on<00:01:55.190> C<00:01:56.179> R<00:01:56.209> it<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.450> a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
if you wanna get started on C R it is a

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.660 
if you wanna get started on C R it is a
minor<00:01:57.530> chord<00:01:57.770> he<00:01:57.979> doesn't<00:01:58.280> capable<00:01:58.520> at<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
minor chord he doesn't capable at the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.949 
minor chord he doesn't capable at the
second<00:01:58.970> fret<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.270> end<00:01:59.420> up<00:01:59.479> doing<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.810> lesson
