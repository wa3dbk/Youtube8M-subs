00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
these shapes in different ways so they

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.930 
these shapes in different ways so they
will<00:01:45.690> give<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.229> illusion<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.950> curves<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.670> the

rectangle body shape because it's so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.770 
rectangle body shape because it's so

v-shape necklines are very complementary

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.449

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
because they will show off a little bit

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.879 
because they will show off a little bit
of<00:04:18.519> skin<00:04:18.850> without<00:04:19.030> showing<00:04:19.540> off<00:04:19.690> too<00:04:20.109> much<00:04:20.320> so

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
of skin without showing off too much so

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.290 
of skin without showing off too much so
I've<00:04:21.040> spoken<00:04:21.250> about<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.700> v-shaped<00:04:22.090> neckline

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300

plenty<00:04:22.930> of<00:04:23.020> times<00:04:23.230> before<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.919> like<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.460> said

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
plenty of times before and like I said

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.340 
plenty of times before and like I said
it<00:04:24.760> breaks<00:04:25.030> up<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.300> chest<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:25.990> we'll<00:04:26.139> also

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350
