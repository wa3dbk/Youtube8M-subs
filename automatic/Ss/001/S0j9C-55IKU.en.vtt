relaxed and then if it comes to my

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.190 
relaxed and then if it comes to my
backhand<00:01:42.549> I<00:01:43.000> can<00:01:43.509> buy<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.840> tip<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.140> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
backhand I can buy the tip of the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.749 
backhand I can buy the tip of the
rackets<00:01:44.560> here<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.950> easily<00:01:45.189> just<00:01:45.400> make<00:01:45.729> a

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
rackets here I can easily just make a

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.609 
rackets here I can easily just make a
first<00:01:46.090> move<00:01:46.210> like<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.140> moral<00:01:50.409> of<00:01:50.560> the

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
first move like that so the moral of the

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.429 
first move like that so the moral of the
story<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:52.180> way<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.750> start<00:01:53.140> in

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
story is that the way that you start in

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.410 
story is that the way that you start in
your<00:01:53.560> ready<00:01:53.770> position<00:01:53.880> makes<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.030> huge

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
your ready position makes a huge

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.660 
your ready position makes a huge
difference<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.110> how<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.070> can<00:01:57.369> make<00:01:57.549> an

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
difference on how you can make an

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.819 
difference on how you can make an
effective<00:01:58.150> first<00:01:58.479> move<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.049> ball<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.740> if

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
effective first move to the ball so if

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.289 
effective first move to the ball so if
you're<00:01:59.950> not<00:02:00.130> doing<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.610> already<00:02:00.850> I
