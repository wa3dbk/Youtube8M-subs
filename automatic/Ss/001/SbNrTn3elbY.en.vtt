of<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.840> not

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
of a use now because now it's really not

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.799 
of a use now because now it's really not
necessary<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.809> get

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
necessary for you to go to it to get

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
necessary for you to go to it to get
anything<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.520> biome<00:01:02.520> code<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:02.910> be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
anything really biome code will be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.609 
anything really biome code will be
finished<00:01:03.420> along<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.019> new<00:01:04.170> biomes<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
finished along with two new biomes of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
finished along with two new biomes of
snowy<00:01:04.890> biome<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> mushroom<00:01:05.850> biome<00:01:06.140> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
snowy biome in the mushroom biome so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
snowy biome in the mushroom biome so
biome<00:01:07.409> code<00:01:07.590> being<00:01:07.799> finished<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.580> good<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
biome code being finished is good and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
biome code being finished is good and
the<00:01:09.570> snowy<00:01:09.780> biome<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.290> coming<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.040> didn't

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the snowy biome is coming back it didn't

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
the snowy biome is coming back it didn't
it's<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> 1.8<00:01:12.420> Update<00:01:12.510> because

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's not in the 1.8 Update because

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.660 
it's not in the 1.8 Update because
there's<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.380> sort<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> bug<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
there's like some sort of bug then the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
there's like some sort of bug then the
mushroom<00:01:15.060> biome<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> gonna<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.630> interesting<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
mushroom biome is gonna be interesting I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.969 
mushroom biome is gonna be interesting I
guess<00:01:16.049> they're<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> lot<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
guess they're just gonna be a lot of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.910 
guess they're just gonna be a lot of
mushrooms<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.560> how<00:01:19.710> that's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
mushrooms and so I don't know how that's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
mushrooms and so I don't know how that's
going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> work<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> be

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
going to work but that's going to be

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
going to work but that's going to be
interesting<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.350> sure<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.180> they<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.270> now

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
interesting for sure and they will now

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
interesting for sure and they will now
be<00:01:24.570> naturally<00:01:25.439> created<00:01:25.770> huge<00:01:26.040> mushrooms<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
be naturally created huge mushrooms so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.190 
be naturally created huge mushrooms so
huge<00:01:27.240> mushrooms<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.810> create<00:01:27.930> am<00:01:28.049> now

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
huge mushrooms you can create am now

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
huge mushrooms you can create am now
with<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.759> with<00:01:29.759> bone<00:01:30.000> meal<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> normal

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
with a with bone meal and a normal

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.060 
with a with bone meal and a normal
mushroom<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.740> hit<00:01:31.979> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
with the bone meal and it'll grow this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
with the bone meal and it'll grow this
giant<00:01:34.860> mushroom<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.460> cool<00:01:35.670> but

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
giant mushroom which is pretty cool but

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
giant mushroom which is pretty cool but
now<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.479> naturally<00:01:36.659> spawned<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
now these will naturally spawned so I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
now these will naturally spawned so I
guess<00:01:37.829> these<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.280> being<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> mushroom

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
guess these a bit being the mushroom

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.840 
guess these a bit being the mushroom
biome<00:01:39.060> switch<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.540> cool<00:01:40.229> full<00:01:40.619> show<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> then

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
biome switch is cool full show and then

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.139 
biome switch is cool full show and then
the<00:01:41.970> new<00:01:42.150> mob<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> mush<00:01:43.430> mooshroom<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the new mob the mush mooshroom like a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
the new mob the mush mooshroom like a
cat<00:01:45.600> cow<00:01:46.020> moo<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> mushroom<00:01:47.790> cow

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
cat cow moo it is a mushroom cow

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
cat cow moo it is a mushroom cow
probably<00:01:48.479> found<00:01:48.600> roaming<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.049> mushroom

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
probably found roaming in the mushroom

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.760 
probably found roaming in the mushroom
biome<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.729> guess<00:01:51.329> they're<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.780> notch

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
biome and I guess they're very notch

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
biome and I guess they're very notch
seems<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.220> very<00:01:53.250> involved<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.420> mushrooms

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
seems to be very involved with mushrooms

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
seems to be very involved with mushrooms
i<00:01:55.020> guess<00:01:55.200> i<00:01:55.320> don't<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.619> i<00:01:55.860> personally

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
i guess i don't know i personally

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.830 
i guess i don't know i personally
wouldn't<00:01:56.820> dedicate<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> whole<00:01:57.240> biome<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
wouldn't dedicate a whole biome to it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
wouldn't dedicate a whole biome to it
but<00:01:57.990> i'll<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.380> pretty<00:01:58.590> pretty<00:01:59.340> interesting

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
but i'll be pretty pretty interesting

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.719 
but i'll be pretty pretty interesting
how<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.969> works<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.710> now<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> new

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
how that works out now we have a new

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.840 
how that works out now we have a new
grass<00:02:03.030> block<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> volcanoes<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.850> volcanoes

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
grass block and volcanoes and volcanoes

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
grass block and volcanoes and volcanoes
maybe<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> new<00:02:07.439> grass<00:02:07.680> block<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.250> guess

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
maybe so the new grass block I guess

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.040 
maybe so the new grass block I guess
that's<00:02:08.610> pretty<00:02:08.879> cool<00:02:09.000> i<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.660> what

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's pretty cool i don't know how what

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.729 
that's pretty cool i don't know how what
that's<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.379> look<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.560> you're

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that's going to look like you're

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.830 
that's going to look like you're
anything<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.039> volcanoes<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:12.330> gets<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.660> go

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
anything but volcanoes he gets that go

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.870 
anything but volcanoes he gets that go
and<00:02:12.959> i'll<00:02:13.050> be<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.410> pumped

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and i'll be so pumped

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.270 
and i'll be so pumped
that's<00:02:14.150> gonna<00:02:14.270> be<00:02:14.360> awesome<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.830> super<00:02:16.160> excited

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
sounds of Endermen and solar fish so I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.610 
sounds of Endermen and solar fish so I
like<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.510> adding<00:02:32.810> new<00:02:32.930> sounds<00:02:33.320> because<00:02:33.470> the

like the adding new sounds because the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.600 
like the adding new sounds because the
Minecraft<00:02:33.980> definitely<00:02:34.280> need<00:02:34.370> some<00:02:34.490> more

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
Minecraft definitely need some more

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
man and silver fish will definitely be

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.510 
man and silver fish will definitely be
good<00:02:38.690> because<00:02:38.840> endermen<00:02:39.290> currently<00:02:40.010> has<00:02:40.130> just

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
good because endermen currently has just

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.520 
good because endermen currently has just
the<00:02:40.640> zombie<00:02:40.970> sounds<00:02:41.120> kind<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.570> stupid<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the zombie sounds kind of stupid so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.660 
the zombie sounds kind of stupid so
they're<00:02:42.710> also<00:02:42.830> going<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.040> change<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.460> rain

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
they're also going to change the rain

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.790 
they're also going to change the rain
sound<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.210> new<00:02:44.360> stamp<00:02:44.630> new<00:02:44.990> sounds<00:02:45.350> for<00:02:45.380> doors

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
sound and new stamp new sounds for doors

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.400 
sound and new stamp new sounds for doors
and<00:02:45.920> skeletons<00:02:46.700> skeletons<00:02:47.660> walk<00:02:47.930> will<00:02:48.170> now

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
and skeletons skeletons walk will now

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.980 
and skeletons skeletons walk will now
sound<00:02:48.710> more<00:02:48.890> skeletony<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.540> new<00:02:50.690> sounds<00:02:50.960> for

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
sound more skeletony so new sounds for

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.020 
sound more skeletony so new sounds for
doors<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.380> good<00:02:51.530> changing<00:02:52.430> race<00:02:52.610> at<00:02:52.760> range

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
doors is good changing race at range

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.030 
doors is good changing race at range
down<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.450> guess<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.870> can<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.110> cool<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
down I guess I can be cool and the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.320 
down I guess I can be cool and the
skeletons<00:02:55.460> walk<00:02:55.670> will<00:02:55.820> now<00:02:55.940> send<00:02:56.150> more

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
skeletons walk will now send more

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.270 
skeletons walk will now send more
skeletony<00:02:56.870> that's<00:02:57.320> definitely<00:02:57.590> definitely

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
skeletony that's definitely definitely

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.850 
skeletony that's definitely definitely
going<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.640> be<00:02:58.700> awesome<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.410> don't<00:03:00.410> personally

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
going to be awesome I don't personally

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.900 
going to be awesome I don't personally
will<00:03:01.100> see<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.190> problem<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:01.460> it<00:03:01.580> but<00:03:01.760> that'll

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
will see a problem with it but that'll

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.120 
will see a problem with it but that'll
be<00:03:02.000> pretty<00:03:02.120> sweet<00:03:02.590> NPCs<00:03:03.590> will<00:03:03.800> now<00:03:03.890> be<00:03:04.040> in

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
be pretty sweet NPCs will now be in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.460 
be pretty sweet NPCs will now be in
villages<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.810> can<00:03:05.930> already<00:03:06.110> find

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
villages so you can already find

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.380 
villages so you can already find
villages<00:03:06.710> but<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.130> guess<00:03:07.310> NPCs<00:03:07.940> will<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.300> have

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
villages but I guess NPCs will just have

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.580 
villages but I guess NPCs will just have
spawned<00:03:08.690> them<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.170> don't<00:03:09.290> know<00:03:09.350> how<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
spawned them and I don't know how the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.530 
spawned them and I don't know how the
end<00:03:09.920> npcs<00:03:10.520> will<00:03:10.670> work<00:03:10.850> if<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.300> trade

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
end npcs will work if you like trade

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.090 
end npcs will work if you like trade
with<00:03:11.660> them<00:03:11.750> if<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.020> just<00:03:12.170> kill<00:03:12.350> them<00:03:12.440> black

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
with them if you just kill them black

with them if you just kill them black
like<00:03:13.280> mobs<00:03:13.520> or<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.880> full<00:03:14.210> if<00:03:14.780> they<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.140> look

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
like mobs or a full if they just look

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
like mobs or a full if they just look
like<00:03:15.290> maybe<00:03:15.820> multiplayer<00:03:16.820> players<00:03:17.180> or

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
like maybe multiplayer players or

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.300 
like maybe multiplayer players or
something<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.020> I<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.190> know<00:03:19.280> if

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
something like that so I don't know if

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.340 
something like that so I don't know if
I'll<00:03:19.970> be<00:03:20.270> really<00:03:20.510> interesting<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.930> see<00:03:21.170> how

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
I'll be really interesting to see how

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.290 
I'll be really interesting to see how
that<00:03:21.620> all<00:03:21.890> works<00:03:22.160> out<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.640> now<00:03:23.000> we're<00:03:23.240> actually

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
that all works out so now we're actually

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.170 
that all works out so now we're actually
have<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> use<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.080> experience<00:03:24.970> so<00:03:25.970> that's<00:03:26.090> going

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
have a use of experience so that's going

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.550 
have a use of experience so that's going
to<00:03:26.240> finally<00:03:26.570> be<00:03:26.690> added<00:03:26.990> in<00:03:27.110> because<00:03:27.350> right<00:03:27.530> now

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
to finally be added in because right now

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.350 
to finally be added in because right now
experience<00:03:28.490> orbs<00:03:28.790> don't<00:03:29.000> actually<00:03:29.270> do

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
experience orbs don't actually do

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.200 
experience orbs don't actually do
anything<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.250> don't<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.790> how<00:03:31.970> they're

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
anything so I I don't know how they're

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.790 
anything so I I don't know how they're
going<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.360> use<00:03:32.420> experience<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.140> hope<00:03:33.320> hopefully

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
going to use experience I hope hopefully

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.470 
going to use experience I hope hopefully
doesn't<00:03:34.100> ruin<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.460> game<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:34.910> keeps<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.300> more

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
doesn't ruin the game but keeps it more

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.900 
doesn't ruin the game but keeps it more
fun<00:03:35.770> because<00:03:36.770> minecraft<00:03:37.370> really<00:03:37.580> isn't<00:03:37.820> much

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910

but<00:03:38.090> experience<00:03:38.570> game<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.870> think<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.200> could

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
but experience game but I think it could

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.420 
but experience game but I think it could
maybe<00:03:40.520> help<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.240> some<00:03:41.510> cool<00:03:41.900> way<00:03:42.430> animal

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430

out<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.660> boss<00:04:23.840> mobs<00:04:24.110> is<00:04:25.070> also<00:04:25.310> have<00:04:25.490> an

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
out the boss mobs is also have an

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.590 
out the boss mobs is also have an
improved<00:04:25.970> /<00:04:26.390> new<00:04:26.660> armor

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
improved / new armor

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.680 
improved / new armor
so<00:04:28.380> that's<00:04:28.560> pretty<00:04:28.920> awesome<00:04:29.120> because<00:04:30.120> armor<00:04:30.540> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
so that's pretty awesome because armor I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.230 
so that's pretty awesome because armor I
think<00:04:30.870> kind<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.050> needs<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.320> up<00:04:31.740> upgrade<00:04:32.610> like

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
think kind of needs a up upgrade like

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.290 
think kind of needs a up upgrade like
food<00:04:33.750> got<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.400> I'm<00:04:35.460> pretty<00:04:35.640> pretty<00:04:36.000> stoked

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
could we get increased armor durability

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.220 
could we get increased armor durability
this<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.270> hope<00:04:48.510> this<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.750> necessarily<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.110> good

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
this I hope this is necessarily a good

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.630 
this I hope this is necessarily a good
thing<00:04:49.290> I<00:04:49.500> guess<00:04:49.680> it'll<00:04:49.860> go<00:04:50.040> along<00:04:50.310> with<00:04:50.490> the

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
thing I guess it'll go along with the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.060 
thing I guess it'll go along with the
new<00:04:50.790> armor<00:04:51.090> system<00:04:51.480> so<00:04:51.690> we'll<00:04:51.870> see<00:04:52.110> they<00:04:52.920> kind

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
new armor system so we'll see they kind

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.140 
new armor system so we'll see they kind
of<00:04:53.100> balance<00:04:53.400> each<00:04:53.490> other<00:04:53.550> out<00:04:53.700> because<00:04:53.970> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
of balance each other out because I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.470 
of balance each other out because I
think<00:04:54.450> minecraft<00:04:55.260> is<00:04:55.380> harder<00:04:55.740> now<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:55.920> with<00:04:56.400> a

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
think minecraft is harder now and with a

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.940 
think minecraft is harder now and with a
more<00:04:57.480> armored<00:04:57.810> durability<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.410> mole<00:04:58.800> and

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
more armored durability that mole and

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.980 
more armored durability that mole and
make<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.190> easier<00:04:59.520> so<00:04:59.910> hopefully<00:05:00.330> it'll<00:05:00.750> keep

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
make it easier so hopefully it'll keep

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.810 
make it easier so hopefully it'll keep
it<00:05:01.170> at<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.320> same<00:05:01.530> hardness<00:05:02.220> level<00:05:02.400> because

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
it at the same hardness level because

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.550 
it at the same hardness level because
minecraft<00:05:03.810> needs<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.020> be<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.140> little<00:05:04.290> harder

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
minecraft needs to be a little harder

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.920 
minecraft needs to be a little harder
