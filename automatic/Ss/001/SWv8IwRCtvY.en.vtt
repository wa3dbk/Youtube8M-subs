00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.890
 you're cycling and looking for a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.870
 solution to transport your dog this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.480
 What I propose is the cart 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070
 for bike will be very convenient if your 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.460
 dog is old and has trouble getting 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.049
 move 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.849
 but also if you have several 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.890
 dogs it allows you to carry them 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.570
 very easily I explained to you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 now how does it work anymore in 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 detail in case of rain there is a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.700
 plastic protection that allows 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.700
 keep your dog safe 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.630
 to fix your dog in the cayolle 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 just use a couple as 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.320
 those there that contains two carabiners the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 first word what your are you going 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 hang it on the probe here 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.310
 and second us cotton warner necklace 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.370
 of your dog there are several 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.620
 da sizes torque as available 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.810
 on the possible this cayol allows for 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.130
 receive all the dog templates that 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740
 be the little ones as she did 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.290
 but also the biggest ones like 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.220
 saint bernard labradors really 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.840
 all dogs sell in this 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.720
 career and so with elfi we will go 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.229
 take a bike ride for the lfi 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.229
 up 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.200
 and so we have 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.610
 here nets that allow dogs 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.950
 to see what's going on outside and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 which helps to reassure or who sees it 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.330
 well the environment in which they 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.230
 evolve they can also benefit 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.230
 of the ride 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.640
 which it includes a spring that 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.850
 allows in turns to facilitate the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 maneuver 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.310
 and the cart for bennoo allows 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.710
 also to receive more dogs 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.750
 big size like here harper who was 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.820

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.820
