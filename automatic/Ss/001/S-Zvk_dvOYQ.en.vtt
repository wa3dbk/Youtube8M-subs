00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 others played their last this afternoon 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 2012 competition was the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.440
 assignment for the troops of dennis from 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.360
 neighborhood because otherwise dress to lose on the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.519
 in touch with the top of the rankings 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.780
 antwerps is shared seventh the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.790
 opponent this afternoon 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.199
 concord aalst state old but has 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.340
 strong the ice 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.020
 reputation and pressure must match this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.359
 win and have to do without being 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 so Captain Charles has been suspended 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.140
 the first due to danger comes roma four 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.320
 minutes but it is for the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320
 home team 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.260
 in the initial phase it opens up 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.870
 stairs of Judaism 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
 none of the growth dead can reach it 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.590
 then the competition collapsed and it is long 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.820
 waiting for opportunities but the opportunities out there 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.289
 are surprised by a zero 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.000
 lucky for design being the wave 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370
 rejected because the ball was already over 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.170
 been line 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 Antwerp has been warned on the stroke of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 peace is re almost there 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.199
 although the ball gets off the line 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.059
 resting position in aalst 100 and allowed there 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.440
 especially the visiting team is happy with it 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.760
 to be 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the second half it is again the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.510
 home team who first right in such 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 grabs 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 creating opportunities and antwerp it is already going 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 not a good season together beetle 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.369
 and tries with a shot from the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.350
 emergency holes the ball may not be quite right 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.850
 check but there is a goal 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 not in 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 after 68 minutes it becomes zero 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.100
 sense vulture has no chance at the header of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100
 something fantastic 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.070
 based on the odds is the lead 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.899
 deserves mercy for harmony 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 two minutes later another almost gets it 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.460
 completely lid on the nose 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.170
 see you get in between well 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.479
 and visitors become at least one point and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.789
 put everything on everything in the 85th minute 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.959
 the substitute bruno carvalho takes care of 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.420
 the redemption in this is to lead lead 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.549
 but the visitors are the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.049
 lost pedals the organization is far too far 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.119
 we are already looking for additional information 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.170
 time answer the ball does not get away 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.170
 been two one 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.170
 stand roz group recently became second 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.299
 from the afternoon impression to book all the way 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.680
 tool for his former team 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.209
 the average leaves everything without points 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.560
 also for antwerp we get the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.030
 stand there 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.250
 antennen exists on the shared seventh 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 place with Sint-Truiden tubeke 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.630
 and clutter design it must be at four even 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.700
 go later but as you see there are 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.510
 few points difference between the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.459
 places 5 and 11 in the battle for the 2nd 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.430
 period title does not answer 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.440
 it is only five tenths there and me 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.110
 reason for our last competition 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.560
 2012 so don't win 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.040
 here come the responses yes how can you 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
 saying it is natural we will be true 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.400
 I'm not good I'm really not feeling well 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.880
 I think it 's real 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.920
 they can't do it well and then you grab it 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.780
 with the fortunately still point 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.240
 but then ok yes then what then 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.250
 happens nobody knew 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.990
 what what what organization nobody knew 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.640
 we must now we must already have it 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.540
 should take initiative but if you like 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.960
 you just at the end of the match 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.670
 one comes here you play your organization 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.740
 distributors and trot but you have to go for the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 point can and it is all 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.040
 attackers then you still have to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.840
 organization oven and be happy that you are on 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.610
 the mind mouse but this is really crazy 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.200
 for words to become real we have to 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.760
 basically every three points 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.470
 but of course you have to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.680
 quality we have to competitions 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.120
 We can now dominate them 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.470
 seven played your fat cells said I can 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.390
 I don't really remember that we were one 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.740
 competition were really stronger than the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.390
 opponents 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.500
 we have roughly the same matches 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.500
 just as floras alike 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.220
 we can't hold a head start 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.330
 keep our high score finals 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.920
 and we kept very few zero 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.450
 so then i think you are about 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.750
 is where you belong 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.750
 to stand
