00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.260
 Alexey highlight frags restaurant sat 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.929
 like many from traditional Russians 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.530
 culinary plots and now i see this 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.440
 some potential and i want 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.020
 set up this story with 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.420
 classic tastes of some kind 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.790
 modern more lively more relevant 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
 coins of course we have dishes 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.530
 Russian cuisine actually the whole kitchen 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.980
 which we have that in a cafe stew that in 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.780
 tsdl 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.970
 in general can be called Russian 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.960
 because in my kitchen at least on 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.120
 attention is 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.910
 a combination of a culture of economics and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.820
 politicians here is a general state of mind 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.140
 societies today and turn 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.010
 man who is a state of mind 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.410
 transfer to culinary technology 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.140
 and combinations of products and their not thought that 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.480
 Russian cuisine is very small meat dishes that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.670
 what is wrong since we have meat 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.280
 there is generally a form of appeal itself 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.479
 also people think that to Russian cuisine 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.440
 very fat 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 which is decidedly wrong because images 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.880
 this kitchen was created in a country in which 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.580
 more than half a year after days and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.009
 the third misconception that Russian cuisine is from 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.440
 terribly old-fashioned and she found on 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.690
 presenting a dead end that is also completely not 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.119
 so since there everything is there again for 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.860
 development can not be said that the Russian 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.659
 kitchens are gaining popularity 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.179
 it was always associated with the natural 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.759
 state of mind of a man friends that she 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.550
 last trace you have to work on 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.229
 the laws of fashion never with this law 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.960
 rain or instead there should be 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.340
 offer something new to the public 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.159
 interesting amazing to 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.939
 to compete without you 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.240
 behind others 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.259
 kitchen methods and call that too 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.259
 curious to take 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.020
 Russian cuisine is very complex very 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.939
 thin very delicate salty alliance 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.369
 sweet and sour 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:09.239
 it is primarily cabbage kvass is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:14.940
 root crops in their various forms of 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.810
 celery to beets and Russian cuisine is 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.540
 very long process and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.670
 of all the languor that we 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.670
 cooks want to shorten to 10 minutes
