it was and it was just a side scroller I
was<00:01:00.059> testing<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.690> how<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> make

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
was testing out how it would be to make

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.450 
was testing out how it would be to make
a<00:01:01.739> side<00:01:02.039> scroller<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:02.910> what's<00:01:03.809> cool<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.460> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
a side scroller game what's cool is it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.719 
a side scroller game what's cool is it's
a<00:01:05.580> side<00:01:05.760> scroller<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> 2d<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> 3d

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a side scroller but it's a 2d with a 3d

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.490 
a side scroller but it's a 2d with a 3d
okay<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.330> 2d<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:09.900> 2<00:01:10.080> D<00:01:10.200> means<00:01:10.380> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
okay it's not 2d because 2 D means it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
okay it's not 2d because 2 D means it's
a<00:01:10.560> flat<00:01:10.830> image<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:12.030> moving<00:01:12.420> across<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.960> flat

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
a flat image that's moving across a flat

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.390 
a flat image that's moving across a flat
surface<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> 3d<00:01:17.220> side

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
surface this is a it's a 3d side

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
surface this is a it's a 3d side
scroller<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.909> basically<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
scroller it's basically what it is so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
scroller it's basically what it is so
let<00:01:19.290> me<00:01:19.380> show<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.430> exactly

guy that gave me this is a blueprint

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.580 
guy that gave me this is a blueprint
opening<00:01:29.549> map<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.409> they<00:01:31.409> basically

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590

opening map like they they basically
give<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.090> starter<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.720> coding<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> how

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
give you the starter off coding of how

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
give you the starter off coding of how
to<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.700> person<00:01:36.150> third<00:01:36.450> person<00:01:36.509> side

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to make a first person third person side

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.270 
to make a first person third person side
scroller<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.740> top-down

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
scroller or top-down

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.810 
scroller or top-down
game<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.869> awesome<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.549> let's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
game really awesome I think so let's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
game really awesome I think so let's
just<00:01:42.030> walk<00:01:42.210> around<00:01:42.360> real<00:01:42.600> quick<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.049> really

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
just walk around real quick it's really

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
just walk around real quick it's really
short<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> these<00:01:45.000> particles<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
short we have this these particles that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
short we have this these particles that
are<00:01:45.840> able<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.560> bounce<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.490> my

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
are able to actually bounce off of my

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
are able to actually bounce off of my
character<00:01:48.119> which<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.479> thought<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:48.869> really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
character which I thought was really

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.100 
character which I thought was really
cool<00:01:49.259> fantastic<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:51.390> basically<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
cool fantastic and that's basically it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.190 
cool fantastic and that's basically it
lights<00:01:52.649> pillars<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> staircase<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
lights pillars and a staircase the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.649 
lights pillars and a staircase the
staircase<00:01:55.229> works<00:01:55.829> fine<00:01:56.070> nothing<00:01:56.520> wrong<00:01:57.420> or

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
staircase works fine nothing wrong or

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.240

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.480 
off the part even though how they look
they<00:02:03.930> look<00:02:03.960> awesome<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.619> gotta<00:02:04.799> say<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.070> if

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
they look awesome I gotta say like if

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.820 
they look awesome I gotta say like if
you<00:02:05.869> take<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.560> prop<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.369> up<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:09.560> mean<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you take this and prop it up I mean the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.160 
you take this and prop it up I mean the
particles<00:02:11.370> bounce<00:02:11.910> off<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> could

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
particles bounce off and then it could

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.000 
particles bounce off and then it could
even

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
even

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.270 
even
go<00:02:14.220> off<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.360> down<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.290> make<00:02:17.159> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
go off that and go down and make the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.680 
go off that and go down and make the
particles<00:02:17.760> bounce<00:02:18.299> off<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:20.239> table<00:02:21.239> which

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
particles bounce off of the table which

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.580 
particles bounce off of the table which
is<00:02:21.720> really<00:02:22.110> sick

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
let me just angle this correctly there

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.809 
let me just angle this correctly there
we<00:02:26.489> go

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
we go

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.130 
we go
and<00:02:26.909> let<00:02:27.420> me<00:02:27.510> angle<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.959> one<00:02:28.170> correctly<00:02:30.140> it's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and let me angle this one correctly it's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.559 
and let me angle this one correctly it's
it's<00:02:31.440> first<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.220> all<00:02:32.340> particles<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.030> love<00:02:33.330> in

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569

Unreal<00:02:34.110> Engine<00:02:34.310> much<00:02:35.310> better<00:02:35.610> much<00:02:35.940> easier<00:02:36.330> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
Unreal Engine much better much easier to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.240 
Unreal Engine much better much easier to
use<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.049> mean<00:02:37.349> look<00:02:37.470> at<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.650> they're<00:02:37.950> probably

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
even going to bounce off with this one

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.470 
even going to bounce off with this one
right<00:02:39.540> there<00:02:39.930> yeah<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.379> are<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.489> really
