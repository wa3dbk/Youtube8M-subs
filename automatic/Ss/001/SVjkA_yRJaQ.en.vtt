 welcome to all eggs 88 in this 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.769
 I will teach you how to handle your 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.330
 computer without keyboard that means 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.779
 that if you do not have a keyboard too 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.880
 can manage your computer or what 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.619
 we can do because we want to just 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.020
 you can not use the keyboard by 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.110
 fun for fun then it's very 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.450
 easy to use your computer without keyboard 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.640
 so then good, let's go to home 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.720
 and let's go to the control panel 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.700
 here we are going to go where it says category and 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.170
 let's select where it says icons 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.780
 small so that all the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.760
 options 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.280
 we're going to give you where the center says 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.980
 accessibility 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.120
 and here we are going to give you where it says start 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.900
 the on-screen keyboard 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.850
 we double click 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.550
 and as you automatically see us 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 a keyboard comes out 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.590
 a digital keyboard with which we can 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690
 use for our computer 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.920
 then let's try the keyboard by 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.009
 example let's go to google 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.619
 and once we're here on google 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.250
 we simply visit what we want 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.110
 search for 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.110
 for example I will search on youtube 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.140
 in Youtube 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.060
 and I give it to you and as you can see here digita 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.190
 everything one wants to look for is worth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.460
 then with this keyboard we can 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.050
 replace it with the normal keyboard if not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 we have keyboard or the keyboard was damaged 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.920
 we can use this and we can even 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.320
 take out of all the commands if we want 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.900
 xerez and here is the rice 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.090
 and the rice does not come out we can erase 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.189
 we can look for what we want 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.859

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.619
 application that comes with windows and good 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:00.409
