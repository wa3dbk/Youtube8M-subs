 proposals sent by us 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.890

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.600
 eg suggestion number one gamer gates that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 maybe well meant and as 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780

 swirl of insult and harassment 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.400

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.390
 pre-order boni for big titles the 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.550

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.290
 actually studied for pre order luki 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 must have and you afterwards anyway 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.790
 the feeling has only half the game 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
