00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:27.060
 bought for five dollars 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 headphones like a zipper from the kuki range 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.260

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:08.900

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.289
 a microphone 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:11.160

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.880

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.480

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:49.820
