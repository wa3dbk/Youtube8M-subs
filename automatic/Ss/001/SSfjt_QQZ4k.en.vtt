00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.160 
when you're wearing jackets and coats
because<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.430> now<00:03:00.580> sits<00:03:00.970> below<00:03:01.270> your<00:03:01.630> coat<00:03:01.900> line

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
because it now sits below your coat line

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.900 
because it now sits below your coat line
and<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.769> don't<00:03:02.799> have<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.220> go<00:03:03.310> underneath<00:03:03.790> your

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
and you don't have to go underneath your

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.610 
and you don't have to go underneath your
coat<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.480> get<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.989> or<00:03:05.080> anything<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:05.410> that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
coat to get to it or anything like that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.440 
coat to get to it or anything like that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
so that's kind of nice the the dangler

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.229 
so that's kind of nice the the dangler
system<00:03:10.900> actually<00:03:11.170> comes<00:03:11.769> in<00:03:11.950> handy<00:03:12.239> because

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
