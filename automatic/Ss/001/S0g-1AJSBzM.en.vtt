though<00:04:50.110> that's<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.200> good<00:04:51.350> way<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.500> start<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
though that's a good way to start the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:05:01.359 
though that's a good way to start the
day<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:53.240> hopefully<00:04:53.419> I'll<00:04:53.660> be<00:04:53.690> back

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:01.369 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:02.600 

well

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
well

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.499 
well
still<00:05:02.990> stumbling<00:05:03.990> around<00:05:04.080> out<00:05:04.409> here<00:05:05.509> anyways

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
still stumbling around out here anyways

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.309 
still stumbling around out here anyways
I<00:05:06.629> think<00:05:06.810> I've<00:05:06.900> got<00:05:07.080> something<00:05:07.289> down<00:05:07.469> here

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
I think I've got something down here

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.659 
I think I've got something down here
could<00:05:10.319> be<00:05:10.620> like<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.490> Lake<00:05:11.909> Mohave<00:05:12.229> Silver<00:05:13.229> Lake

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
could be like a Lake Mohave Silver Lake

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.480 
could be like a Lake Mohave Silver Lake
somewhere<00:05:14.669> in<00:05:14.909> there<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:16.770> it<00:05:16.919> is<00:05:17.039> what<00:05:17.219> it<00:05:17.340> is

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
somewhere in there if it is what it is

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.800 
somewhere in there if it is what it is
it's<00:05:17.819> a<00:05:17.909> paleo<00:05:18.710> paleo<00:05:19.710> dealio<00:05:20.159> I<00:05:23.629> think<00:05:24.629> that's

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
it's a paleo paleo dealio I think that's

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:34.490 
it's a paleo paleo dealio I think that's
what<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:28.610> they<00:05:29.610> stand<00:05:33.199> yeah<00:05:34.199> I<00:05:34.229> don't<00:05:34.379> see

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
what it is they stand yeah I don't see

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.179 
what it is they stand yeah I don't see
too<00:05:34.650> many<00:05:34.770> up<00:05:35.430> this<00:05:35.639> way<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:37.740> that<00:05:37.860> makes<00:05:38.039> it

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
too many up this way so that makes it

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.050 
too many up this way so that makes it
makes<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.610> little<00:05:38.789> more<00:05:38.909> special<00:05:41.060> hopefully

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
makes a little more special hopefully

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.110 
makes a little more special hopefully
I'll<00:05:42.180> be<00:05:42.210> back

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.710 

I<00:05:47.380> got<00:05:48.380> something<00:05:48.680> else<00:05:48.770> down<00:05:49.070> here<00:05:49.510> it's<00:05:50.510> real

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
I got something else down here it's real

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.080 
I got something else down here it's real
close<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.139> that<00:05:51.889> last<00:05:52.130> point<00:05:52.520> I<00:05:52.820> think

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
close to that that last point I think

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.730 
close to that that last point I think
it's<00:05:53.240> just<00:05:53.360> going<00:05:53.450> to<00:05:53.510> be<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.660> part<00:05:56.260> that's<00:05:57.260> all

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
it's just going to be a part that's all

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.980 
it's just going to be a part that's all
it<00:05:57.860> is
