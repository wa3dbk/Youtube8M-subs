00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 They can coin damage RW to the positive 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.359
 side point nl the links in the description 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 and oh yes you did not forget the code 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.800
 hard on a led capital letters too 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 use yo people for 5% off and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.330
 welcome to my first impressions 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.490
 videos from the World Cup update 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 fifa 14 for two games will show 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.400
 eat those things in brazil 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 one with the Netherlands I will belt me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.189
 talk about how the game has been before 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.510
 I played a few of course 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 Portugal just doesn't either 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.019
 I have had to include their views 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.480
 gets brutal plays it feels a bit 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.090
 as a bit of stuff we have a more pleasant version 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.340
 of it you it and how you explain it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 it then it is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 previously balanced but the pace 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 what is allowed in the difference with the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.420
 update now is that the safe will be faster 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.930
 plays for my feeling and that is one 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.760
 something good 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.200
 because I really enjoy playing 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 only the pace is in the off and on 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.140
 add some layer of cross to calling again 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.789
 80 rate this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 rating set gold based on the more 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.570
 players do with national team people 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.489
 to my mind in any case I 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.840
 find it pretty nice to play it so far 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.160
 the social looks colorful and colorful 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.750
 I always like that so much better 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.030
 you will be pleasant to watch 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.379
 it is going to play well and I have to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.220
 say the dribbling feels because different 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.710
 out in it is what softe but it feels 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.900
 something I think is more realistic in the sense of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.130
 the ball goes with what else it stays 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.439
 not legally can stick your foot like 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.580
 healthy with those ltr t tribble you have 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.780
 well that can be my fault 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.119
 just experienced it was nice 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.549
 in itself but it was something different 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.869
 I also noticed keepers are better 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.400
 one time I am not always in doubt 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.270
 is before my you then i will never bring anything 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.979
 to have 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.329
 but keepers feel better 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.920
 not so thundering so I hit every ball 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.900
 walk past as roll so stab job 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 search give they are want 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.530
 the ball would fix you more often so a little less 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.409
 water rebounds of course is something else 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 well but it is already less and about whether and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 I just had a nicer walk anyway 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.570
 is pleasant and the games respond too 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.220
 sometimes you have lost folders that you 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.649
 Bass v think why do not there 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.759
 go and grab the ball so strange I 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 have the feeling that players are there until now 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.869
 respond better and that is 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.549
 of course an improved something because sat 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 often I sit down know the player upstairs 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.350
 always fits in the hall or wrong 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.000
 just stupid things and everywhere 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.560
 I think it plays a little more pleasant look 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.960
 it's not the ultimate team it's not like that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 fluent but good that 's up to him too 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.929
 so made me to be and I 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.250
 got the update is not there yet at least 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.690
 best of course is but you can 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.630
 do not roll the machine yet 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 so i'm sure 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.890
 plan to do holtum series tomorrow 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.690
 at least you ultimate team series 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.510
 I just want the World Cup this is going to play 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.010
 and maybe with facecam i don't know 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.510
 anyway like i want to do it 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.310
 and that is now that goes so I am 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.110
 curious and you see me just the stream 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 play and then think of how gurus 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.240
 stuff to how fit how does this feel 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.680
 other than normal fifa what for me 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.430
 strange that I do not often with at all 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.960
 passion you have it it is whole 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.450
 strange to say but is evil enough 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.340
 I didn't really like it because I do 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.460
 notes that neymar and dani alves really 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.990
 gods fucking gods just like fernandinho 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.000
 find duo is a good at normal game 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.410
 he feels a lot better here than me 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.120
 also can say is do not use kaka 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.250
 people please he is terrible 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.770
 he says in the 80 so now know 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.140
 which in itself is so reasonably hi es 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.700
 but good first just pot it 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.590
 extension years ran pretty bad 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.490
 my day to you know what i'm taking 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.770
 just the Netherlands 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.240
 well of course lens has ended in 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.670
 80 knows 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.380
 super super nice player dutch 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.400
 team plays everywhere very well me 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.980
 the only person will not like it 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.680
 use reason for this is one takes the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.850
 worship and then you wonder why the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.860
 association just still doesn't play 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.080
 nice and that is clear and that is 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.000
 but it is just how you can 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.000
 because the midfield is super fine with 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
 Sneijder Strootman and Dion just have it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.330
 really great to our midfielder again 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
 at sneijder just really the offensive 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.590
 of the three, she is nigel de jong 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.810
 of course went online les cimes or 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.830
 luc no nigel the young is super fine 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.990
 defending itself with noise 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.160
 wordpress I still really believe that 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.770
 continues to act that grab that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.970
 promise cares about the ready and straw man 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.800
 is a bit of bother you that is just 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.870
 really a tank that can just forward 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.340
 bursting bit improved this way 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.990
 there is quite a lot better way 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.550
 Leroy Fer naturally sees more 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.890
 Also the ball wooden ball well with them 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.420
 hands it over to lens and that lens scores 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.070
 with four and six kills and how i am for it 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.750
 I think is more that still goes very often 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.950
 see though I do not know if people also the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.940
 will use pie that will all 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.350
 turn out 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.180
 but the advantage is with this hold'em 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.440
 team you don't play the pictures on purpose 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.120
 entrance are the lot 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.410
 it's a citizen of course 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.459
 edges are more the entrance the sphere is there 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.570
 no market 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.980
 so the only way we decide 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.480
 get out packs so you just have to 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.120
 lucky you get my good players 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.830
 what is nice is what i know for sure 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.840
 have a black pitch and you can be a player 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.160
 from over 85 it did or did 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.030
 that everyone is so settings or 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.500
 Netherlands has probably put 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.430
 everyone from persie calls get the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.660
 first pack 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.030
 that's the least I believe I really believe 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.410
 no 12 start with social video you see 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.120
 so have to buy from pax to that one 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.560
 place that also gets smart grace from you 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.750
 you have to go super way with it 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.950
 anyway i 'm going to open lab ex i am 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.870
 curious what you think of this game until now 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.460
 find out if you have or have done it 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.510
 blackbird top 10 videos tomorrow and i would 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.510
 say and look
