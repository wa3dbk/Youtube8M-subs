00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:21.010
 and in the attic and stupidly up 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.230

 will spend money on one girl and 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.150
 this girl will be me that day when you 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.019
 you can get this picture out of your mind 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.519
 i will forgive you 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.290
 since you have ever asked me why 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.769
 I had to take that step 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.239
 does this justify you nickname 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.250
 ever thought about that 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.930
 the last three years our life has been spinning 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.089

 months and your far from perfect guy 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.040
 paid bills 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.559
 and then jerry needed my help 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.400
 of course it was an idea j more precisely with 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:11.950
 Radhika wear today lives in the reception 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.810
 family and the truth is that for jerry's sake i 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 ready to hire men a hundred times 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.960

 times to you people can live on the show 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.619

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.799
 you're here 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.070

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.159

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.200
 papaya yoke 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:17.250
 who told you this books if nobody 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 the truth is always on his side radhika 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.680
 if the nickname is not perfect here and also not 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.500
 present trouble is that we often 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.590
 make mistakes but never ask 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.590
 forgiveness, even I once offended your mother 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.510
 but I did not have time to apologize forgiving 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.170
 love is stronger in any relationship alone 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.280
 mistake you need to forgive though don't worry 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590
 everything will be fine 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.650
 Relax 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.650
 Well
