00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello and welcome in front of us 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.330
 today is a real specialist and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.960
 though silverstones ds 380 this is a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 mini itx housing actually but with 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 Focus on the storage 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 skills was developed 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.199
 that means we have in the housing in it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.400
 Space for twelve hard drives or SSDs 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:30.019
 and we have eight hot swap bays 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.960
 which are accessible via the front 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.320
 the whole optically still pretty chic 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 held with aluminum front and yes 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.219
 everything else to the ds 380 that we clarify 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.219
 then in the video 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.920
 from the somewhat voluminous cardboard 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.440
 comes a rather small housing 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 to the fore 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.260
 So really small form factor 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.630
 accordingly, the whole very inconspicuous 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.320
 is now synonymous rather than one 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.680
 geared and fits 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 visually definitely there as well in 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.619
 a work environment 1 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 the front rounded and brushed 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.850
 aluminum here works high quality and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.340
 robust with the switch then centered 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.740
 let in little status led next to it 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.550
 all very simple and how I think 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.580
 visually appealing to open the front 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.450
 you have to go here this unconventional 5 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.229
 can you can use a key 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.459
 release lock and then has 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.319
 Access to this eight drive 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.850
 drawers 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.220
 the hard disks or ssds become so 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.569
 bolted and then you can do the whole thing 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.240
 just be pushed back into it 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.950
 uncomplicated solved here then also seo 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.020
 panel that is who the connections 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:30.610
 wants to use must open the front door 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.099
 opening angle about 180 degrees then too 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.610
 her the reset button is also 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.610
 forbidden 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.120
 Cooling Silverstone has three fans 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.580
 pre-assembled everything 120 millimeters fan 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.430
 We see two of them behind here 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.700
 Magnetic dust filter on the side 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.660
 the third sits on the back wall 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:01.110
 otherwise we have still 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:04.260
 cover an air yes an outlet of 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.489
 also of how this magnetic 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.989
 dust filter is covered this 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.890
 Air intake for the power supply 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.340
 Power supply itself should be a sfx power supply 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.709
 his 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.730
 that means here you have to buy 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.190
 respect, think highly of 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.989
 the sims small sized power supply too 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.530
 buy a back already too 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.819
 recognize the basic construction but 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.959
 to where it is of course the same also 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.019
 have a look directly 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.280
 only the right side part can be 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.920
 when ds3 180 lose weight also sits with 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.230
 two regular screws on the housing 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.420
 and yes, when we look in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.459
 Of course the question is how can I do so 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.930
 mount hardware 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.590
 then there are more screws to 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.829
 to solve 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:59.280
 on the disk cage and then 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.640
 can you then this whole circle 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 remove plates cage from the housing 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.730
 as we see here then beautiful the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.480
 backplate solution for the hot swap 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.480
 ability 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.449
 and then finally the look in 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.940
 the interior possible the mainboard 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.740
 then sits at the opposite 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.880
 wand the expansion cards come after 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.710
 So the whole thing is upside down 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.990
 and we have upper areas here 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.720
 the corner then also this separate 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.800
 two and a half inch drives cage for 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 four ssds or two and a half inches 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.510
 festplatten 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.070
 the whole thing is extraordinary 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.060
 not painted black we have 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:57.490
 So still this computer club earlier 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.479
 housing generation but in such a 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.240
 work equipment is this too 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.160
 get over 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.180
 otherwise, the whole thing will work at first 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.510
 look not very elaborate though 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.889
 thought-out and for the purpose of the 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:19.550
 silverstone here is definitely aiming 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:22.639
 convincing we will be the ds 380 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.260
 now of course more detailed 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:31.900
 and then in the near future a detailed 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.900
