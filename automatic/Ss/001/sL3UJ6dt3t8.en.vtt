see here I can't change the video
quality<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:30.199> mean<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.410> there's<00:00:31.590> no

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
quality I mean like there's no

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.120 
quality I mean like there's no
possibility<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.610> me<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130
