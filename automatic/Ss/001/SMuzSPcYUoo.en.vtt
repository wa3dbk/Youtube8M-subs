any of that happening the newborns are
going<00:02:46.110> straight<00:02:46.410> into<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.890> net<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.900> will

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
going straight into a net that will

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.680 
going straight into a net that will
probably<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.220> way<00:02:53.480> man<00:02:54.480> they<00:02:54.660> really

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690

probably be in this way man they really
silted<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.370> it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
silted this up I don't like it

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.840 
silted this up I don't like it
worried<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.960> it'll<00:02:58.200> make<00:02:58.440> my<00:02:58.680> fish<00:02:59.310> sick<00:02:59.670> or

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
worried that it'll make my fish sick or

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.280

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
something but I can't get it to go back

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.500 
something but I can't get it to go back
down<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.130> there's<00:03:02.460> not<00:03:02.700> much<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.030> really<00:03:03.180> do

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
down so there's not much I can really do

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.760

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
coulis will do this during like a big

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.150 
coulis will do this during like a big
storm<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.320> something<00:03:25.680> when<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.830> storms<00:03:26.100> coming

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
storm or something when a storms coming

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.680 
storm or something when a storms coming
they'll<00:03:27.000> start<00:03:27.239> spinning<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.080> slamming<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
they'll start spinning and slamming and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.699 
they'll start spinning and slamming and
messing<00:03:30.690> around<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.050> it'll<00:03:31.380> get<00:03:31.560> pretty

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
messing around and it'll get pretty

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.220 
messing around and it'll get pretty
murky<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:32.610> usually<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:33.150> back<00:03:34.020> to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
murky like this but usually it's back to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.160 
murky like this but usually it's back to
normal<00:03:34.260> within<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:35.070> few<00:03:35.250> hours<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:36.720> not<00:03:36.780> doing
