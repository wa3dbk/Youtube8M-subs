 you can see that it does not have 120 reais 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.970
 I want to see several other options 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:57.889
 at least 120 which means that the TV she 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 It's 67 if you do it's how it's spoken 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.519
 interpolated is interleaved I can not remember 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 the technical term now you understand 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:12.030
