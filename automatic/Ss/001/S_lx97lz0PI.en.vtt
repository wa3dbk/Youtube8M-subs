layers now this is pretty much the base

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.080 
layers now this is pretty much the base
of<00:00:48.270> everything<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> need

while<00:00:51.090> making<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.710> I'm<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> start

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
while making this so I'm going to start

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:04.939 
while making this so I'm going to start
off<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:56.870> itz<00:00:58.340> and<00:01:01.520> ro<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> reason<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.710> did

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
off with itz and ro in the reason I did

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.590 
off with itz and ro in the reason I did
that<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.360> too

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that is because they're a little too

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.370 
that is because they're a little too
spaced<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:10.640> if<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.360> normally<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.080> i<00:01:13.320> do

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
spaced out if I do it normally if i do

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
spaced out if I do it normally if i do
it<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.490> pressing<00:01:14.909> enter<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.750> that's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it like just pressing enter so that's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.940 
it like just pressing enter so that's
why<00:01:16.170> i<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> way<00:01:17.330> now<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.810> merge<00:01:19.710> visible

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
why i do it that way now I merge visible

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.469

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
do with the background layer to add

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.600 
do with the background layer to add
layer<00:06:09.150> mask<00:06:09.530> make<00:06:10.530> sure<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:10.860> only<00:06:10.980> have<00:06:11.280> white

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
layer mask make sure you only have white

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.880 
layer mask make sure you only have white
pool<00:06:11.910> opacity<00:06:12.660> text<00:06:13.140> because<00:06:13.560> if<00:06:13.680> you<00:06:13.770> have
