00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
crappie what I done to do that is taken

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.889 
crappie what I done to do that is taken
by<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.829> these<00:01:51.710> Coleman<00:01:52.710> glow<00:01:53.220> sticks<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:56.899> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
by one these Coleman glow sticks and to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.139 
by one these Coleman glow sticks and to
activate<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.890> shake<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.490> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
activate that you just shake it up and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.219 
activate that you just shake it up and
then<00:02:01.110> bend<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> tell<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.640> hear<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> snap

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.130 

first<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.680> after<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:08.520> finished

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
first thing to do after that's finished

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:17.650 
first thing to do after that's finished
is<00:02:11.660> main<00:02:12.660> line<00:02:13.790> I'll<00:02:14.790> take<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.180> add<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> bead

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
is main line I'll take and add a bead

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.949 
is main line I'll take and add a bead
then<00:02:18.660> tie<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> loop<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.470> main<00:02:19.650> line<00:02:20.959> just

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
then tie a loop on the main line just

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.630 
then tie a loop on the main line just
like<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.260> would<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> were<00:02:23.459> going

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
like you would if you were going

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.619 
like you would if you were going
fly-fishing<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.690> add<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.140> tip<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.629> what

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
fly-fishing to add a tip up and what

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.700 
fly-fishing to add a tip up and what
that<00:02:27.660> bead<00:02:28.110> does<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:30.050> stops<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:32.000> loop<00:02:33.000> from

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
that bead does is it stops the loop from

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.120 
that bead does is it stops the loop from
being<00:02:35.430> pulled<00:02:35.730> back<00:02:36.450> through<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.960> guide<00:02:37.200> at

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
being pulled back through the guide at

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.510 
being pulled back through the guide at
the<00:02:38.400> very<00:02:38.580> tip<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> rod<00:02:40.910> most<00:02:42.410> panfish

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
the very tip of the rod most panfish

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.400 
the very tip of the rod most panfish
you're<00:02:44.520> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> take<00:02:45.000> from<00:02:45.660> shore<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
you're going to take from shore and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.850 
you're going to take from shore and
throw<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.510> depth<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.800> know

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
throw out the you know depth on you know

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.400 
throw out the you know depth on you know
five<00:02:50.190> or<00:02:50.220> six<00:02:50.610> feet<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.750> next<00:02:54.990> step<00:02:55.140> of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
