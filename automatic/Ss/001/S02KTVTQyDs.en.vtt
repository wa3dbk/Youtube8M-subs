finger so it's great about that is that
it's<00:03:34.640> not<00:03:34.700> as<00:03:34.970> limited<00:03:35.240> as<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.690> ghost<00:03:35.930> host<00:03:36.200> is

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
it's not as limited as the ghost host is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.949 
it's not as limited as the ghost host is
you<00:03:37.400> know<00:03:37.520> where<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:37.850> put<00:03:38.330> my<00:03:38.450> hand<00:03:38.660> up<00:03:38.810> and

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
you know where I just put my hand up and

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.170 
you know where I just put my hand up and
down<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.350> one<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.770> could<00:03:39.920> do<00:03:40.040> anything<00:03:40.670> with

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
down this one you could do anything with

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.750 
down this one you could do anything with
this<00:03:41.420> one<00:03:41.660> arch<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.740> bit

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
this one arch it a bit

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.589 
this one arch it a bit
make<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> job<00:03:45.360> work<00:03:45.599> just<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.590> upper<00:03:46.769> hand

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
make the job work just the upper hand

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.640 
make the job work just the upper hand
and<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:50.459> can<00:03:50.670> have<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.260> trying<00:03:52.440> to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
and you can have you know I'm trying to

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.930 
and you can have you know I'm trying to
experiment<00:03:53.069> some<00:03:53.340> more<00:03:53.489> with<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.670> floating

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
experiment some more with the floating

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.509 
experiment some more with the floating
in<00:03:54.120> effect<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.830> allow<00:03:56.010> freedom<00:03:56.310> of

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
in effect but you can allow freedom of

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.440 
in effect but you can allow freedom of
movement<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.269> more<00:03:58.019> fluid<00:03:59.269> because<00:04:00.269> he's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
movement and more fluid because he's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.650 
movement and more fluid because he's
ahead<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:02.010> yeah<00:04:02.819> that's<00:04:03.030> how<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.209> made<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
ahead so yeah that's how I made the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.710 
ahead so yeah that's how I made the
