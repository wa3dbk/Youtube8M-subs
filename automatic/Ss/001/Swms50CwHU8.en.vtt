typical erratic behavior with what I'm
sure<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> toy<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> camera

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
right there incredible speed as we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660 
right there incredible speed as we

rewind and zoom in on the footage we can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
rewind and zoom in on the footage we can
get<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> closer<00:01:24.570> look<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:25.259> dealing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
get a closer look at what we're dealing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.190 
get a closer look at what we're dealing
with<00:01:26.509> right<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:29.250> seems<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.079> exist<00:01:31.079> on
