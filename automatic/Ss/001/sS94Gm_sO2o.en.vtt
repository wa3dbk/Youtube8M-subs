going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:38.940> i<00:00:39.469> also<00:00:40.469> bought<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190

adapter<00:00:42.290> for<00:00:43.610> 27<00:00:44.610> bucks<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> thought<00:00:45.750> that's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
adapter for 27 bucks so I thought that's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:01:04.850 
adapter for 27 bucks so I thought that's
pretty<00:00:46.140> good<00:00:46.230> deal<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:03.239> feels<00:01:03.840> kind<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.680> light

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
pretty good deal it feels kind of light

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
pretty good deal it feels kind of light
Oh<00:01:05.129> gonna<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.000> heavier<00:01:06.950> try<00:01:07.950> lady<00:01:08.909> that's<00:01:09.360> why

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Oh gonna be heavier try lady that's why

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.399 
Oh gonna be heavier try lady that's why
I<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.720> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.320> low<00:01:10.470> price<00:01:10.890> tag<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.340> thought

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
I was kind of a low price tag I thought

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.300 
I was kind of a low price tag I thought
let's<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.100> else<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:16.310> so

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
let's go or else on the back here so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
let's go or else on the back here so
apparently<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> input<00:01:19.880> from<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
apparently when you input from here I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.499 
apparently when you input from here I
could<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:24.090> input<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:24.530> guitar<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
could do that you input your guitar is

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.760 
could do that you input your guitar is
this<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.930> automatically<00:01:28.320> turns<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this that automatically turns it on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.160 
this that automatically turns it on
except<00:01:29.610> i<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.229> mp3<00:01:31.829> player<00:01:31.860> i

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.810 

guess<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.320> goes<00:01:37.560> between<00:01:37.799> stereo<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.670> just

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
guess this goes between stereo and just

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
guess this goes between stereo and just
wanna<00:01:39.470> put<00:01:40.470> your<00:01:40.590> headphones<00:01:40.770> into<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:42.380> pick
