again<00:00:10.590> I'll<00:00:10.860> mix<00:00:11.160> up<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.519> burnt<00:00:11.759> sienna<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
again I'll mix up some burnt sienna and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.200 
again I'll mix up some burnt sienna and
ultramarine<00:00:12.960> blue<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.860> leaner<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.639> time<00:00:14.940> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
ultramarine blue but leaner this time I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.269 
ultramarine blue but leaner this time I
want<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:15.750> rocks<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.379> much<00:00:16.590> lighter<00:00:16.949> than

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
want these rocks to be much lighter than

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.429 
want these rocks to be much lighter than
the<00:00:17.369> distant<00:00:17.789> cliff<00:00:20.300> with<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.480> flat<00:00:21.840> brush

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
the distant cliff with my flat brush

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.230 
the distant cliff with my flat brush
I'll<00:00:22.500> work<00:00:22.830> these<00:00:23.010> colors<00:00:23.430> into<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> closest

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
I'll work these colors into the closest

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150 
I'll work these colors into the closest
group<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.570> rocks<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> keep<00:00:25.980> these

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
group of rocks I want to keep these

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130 
group of rocks I want to keep these
fairly<00:00:26.609> light<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> value--the<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> want

fairly light and value--the and I want

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.030 
fairly light and value--the and I want
these<00:00:28.260> colors<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.830> vary<00:00:33.230> I'll<00:00:34.230> add<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.800> rose

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
these colors to vary I'll add some rose

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.819 
these colors to vary I'll add some rose
to<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> mix<00:00:35.809> I've<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> keep<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.469> edges

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to the mix I've got to keep these edges

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.799 
to the mix I've got to keep these edges
moving<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.430> they'll<00:00:38.579> set<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.149> hard<00:00:39.360> edges

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809

edge that I'm not focusing on I need to
keep<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.180> edges<00:00:48.480> moving<00:00:48.840> while<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
keep all of the edges moving while the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.709 
keep all of the edges moving while the
paint<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> wet<00:00:49.739> unless<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.180> them<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.420> form

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

before these colors dry I'll have some

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
before these colors dry I'll have some
salt<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.479> texture<00:01:15.960> salt<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.189> create<00:01:17.549> some

salt for texture salt can create some

these areas of rocks it would be

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.820 
these areas of rocks it would be

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
I had really intended for these to be

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.970 
I had really intended for these to be
between<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.780> values<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> rocks<00:03:30.590> above

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
between the values of the rocks above

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.740 
between the values of the rocks above
and<00:03:31.190> below<00:03:31.400> them<00:03:31.670> but<00:03:32.150> even<00:03:32.300> though<00:03:32.569> they're<00:03:32.720> a

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
and below them but even though they're a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.140 
and below them but even though they're a
bit<00:03:32.990> lighter<00:03:33.230> than<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.620> have<00:03:33.740> intended<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.490> like

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
bit lighter than I have intended I like

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.720 
bit lighter than I have intended I like
the<00:03:35.330> look<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.930> I'm<00:03:35.990> going<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.200> go<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.740> who

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the look so I'm going to go with it who

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.920 
the look so I'm going to go with it who
says<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.240> there's<00:03:38.450> rules<00:03:40.510> I'll<00:03:41.510> add<00:03:41.720> some

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
says that there's rules I'll add some

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.350 
says that there's rules I'll add some
darker<00:03:42.319> areas<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:42.980> actually<00:03:43.520> this<00:03:43.790> group<00:03:44.150> will

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
darker areas so actually this group will

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.540 
darker areas so actually this group will
have<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.540> mix<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:45.050> values<00:03:45.530> these<00:03:46.160> are<00:03:46.400> going<00:03:46.489> to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
have a mix of values these are going to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.070 
have a mix of values these are going to
stand<00:03:46.850> out<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.060> bit<00:03:47.209> more<00:03:47.630> than<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.959> other

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
stand out a bit more than the other

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.380 
stand out a bit more than the other
rocks
