details of her dress let's put a few
crystals<00:03:49.060> right<00:03:49.810> here<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:55.090> basically<00:03:55.540> how<00:03:55.989> I

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
crystals right here and basically how I

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.259 
crystals right here and basically how I
draw<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.319> crystals<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:59.849> I'm<00:04:00.849> just<00:04:00.939> going<00:04:01.209> to

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
draw the crystals is I'm just going to

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.530 
draw the crystals is I'm just going to
start<00:04:01.540> with<00:04:02.400> kind<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.609> kite<00:04:03.939> shape<00:04:03.970> so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
like that so I got the kite shape I'm

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.119 
like that so I got the kite shape I'm
going<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.739> draw<00:04:08.980> two<00:04:09.280> lines<00:04:10.150> coming<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.129> but
