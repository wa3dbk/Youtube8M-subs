 videogames the copyright and all the roll 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.350
 because I have to remove the videos from 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.050
 the trailers for the same thing because I 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.509
 was missing the copyright and I preferred 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.610

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.290
 Spanish language I think it was in English 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.650
 Well the egg in English perfectly 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.420
 next we accept the following here 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.120
 we have the directory where it goes to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.620
 install the next game if you want 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.930
 create the icon on the desktop too 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.280
 the gesture that has given or following and 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.430
 we started installing and we let go 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.430
 installing 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.120
 well here as we are already in the 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.480
 installation is running the commands 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.080
 that are left and now we have to leave 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.080
 in directx 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.629
 we are the contract we are going to next 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.159
 we let you install here as you know no 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.159
 it takes nothing this to settle 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.020
 we're going to finish and we're going to execute 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.750
 dragon ball budokai tenkaichi dragon 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.220
 ball z we get this window in the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.600
 which if you want you can configure 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.430
 First 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.770
 that I 'm going to do it where 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.300
 It was in display I'm going to change the 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.660
 resolution 1920 x 1080 ok and we are going to 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.660
 give to play 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.489
 well here we have the game 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.489
 Let's see how it goes 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.910
 touching discovered that the X is like 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.580
 if it were the enter 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.140
 or the letter the zetas to go back 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.720
 the d to load 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.690
 force 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.640
 and the star to fly although I 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.560
 some are missing but that's because 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.680
 I go and you put some command what 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.550
 is to go playing and go finding out what is 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.590
 very easy 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.880
 is to investigate a little but good and 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.880
 you have the game that is the important thing 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.519
 put a resolution like that fair so that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.519
 do not occupy much 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.230
 and now lower the volume because I 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.230
 it seems that all host 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.290
 OK 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.229
 in this mission 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.750
 this sensitive is already done 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:01.869
 the excellent recipe to go back 

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:03.330
 to load the myth and the is for 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.620
 fly to be able to fly 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.919
 this has been all the tasks 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:13.979
 absent records of the game and 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.650
 subscribe to all the new ones and we see 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:20.599
 nothing like always in the next more and 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.599
 better and also as always
