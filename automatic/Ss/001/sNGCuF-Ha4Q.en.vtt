00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello we will have lunch 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.540
 the truth is it won't be quite lunch it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.280
 this will be a light snack now I 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 usual when since i bought 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.539
 I shot all the video about the grub on 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 but now I decided to take off in my house 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 the room as usual I was shooting temporarily 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.580
 what is more convenient for me as I donâ€™t know here but 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.260
 because I have why and so eyebrows matter 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 because I have 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:36.149
 jumped some pimple something in a pit so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 I do maybe it will help me from him 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.969
 rid that he is ugly and in general 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.329
 unpleasant it won't disturb lunch well 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.309
 I think okay I'll start it does not hurt 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.379
 this is not a dinner it's just a snack at 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.670
 I just now is the time the dining 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.399
 while i'm filming means so what are we here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.329
 see here we have some things 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.890
 incomprehensible cottage and they say that with me 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 there is not very good lighting in the room 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.189
 even though I opened the dacha window in the light I somehow 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.380
 here 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.930
 but still in this capacity probably 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.460
 will not be very good but I think you are like 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.960
 would see everything better than normal 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.729
 flexible filmed incomprehensible 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.340
 So is it in the first place something at 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.759
 we are chicken meat i 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 chicken like it I take her foot filming 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.049
 all meat 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.130
 like that, before putting them together 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.439
 in some capacity and heat it up 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.630
 Yes , I don't like to hold the foot 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.509
 gnaw her like a dog 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 I don't like to gnaw a bone there 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.850
 just take the meat 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.710
 I shoot here on such pieces and yes 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.460
 I fold and warm it up I already said 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.140
 I repeat here such are obtained 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.420
 pieces of meat 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 take if but me which I just 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.409
 I decided to have a bite to eat 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.080
 not enough i will take more and here it is 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.420
 Mom made us here onion tomatoes 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.210
 finely chopped there is still something in general 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.540
 she likes to do such things once it 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.790
 seasonings which one looks very 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.650
 appetizing here and it smells nice she 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.050
 quite often it makes true i don't 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.890
 I know this here it will be that it is a bow 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.730
 very small + tomatoes and tomatoes 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.270
 they are unusual round venti such sold 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:48.400
 such long ones I do n't know she wanted 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.400
 these are the last time I do not like 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:03:05.470
 do you want tomato nanana lint 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.470
 hen 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.160
 When I was on the webcam I did 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:37.690
 bent down specifically put it here 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.300
 She for example I put her here on the edge 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.520
 bent her down she looked down right 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.890
 here this camera I can't 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:52.230
 make me a tripod no so me 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.230
 a little uncomfortable but with this camera 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:01.860
 turned a lot like that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.710
 well and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.710
 so lift yourself up 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.949
 such a small bite 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.949
 and for more say all bon appetite 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.610
 hen 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.090
 It is assumed that this is the way even the coolies 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.540
 ordinary chicken we used to buy chicken 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.520
 grill 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.230
 these are ordinary chickens glyph principle better 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.360
 do it yourself and not do it yourself 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.890
 bought every time came across different 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.440
 sometimes come across really right 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.030
 so tasty you know juicy 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.320
 mostly not very good 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.320
 so they stopped bathing 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:45.159

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.719
 straight face is white white from color not 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.359
 I know how it will end up on the record can be seen 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:54.269
 straight white in general is only eyes 

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:54.269
 visible nose and kind of the rest all gaps 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:59.579
 like zombies wanted zombies black 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.380
 tomatoes 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.930

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.310

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:47.130
