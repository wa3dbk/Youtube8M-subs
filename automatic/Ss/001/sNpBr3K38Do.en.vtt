and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.130 

another<00:02:28.550> thing<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.000> how<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.240> set<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> EQs

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
another thing is how you set the EQs

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.070 
another thing is how you set the EQs
really<00:02:31.010> make<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.460> difference<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.240> amp<00:02:32.510> so

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
really make a difference in this amp so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.690 
really make a difference in this amp so
as<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.500> can<00:02:33.620> see<00:02:33.680> I've<00:02:33.950> set<00:02:34.220> pretty<00:02:34.460> much<00:02:34.670> a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
as you can see I've set pretty much a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.750 
as you can see I've set pretty much a
standard<00:02:35.090> rock<00:02:36.050> setting<00:02:36.500> I'm<00:02:36.620> going<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.830> set

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
standard rock setting I'm going to set

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.110 
standard rock setting I'm going to set
the<00:02:37.910> eq's<00:02:38.360> right<00:02:38.780> dead<00:02:39.560> center<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.940> can

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
the eq's right dead center and you can
