00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.120
 greet you friends today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.509
 talk about two frame insulator what 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 it is and when applied 2 ramazh on 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 isolator we need at that moment 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.340
 when we need to plant the uterus 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 Immediately in the family if we give uterus 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.519
 in the layouts we have enough cap and so 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.400
 about insulator means 2 frame insulator 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.500
 It looks like this 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.510
 metal corners and mesh through 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.420
 which the bees cannot pass but 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 perfectly passes 0 air means 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.000
 inside it is empty two frames we 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 holes and here's a cap and so 2 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.700
 frame insulator today we will 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.800
 use to plant 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.579
 family uterus 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 let's go to the house and we will put there already 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 frames and so got the queens we uterus 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.160
 us in wooden boxes karpatka 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.400
 blue spot of 2015 will plant them 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.400
 right in the insulator open set there and 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.140
 put there these frames 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.880
 and the second frame in the same way inserted 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:30.340
 there with a young introducing bee in the first-aid kit 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.340
 young we got there too there just are n't 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:43.600
 It means there is when the framework of us in the insulator 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.600
 let's put the uterus in there open it 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.890
 forever opening the knife button 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:59.410
 so Lena times well and the second too 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:04.310
 open all the violinist us open 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.229
 opened there and plant when uterus 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.519
 put in an insulator we are fixed 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.400
 wrinkle hole well yes it would not open 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:22.100
 the lid or uterus has not jumped out and the bees are not 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:26.540
 climbed there killed and put it in not 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.989
 so we came to the apiary more with us already 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.019
 everything is ready and now our isolator will be 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.590
 put in the hive with the uterus for two days 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.900
 we put insulator ghouls already cooked 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.640
 pocket 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.780
 so gently lower exactly 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.379
 the middle of the nest to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.379
 the bees were heated 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.910
 all the insulator in place we are promoting 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.910
 closer frames 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.420
 a little bit about demille 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.280
 and you can collect wuling 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.120
 see everything with us is ready 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.780
 bullet we are ready to put 2 frame 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 isolator with a babe on the output young 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.570
 the uterus that was brought to the first building 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.640
 pre-cooked pocket hive 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.560
 collected in one and a half days we will 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.530
 let out a certain time 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.840
 came to let out queens of insulators 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.010
 parse the hive will work now 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.440
 we will try to work without smoke 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.440
 because it does not need to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:07.050
 to let the extra fire we take out 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.550
 insulator can be viewed visually 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.550
 natte mo. 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.410
 what razukrasim do here i see that 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.269
 got out 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.420
 young bees and a queen probably 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.650
 somewhere near the middle because here 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.650
 here's the bulk of the print 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.990
 something frightened uterus in this isolator 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.570
 she climbed the wall and crawled up 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.060
 tried to take off but gently set down 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:47.669
 her to the hive now show you how she 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.539
 walks and the important point is all uterus in 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.539
 chilli willy isolator 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.630
 here she is 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.660
 vodka here it is we have a womb blue 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.949
 speck now i'll show you closer 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.889
 people from her part 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.220
 This suggests that the reception is good 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:14.380
 Today we are launching a fast slide tank 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:18.800
 the insulator will be releasing the second day 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.430
 watch how will take so 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.430
 open or 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:29.169
 demarin still do not use 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:39.470
 run away the most per liter well neatly 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:42.470
 We take out as in those in all 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.210
 insulators uterus edge us with no edge 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.979
 one not another frame no maybe she 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.240
 the middle of the bee 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:54.110
 open the lid neatly so 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.699
 so as not to disturb because from experience 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.909
 we know that as soon as the bees were disturbed 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:05.139
 so the uterus can fly like this 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:13.900
 usually mid mass bee clusters 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:17.289
 neatly remove here is our uterus 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:23.740
 Here we see immediately womb walks 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:26.939
 the very middle here it is the womb of us family 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.939
 now close the hive 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.249
 move all the frames here closer 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:48.399
 so all the frames pushed 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:51.159
 the insulator can be removed eat it pours 

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:55.619
 closing in the evening we will deliver here 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:07:05.439
 on top of the frame here is our hair injection 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:07:09.029
 okay here on this today 

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:09.029
 in the hall all fuck
