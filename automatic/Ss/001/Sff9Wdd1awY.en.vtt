00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:12.020
 today we are on the open sea 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.570
 310 of dufour yachts 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.539
 so this is the new boat that is 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.190
 launched at this Paris fair which is the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.529
 smaller boat of the range that has 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.330
 never been built on on this 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.910
 new cruise range so these 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.779
 boats and and innovative on the fact 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.779
 precisely that it is the smallest 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.270
 boat and we tried to put all 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.710
 the attributes of a boat to a real 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.579
 sailing boat and a boat on which 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.050
 we can do cruising on the 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.580
 outside we can have all 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.180
 necessary equipment there at the 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.660
 navigation 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.150
 so we can have a self-tacking genoa 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.310
 which simplifies the maneuver but we can 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.950
 also have a genoa recovery more 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.530
 classic so what allows to answer 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.930
 to the expectations of a lot of navigation 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.330
 and adapt to the way of navigation and 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.740
 inside it's the same spirit we have 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.180
 wanted to keep a real cruise ship 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.950
 so with a big kitchen with a 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.140
 chart table with a large cabin 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.869
 back of a bathroom that is who 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.390
 is very large and a forward cabin on 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.390
 a 31 feet that is we can close 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.650
 we worked a lot on volumes 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.880
 on board the boat for it to be very 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.650
 nice so we can notice that we have 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.960
 lots of natural light coming in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.210
 in the boat with the porthole 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 panoramic on the red but 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.780
 also the portholes of roosters that are at 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.600
 height when sitting for really 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.420
 have an impression of outside when 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.330
 we are inside the boat so we 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.050
 can live so to 6 people very 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.750
 easily after for navigation 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.580
 as I said in the preamble boat 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 more maneuvering way alone after for 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.990
 people who want to navigate so 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 a little more diligent we can have a 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 genoa recovery we can have everything 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.950
 a whole bunch of equipment that allow 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.470
 to have fun with the boat he navigate 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.470
 crew of four to six people
