00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.670
 and as 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.540
 the astral plane 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.250
 we start with this analysis so 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 expected while end wonders about 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.990
 if there is more life on the planets and due 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 to the influence of the comet he enters 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.390
 a state where it is possible to have a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.670
 astral travel astral travel are 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.489
 supposed detachments of the soul the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.989
 which can travel to different places 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.320
 we can even see ourselves 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.120
 while we are in this state it is fine 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 known that purpose has traveled 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 previously to the astral plane in those 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.650
 occasions was to be able to contact his 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.020
 astral beast and in another to travel the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.480
 pillow world to the land of usa but 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 in this episode we will see him travel to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.229
 through different parts of the earth 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.350
 from the USA in order to see what it is that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.630
 it happens in several locations among them 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 you can see the fox that was seen in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.950
 the episode of five other stories 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 you cut your spiritual representation or 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.240
 astral of it which still has 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.820
 consciousness and it is shown in the series 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.070
 also when mentioning fine rubber we 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.780
 indicates that it was the fox of the episode the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.299
 storytellers 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 with the princess, the jumper 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.619
 that she has a picture with a silhouette 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.960
 human which could have belonged 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 someone who lived previously there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 a reference to the humans of the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.800
 war this because of the silhouette with 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.170
 human form in addition to the objects that 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 you see in it you also have to stand out 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.820
 the panic room which could be 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.190
 used as an anti-bomb shelter since 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.100
 has cupboards with food reserves and 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.950
 canned food even has a 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 camera to see outside something very 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.990
 strange is that passwords do not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850
 coincide they could even say that the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.060
 door can be opened with any 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.920
 four- digit combination though 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.220
 It could also be the case that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.470
 it has more than one combination 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.630
 later we will see simÃ³n in a party the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 which can do ice magic without using 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.530
 the crown this could be a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.840
 contradiction to everything that is known about 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.880
 the crown but it is also known that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.280
 can do ice magic without being a magician 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.170
 since this was seen with the appearance of 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.330
 episode the camera of the knives 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.210
 frosts in which we are 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.280
 jake doing ice magic without owning 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.380
 a crown only the book is used and 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.150
 symbols of brothers although it is also 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.280
 speaks of the wand that the king has 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.860
 ice cream which more than a flag 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.890
 it could be a magical one with which you can 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.170
 make your power ice cold when you finally speak 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.180
 of Simon he refers to the incentive of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 be sad all the time which 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.580
 would be in this case eternal life to 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.070
 change your happiness we will even see 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.090
 then to marcelÃ­n singing very close to 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.310
 where is Simon 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.320
 this makes reference to her 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.710
 he never moves away from him and he always is 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.320
 watching I will be honest with you from 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.940
 that rebecca instead abandoned the show 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.280
 songs by marcelÃ­n looked 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.400
 affected and there are no good songs 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.160
 the series still to date I still do not understand 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.050
 why there is food in space the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.390
 star man refers to him 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.640
 I did not know there were weapons on Mars 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.760
 also wonders against whom 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.010
 would use those weapons showing us so 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.170
 the civilization of Mars could have to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.270
 an old enemy even some 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.090
 participation in some war 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.370
 and he mentions it to the comet and says it is 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.890
 a kind of catalyst agent the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.080
 which is linked to a big change in the 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.570
 civilization by which indicates us that 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.010
 it is strange that it is not yet the date for 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.300
 that this is hit against the earth 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.190
 much less this would crash on Mars 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.830
 this tells us that the real comet 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.230
 which comes every thousand years has not yet arrived 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.180
 to the earth showing so that inside 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.390
 little the comet will crash in the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.910
 planet end refers to the creation of 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.860
 life in how wonderful it is and in 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.080
 how everything brings us to the end 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.850
 inevitable death itself asks 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.650
 if there will be no more in life than just 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.200
 live and die that's why the club 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.829
 He decides to sacrifice in order to save a 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.310
 your civilization 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.310
 ah 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.369
 do not 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 ah
