00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.870
 because here we are again once again 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:11.470
 with the 33 pedal an aluminum base 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.230
 pretty light 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.910
 and this time I'm going to show you 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.779
 how is it that I eat this my pedals 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.470
 now this this is not written in 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.200
 stone 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.710
 every one that fits their pedals this like 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.070
 you find it better if it was not used and 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 I'm going to give you a certain idea here 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.190
 I start with a tuner a stereo tone 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.800
 I have an electronic teaser of politur 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.519
 I sent him to attract truth he has not yet 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.340
 come here 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.180
 costa rica after the tuner 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.290
 I would come 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.330
 my compressor 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.800
 ok I start a taught here with a 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.750
 compressor 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 then I would go directly to the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.180
 filters so to speak used a wow 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.700
 this is a try baby ok after which 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 I'm going to me 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.299
 I do not express 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.040
 ok later I eat it this way to 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.930
 so I find it true then 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.880
 it's just so they have an idea 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.580
 all those who can see this video 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.770
 suddenly they have to adjust to their 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.409
 way your way let's say for this not 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.320
 there is nothing written if there is some basis that 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.700
 one has to follow and others but this 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.750
 it's an idea for you more or less 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.929
 be curious then 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.850
 filter compressor filters here 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.569
 they are one and then came to me not 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.659
 I express my 9 suppressor here where it says 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:50.179
 input would come the cable of the one that comes 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 direct to the field and here here where you say 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.840
 what does it mean to send through light 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.929
 he has here 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.780
 in our meadow I would say my first 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.270
 distortion 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.670
 I would say my main distortion I am 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.620
 talking about the metal football of the mx ok 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:19.379
 input are we send the signal through d 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.310
 my mx be king later I would go to my this 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.099
 overdrive I'm using a full dry 2 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.530
 demos fet then I would go to my other web 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:34.879
 dry I'm using a new cd of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.349
 fulton and here at the end of my chain of 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.170
 distorters and overdrive and of a 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.900
 buster or filter boster knicks this one 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.269
 I still have not arrived yet 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.280
 get then I placed it at the end of 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.379
 my chain this I do more than anything 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 when we are going to start in a single to 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.940
 highlight it and others there are people who 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.260
 used at the beginning but what would 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.549
 is that the distortions and the software 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.040
 betrayed a little harder 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.549
 just here how I like to go to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.650
 end of the chain what I would give you is 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.069
 a little more volume so to speak 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.870
 then of the last pedal in the output 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.260
 would go here to the return and return 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.420
 the other cable would come out here 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.240
 but then around here more or less to 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.910
 have an idea later 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.400
 after the distortions and overdrive 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.930
 and others I always use 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.510
 a facer or that I really like to use 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.189
 in facer after my distortions like that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.860
 it's how I use it suddenly you 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.680
 will use it elsewhere and so on but 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.560
 this is a matter of accommodating it to taste 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.250
 that one wishes these are the pedals of 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.260
 modulation we are talking facer chorus 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.450
 tremolos and others ok then I would follow a 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.720
 chorus as you can see it here 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.379
 because I'm going to accommodate as well as how 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.950
 leave everyone they do not have velcro 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:06.819
 or anything then then I would say my choirs 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.360
 ok and from my choir I would go to my pedal 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.620
 volume 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.620
 to my volume pedal 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:21.690
 ok I want to measure the volume 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:25.050
 of my overdrive and others and my facer and 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.110
 choruses when this part has finished here 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.669
 in the last penalty would be the subject of 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.139
 urbani the euribor ok 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:37.530
 there I would go to the delay in this case 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.040
 I'm using an analog delay 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.300
 we are talking about carbon copy of mx r 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.389
 and then I would go to my new delay of 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.900
 tis and electronics and last 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.820
 they use everything they are rever 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.389
 developers and others and finally I would go 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.400
 this super amazing pedal is the 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.910
 reverbera door 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.080
 blue sky the strain mont this comes with 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.500
 five switches and brings here the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:15.660
 switch to play to run sprint modes 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.180
 it would be normal what is the thinner ok 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.230
 then to do a recount of all 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.870
 my pedal channel here would start with a 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.790
 tuner enters my guitar enters the 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.670
 tuner of my tuner I would go to 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.280
 compressor to compress all the 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.920
 signal would I go to the filters in this case 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.249
 is talking about a one after which 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.829
 I'm going to his prisoner 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:43.409
 decreasing suppressor sends the signal to 

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.460
 through the cen and the return ok that's 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.639
 I explain them in another video 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.340
 miriam a major distortion my 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.009
 overdrive number one overdrive number 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.009
 two and I will like that at the end of 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.759
 booster would tell me to this the pedals of 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:03.970
 modulation that would be a facer after I 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:07.330
 I would go to choirs and choirs I go to my 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.729
 volume pedal and after my pedal 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.740
 of volume I would go to the delay 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.469
 I'm using the delay in this case 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.740
 a coal coke and the new delay and what 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:20.940
 last the reverse 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.789
 this the pedal here what it does is that 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.000
 when you turn off here, they only go to 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.819
 listen to the tails of the delay and the 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.009
 of what is the reverse then this is 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:35.819
 my chain these are my pedals I hope 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:39.060
 that you like those are let's say the 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:42.330
 pedals that I personally like 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.880
 those pedals this one sounds very good 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.220
 they have good sound and so on and they can be 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.130
 do a lot of things with these pedals 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.009
 Now this is an idea that I give you 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.050
 how is it that I eat my pedals like me 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:58.500
 I know that many people accommodate their 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.500
 pedal this as they wish this is 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.199
 totally personal this is to taste 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.030
 of the person if there are people 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.500
 who like chocolate cake 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.720
 others like the strawberry 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.509
 etcetera then this is basically what 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.150
 there are people who like it 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:17.069
 suddenly use the wine after 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.830
 the overdrive so that they colors more 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:21.570
 there are others who use it here 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.340
 if there are things that we have to have very 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.900
 in mind the delay can never go 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.030
 before the overdrive what they have to 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.740
 go completely to the end of the whole chain 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.560
 neither can we put a compressor 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.940
 last because what I would do is 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.620
 fill them all volume and it would be 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.960
 it would be very ugly it sounds very ugly 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.630
 then what are 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.640
 this compressors and filters like weibo 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.830
 fer and others and at the beginning of the chain 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.150
 Same as variable volumes 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.400
 you can accommodate it where you want 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.300
 He cried as here has served me face 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.040
 I walk here and I like it a lot 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.110
 after this one after the distortions 

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.150
 and everything else always goes for me 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.580
 modulation pedals you can 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.830
 accommodate the cdc then there they have 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.050
 boys this is an idea of ​​how they can 

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.330
 accommodate your pedals I hope that you 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.670
 like the video and very soon we will be 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.100
 making reviews of each of the 

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.300
 pedals how they are used as they sound and 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.139
 the rest 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.139
 and many thanks
