00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.330
 garmin 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.539
 Below 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.499
 I have reason to refuse 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.319
 the event 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:14.119
 at 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.119
 7 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.150
 4 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 only I am very honored to welcome this first guitar again 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.850
 when you play a guitar 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.779
 It is therefore important that your guitar is tuned properly 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 and for that you can use polling stations 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.190
 this is one of them 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.810
 that free freestyle 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.770
 wherever that opportunity also order via internet from around 15 euros 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380
 basically all works the same 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.820
 average 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.980
 a witness has cessna de who are going to vote on what you are going to 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.650
 all lights are on 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.630
 with the forest it is so bad that if 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.260
 the butcher catches on 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.460
 we must not point chip must be exactly in the middle 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.500
 now it's back on profit 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.890
 must light up 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.320
 you're a microphone 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.890
 you put the polling room 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 bregje pop 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 the sound box 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.010
 for restricted 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.030
 and so leaves the first heavy and is called the priest 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.660
 whoever is sitting here does not move, so it just stays with the voice buttons 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.030
 until they point you exactly in the downtown area 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.610
 the not the case it is do the corresponding ammunition down 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.020
 it is your first good mood 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.400
 we go to the next one 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.160
 that's the attacks it suggested both the lights are on 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.450
 we state 2 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730
 I don't have to do anything to you 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.640
 according to 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.460
 3 this one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.060
 it good too 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.830
 this already sent in advance 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 and cutting did not provide an internship 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.790
 almost 10 months 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.110
 London 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.430
 that the Breestraat 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.490
 and the newspaper 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.569
 during two strokes of the same name, the ki the mayor 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.789
 apparently 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.969
 the minister 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.459
 The Sergeant names of those samples are very easy to hold, there is room for them 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 this goes as follows 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.059
 agree 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.709
 can fetch 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 So you can get those names that are unfaithful 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.649
 that had happened is hypocritical rude 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:38.909
 the first to finish 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.109
 not to forget must turn over to turn off 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.109
 the damage ends 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.629
 source 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.479
 it was 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.969
 the Hague 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:13.069
 it is
