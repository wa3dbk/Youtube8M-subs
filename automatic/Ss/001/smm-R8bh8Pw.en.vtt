was like it was between 14 and $19 I
can't<00:01:01.350> remember<00:01:01.590> where<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.980> need<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> cup<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
can't remember where you need a cup and

ounces<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.470> water<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.400> ice<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
ounces of water the ice in first and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.530 
ounces of water the ice in first and
then<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> put<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> water<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.090> fluid<00:01:15.360> on

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
then you put the water so it's fluid on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
then you put the water so it's fluid on
some<00:01:15.750> water<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.310> you'll<00:01:17.490> put<00:01:17.700> 2<00:01:18.000> scoops

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of the big training powder mix in there

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.240 
of the big training powder mix in there
so<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.600> go

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.410 

and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.030> put<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> screw<00:01:26.659> on<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:28.610> this

is so cool and you press them and twist
it<00:01:31.880> starts<00:01:32.149> blending<00:01:37.869> okay<00:01:38.869> when<00:01:39.320> it's<00:01:39.440> done

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
it starts blending okay when it's done

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.770 
it starts blending okay when it's done
blending<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.460> want<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.850> use<00:01:41.030> your<00:01:41.330> favorite
