00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello to you whether you are in this video x 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.889
 we'll talk about tank tenth 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.410
 level france 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 more tello 25t what about myself 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 represents butt in fact it's there 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.980
 support and if you draw an analogy 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.699
 other popular games in the reports 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 ninja which is quickly small elusive thing 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.080
 the main damager who appears so 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.039
 as suddenly as a ninja puts on a series 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.550
 most powerful blows 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.669
 average damage drum of 5 shells is equal to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.110
 1950 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 which is enough to destroy 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 almost any car in the game namely 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 any car up to level nine 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 inclusive as well as a number of cars of level 10 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.360
 whose capacity is less than 1950 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.670
 units but due to the fact that the drum 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 us discharged in 10 seconds without 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.309
 information when used correctly 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.850
 honor makes it almost 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.289
 unpunished armor bochata no our 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 protection is our speed 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.270
 small size and large tilt angles 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.609
 front armor plates these angles 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.630
 sometimes they do such wonders that even myself 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.490
 sometimes you wonder in this passage on 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 clearly see that even the shells of e100 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 can easily ricoche from bochat armor 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 once again slow motion playback 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.820
 It is worth noting that this tool 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.100
 used e100 diameter 150 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 millimeters 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.860
 thanks to the drum we can easily 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.299
 destroy several artillery 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 cars in a very short span 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.049
 time with a new patch in which 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.110
 the number of units of artillery strength 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.400
 was reduced it became even easier 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.140
 here the most important thing is to understand that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.820
 stop in front of artillery stands 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.080
 only if it is not on you 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.060
 eaten 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 many people mistakenly believe that 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.740
 this is the active light first tank 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.300
 it is a damager and after that the light is definitely 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.130
 the barrel should shine but that way 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.650
 so as not to lose 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.750
 machine namely use the cob 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.060
 passive light is enough for this 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.840
 drive up the bushes and just look at them 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.760
 but do not shoot start to notice 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.290
 the case if the opponent is 400 or 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.040
 More meters you can afford 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.990
 fire 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.090
 but if you are sure of something nearby 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.550
 no opponent with stereo tube 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.570
 or coated optics 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.510
 you can also use a small 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.830
 trick to drive off a few meters from 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.959
 bush to become 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.430
 opaque and fire with 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.650
 certain confidence that the opponent 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.810
 you will not notice as a disguise on you 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.400
 will be much more than that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.709
 if cous is transparent to you 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 as regards masking bochata 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.930
 it is safe to say that she has 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.510
 he is one of the best namely when 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.300
 batchat stands motionless his disguise 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.410
 equal to 17 and a half percent movement 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.190
 same 12 and a half and at the time of the shot 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 354 what is on a par with the t-62a best 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.390
 performance among classmates for 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.450
 except that the moment of the shot 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.850
 masking bochata compared with t-62a 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.660
 less but it is clear because the caliber of 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.370
 us higher 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.940
 therefore deal damage per shot 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.470
 more times we touched the topic of comparison with 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.140
 classmates let's talk this 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.180
 the topic is more detailed on these tablets we 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.830
 clearly see that butt possesses 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.580
 least strength among 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.190
 classmates 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.380
 the best power density i.e. 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.950
 engine power to mass ratio 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.280
 tank 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.530
 better top speed worst 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.690
 turning speed full absence 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.330
 any armor and quite 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.570
 satisfactory viewing range 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.490
 now compare the characteristics of weapons 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.170
 the table shows that we have the most 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.750
 smallest rate of fire but this and 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.370
 no matter because we have the same average drum 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.530
 armor penetration is slightly inferior 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.030
 other machines but cumulative 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.500
 shells our armor penetration 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.290
 second only to the newest tank 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.640
 Chinese damage per shot can be 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
 say that we possess quite 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.780
 normal performance level 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.340
 other machines except again 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.290
 Chinese 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.250
 With regards to the time information, 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.560
 say with confidence 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.030
 it is terrible on their teach indicator among 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.120
 all medium tanks of the tenth level 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.810
 on a par with the Chinese also 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.440
 say about the angles of vertical guidance 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.360
 they are equal to minus 6i + 11 degrees what 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.440
 certainly a small value of y 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.590
 far from the worst 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.049
 yet the instrument we have is lowered in contrast 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.260
 from the Chinese tank and now 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.240
 talk about crew skills if by 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.920
 some not certain reasons you have 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.710
 there was no pumped crew 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.870
 first skills take repair and after 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.419
 of how to pump up to at least 70 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.760
 percent 2 perk do the reset and take 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.490
 6 felt the commander vindictive 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.560
 gunner and karabis more expensive at the mechvod he 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.419
 remaining at least 70 percent 2 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.970
 skill take repair without need 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.110
 do have one hundred percent of this skill 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.390
 commanders wife sixth sense can 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.830
 reset immediately further press skills 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.470
 and I recommend everyone to take combat 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.100
 fraternity disguise and only then 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.480
 smooth rotation of the tower with the smooth running and 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.500
 also do not forget about the jack of all trades 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.120
 the commander who is very helpful 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.020
 now move on to equipment selection 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.669
 us classic 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.330
 vertical alignment stabilizer 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.930
 fan and optics and the last thing i'm talking about 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.729
 I will tell you 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.680
 small tricks which practically 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.419
 nobody uses 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.000
 since bochata has a back arrangement 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.820
 towers you must use effectively 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.009
 this is an example leaving carmack shelter so 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.199
 the way you see on this video 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.449
 using this trick allows 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.820
 us to get what we get 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.520
 much more difficult as part of the machine 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.020
 visible to the enemy is much less and in 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.660
 If we urgently need 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.910
 leave from the position we will do it 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.009
 much easier than if we stand 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.680
 I also want to give you one piece of advice 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.449
 always go to recharge the drum with 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.259
 using the c key at the first 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.400
 opportunities 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.470
 it will allow you to be completely 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.680
 charged at the meeting with the enemy and 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.660
 not to have a shortage of shells until new 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.130
 meetings dear viewers forget 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.080
 subscribe to the channel and join 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.270
 group vkontakte in the future waiting for you 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.710
 a lot of interesting video guides and 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.710
 all that concerns tanks
