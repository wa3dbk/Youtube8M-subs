00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
am playing on steam which is obviously

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.560 
am playing on steam which is obviously
different<00:00:52.610> from<00:00:52.910> what<00:00:53.000> I'm<00:00:53.090> usually<00:00:53.239> playing

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570

different from what I'm usually playing
on<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:53.809> 360<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.620> actually<00:00:55.250> got<00:00:55.550> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
on the 360 I actually got the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.190 
on the 360 I actually got the
achievement<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.239> had<00:00:56.450> a<00:00:56.480> problem<00:00:56.750> with<00:00:56.930> fraps

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
achievement and had a problem with fraps

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.260

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
so i redid it and you won't see the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.700 
so i redid it and you won't see the
notification<00:00:59.510> come<00:01:00.020> up<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:00.230> i<00:01:00.290> can<00:01:00.500> guarantee

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
notification come up but i can guarantee

you<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.850> does<00:01:02.090> work<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.750> hundred<00:01:02.989> percent

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
you that it does work a hundred percent

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.620 
you that it does work a hundred percent
of<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.350> time<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.999> just<00:01:04.999> actually<00:01:05.269> does<00:01:05.479> work

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
after a while I did skip out about 15

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.399 
after a while I did skip out about 15
seconds<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.219> their<00:01:22.310> conversation<00:01:23.229> this<00:01:24.229> guy

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
seconds in their conversation this guy

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.840 
seconds in their conversation this guy
that's<00:01:24.619> closer<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.219> you<00:01:25.310> will<00:01:25.429> actually<00:01:25.670> turn

that's closer to you will actually turn

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.879 
that's closer to you will actually turn
around<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.389> inspect<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.869> control<00:01:27.289> box<00:01:27.560> on

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
around and inspect the control box on

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.459 
around and inspect the control box on
the<00:01:28.069> wall<00:01:28.100> he'll<00:01:28.880> do<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.209> for<00:01:29.450> additional<00:01:29.899> 15

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
the wall he'll do that for additional 15

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.099 
the wall he'll do that for additional 15
to<00:01:30.649> 20<00:01:30.950> seconds<00:01:31.340> let's<00:01:31.909> skip<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.659> little<00:01:32.990> bit

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
to 20 seconds let's skip a little bit

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.839 
to 20 seconds let's skip a little bit
through<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.709> too<00:01:34.009> as<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:34.399> pretty<00:01:34.700> much

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
through that too as it's pretty much
