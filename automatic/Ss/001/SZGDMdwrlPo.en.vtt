nice and even don't let it wrap around

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.690 
nice and even don't let it wrap around
itself<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:38.110> once<00:02:38.350> you've<00:02:38.560> dried<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:39.550> much

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
itself so once you've dried it as much

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.370 
itself so once you've dried it as much
as<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.450> air<00:02:40.750> drying<00:02:41.050> very

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
as you can and this is air drying very

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.160 
as you can and this is air drying very
fast<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:42.670> alcohol<00:02:43.090> will<00:02:43.300> dissipate<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.900> 30

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
fast this alcohol will dissipate in 30

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.560 
fast this alcohol will dissipate in 30
seconds<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.710> minute<00:02:44.860> at<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.130> most<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:46.300> can<00:02:46.420> put

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
seconds a minute at the most you can put

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.320 
seconds a minute at the most you can put
this<00:02:46.690> back<00:02:46.750> together<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:48.340> you've<00:02:49.120> got

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
we use to get it started with on little

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400 
we use to get it started with on little
rag<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.330> rosin<00:03:10.720> wipe<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.050> in<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.260> get<00:03:11.350> it

rag a little rosin wipe it in to get it

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.080 
rag a little rosin wipe it in to get it
started<00:03:11.770> it's<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.430> good<00:03:12.580> way<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.790> get<00:03:12.940> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
started it's a good way to get the

started it's a good way to get the
immediate<00:03:13.570> rosin<00:03:14.170> into<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> hair<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:16.270> can

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
immediate rosin into the hair you can

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.450 
immediate rosin into the hair you can
take<00:03:16.690> rosin<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.230> enough<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.280> it'll

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
take rosin it enough and it'll

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.780 
take rosin it enough and it'll
eventually<00:03:18.640> be<00:03:19.330> fine<00:03:19.600> so<00:03:20.320> once<00:03:20.560> again<00:03:20.790> you've

no<00:03:24.610> dirt<00:03:24.850> no<00:03:25.090> grease<00:03:25.360> it's<00:03:25.600> great<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:27.340> can't

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
no dirt no grease it's great you can't

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.650 
no dirt no grease it's great you can't
do<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.850> too<00:03:28.030> many<00:03:28.180> times<00:03:28.270> because

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
do that too many times because

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.420 
do that too many times because
ultimately<00:03:29.020> it<00:03:29.380> will<00:03:29.500> dry<00:03:29.770> out<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:30.130> hair<00:03:30.310> if

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
ultimately it will dry out the hair if

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.640 
ultimately it will dry out the hair if
you<00:03:30.520> soak<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:30.940> alcohol<00:03:31.090> over<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.660> over<00:03:31.840> but

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
you soak it in alcohol over and over but

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.070 
you soak it in alcohol over and over but
just<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.610> good<00:03:33.790> way<00:03:33.940> in<00:03:34.180> an<00:03:34.270> emergency<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.750> save
