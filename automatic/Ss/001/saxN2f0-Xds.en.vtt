the teeth that Invisalign needs to move

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
the teeth that Invisalign needs to move
them<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> flat<00:00:29.310> surface

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
them because if you have a flat surface

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.060 
them because if you have a flat surface
which<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.300> tooth<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:31.260> glue<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> little

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.040 
which is your tooth we glue on a little
attachment<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.969> helps<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> move<00:00:33.750> things

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
attachment and that helps to move things

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
attachment and that helps to move things
around<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.190> full<00:00:35.940> movement
