update on the gy6 ADCC big bore traffic
dog<00:00:09.000> scooters<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:11.480> opened<00:00:12.480> up<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> ring

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
dog scooters I opened up the ring

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.070 
dog scooters I opened up the ring
package<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> check<00:00:14.160> those<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:15.020> but<00:00:16.020> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
package just to check those out but I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.550 
package just to check those out but I
guess<00:00:16.529> I'll<00:00:16.710> start<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:18.420> actual<00:00:18.869> sleeve

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
guess I'll start with the actual sleeve

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.050 
guess I'll start with the actual sleeve
first<00:00:22.560> glance<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.789> nice

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
first glance it's actually really nice

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
first glance it's actually really nice
it<00:00:24.990> uh<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:27.150> haven't<00:00:27.599> found<00:00:28.019> any<00:00:28.289> casting<00:00:28.859> flaws

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it uh I haven't found any casting flaws

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.270 
it uh I haven't found any casting flaws
it's<00:00:30.000> very<00:00:30.300> smooth<00:00:33.649> it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> forty<00:00:34.980> seven

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it's very smooth it's a forty seven

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.700 
it's very smooth it's a forty seven
millimeter<00:00:35.670> diameter<00:00:36.420> piston<00:00:38.210> original<00:00:39.210> is

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
millimeter diameter piston original is

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.000 
millimeter diameter piston original is
41<00:00:40.710> gy6<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.670> believe<00:00:44.510> it's<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> DCC<00:00:46.800> big

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
41 gy6 as I believe it's it is a DCC big

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.959 
41 gy6 as I believe it's it is a DCC big
bore<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> does<00:00:48.210> say<00:00:48.420> 49<00:00:48.809> cc<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> side

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
bore but it does say 49 cc on the side

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.600 
bore but it does say 49 cc on the side
and<00:00:52.789> I<00:00:53.789> kinda<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.690> confused<00:00:55.199> about<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.800> but

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and I kinda was confused about that but

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.500 
and I kinda was confused about that but
uh<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.840> anyway<00:00:58.379> because<00:00:59.390> just<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
uh I like it anyway because just the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
uh I like it anyway because just the
fact<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.020> no<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:01.770> ever<00:01:02.010> be

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
fact that no one will really ever be

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.509 
fact that no one will really ever be
able<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> tell<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:04.040> DCC<00:01:05.040> big<00:01:05.280> bore

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
able to tell that is a DCC big bore

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570 
able to tell that is a DCC big bore
unless<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.360> try<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> compare<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.260> stock<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
unless you try to compare a stock and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.940 
unless you try to compare a stock and
then<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> actual<00:01:09.420> 80<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.650> stock

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
then the actual 80 this is the stock

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.270 
then the actual 80 this is the stock
that's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.490> 40<00:01:11.790> millimeter<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> DCC

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that's a 40 millimeter this is the a DCC

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.590 
that's a 40 millimeter this is the a DCC
big<00:01:14.490> war<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> 47<00:01:16.970> here's<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> piston

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
big war which is a 47 here's the piston

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.990 
big war which is a 47 here's the piston
and<00:01:19.970> as<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.700> trying<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> sit

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and as you can see this is trying to sit

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.429 
and as you can see this is trying to sit
as<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.840> flush<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.150> mean<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.869> big

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
as as flush as it can I mean it's as big

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
as as flush as it can I mean it's as big
as<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.009> bore<00:01:29.700> itself<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.880> pretty<00:01:36.090> nice

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
as the bore itself so it's pretty nice

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.380 
as the bore itself so it's pretty nice
it's<00:01:37.200> uh<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:38.430> nice<00:01:38.610> quality<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it's uh really nice quality for the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.249 
it's uh really nice quality for the
money<00:01:40.880> when<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> open<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> base

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
money when you open it up you get a base

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.679 
money when you open it up you get a base
gasket<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> head<00:01:44.189> gasket<00:01:47.149> get<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.390> sear

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
gasket in the head gasket get your sear

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.190 
gasket in the head gasket get your sear
clips<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:54.210> Gunjan<00:01:54.990> pin

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
clips and then you get your Gunjan pin

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.130 
clips and then you get your Gunjan pin
or<00:01:55.560> wrist<00:01:55.890> pin<00:01:58.640> i<00:01:59.640> actually<00:02:00.149> went<00:02:00.570> ahead<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
or wrist pin i actually went ahead to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.359 
or wrist pin i actually went ahead to
open<00:02:02.689> up<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.469> actual<00:02:06.649> piston<00:02:07.649> ring<00:02:07.860> package

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
open up the actual piston ring package

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.369 
open up the actual piston ring package
for<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> piston

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
for the piston

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.629 
for the piston
and<00:02:11.249> comes<00:02:11.519> with<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:12.709> darker<00:02:13.709> colored<00:02:14.099> ring<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:14.639 
and comes with a darker colored ring I

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.239 
and comes with a darker colored ring I
believe<00:02:15.480> that's<00:02:15.659> for<00:02:15.719> the<00:02:15.900> bass<00:02:16.249> compression

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.249 
believe that's for the bass compression

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.989 
believe that's for the bass compression
get<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.569> bass<00:02:18.719> compression<00:02:19.319> ring<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.790> this

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:20.999 
get a the bass compression ring and this

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.149 
get a the bass compression ring and this
is<00:02:21.180> for<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> top<00:02:21.749> compression<00:02:22.319> ring<00:02:22.909> silver

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
is for the top compression ring silver

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.569 
is for the top compression ring silver
you<00:02:26.159> have<00:02:26.280> your<00:02:26.370> oil<00:02:26.400> scraper<00:02:28.040> your<00:02:29.040> two<00:02:29.280> rings

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
you have your oil scraper your two rings

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.490 
you have your oil scraper your two rings
for<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.879> oil<00:02:30.090> scraper<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.840> top<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.230> bottom

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.800 
for the oil scraper and top and bottom
of<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.950> won't<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.670> able<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.060> do<00:02:33.689> an

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
of it I won't be able to do an

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.199 
of it I won't be able to do an
installation<00:02:34.260> video<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.129> because<00:02:36.030> I

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
installation video on this because I

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.379 
installation video on this because I
don't<00:02:36.239> actually<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.989> stand<00:02:37.409> for<00:02:37.739> this

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
don't actually have a stand for this

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.569 
don't actually have a stand for this
camera<00:02:39.469> so<00:02:40.469> I'll<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.739> able<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:41.040> show<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.459> what

camera so I'll be able to show you what
it<00:02:41.760> looks<00:02:41.939> like<00:02:42.379> in<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.590> next<00:02:43.769> video<00:02:44.189> when<00:02:45.000> I'm

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it looks like in the next video when I'm

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.789 
it looks like in the next video when I'm
installing<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:47.449> it's<00:02:48.449> really<00:02:48.870> nice<00:02:49.019> quality<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
installing it it's really nice quality I

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.959 
installing it it's really nice quality I
haven't<00:02:50.579> seen<00:02:50.790> any<00:02:52.310> casting<00:02:53.310> flaws<00:02:53.609> on<00:02:53.849> this

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
haven't seen any casting flaws on this

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.500 
haven't seen any casting flaws on this
at<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.299> unlike<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.560> stock<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:57.150> really

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
