the<00:00:21.150> fees<00:00:21.330> there's<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.840> ton<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> different<00:00:22.289> ways

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the fees there's a ton of different ways

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.170 
the fees there's a ton of different ways
of<00:00:22.740> doing<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.460> find<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.970> one

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of doing this but I find this one

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
of doing this but I find this one
probably<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.900> most<00:00:25.050> easiest<00:00:25.470> way<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.039> it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
probably the most easiest way and it's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820 
probably the most easiest way and it's
pretty<00:00:26.490> simple<00:00:26.930> not<00:00:27.930> too<00:00:28.109> much<00:00:28.289> work<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.710> be

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
pretty simple not too much work to be

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
pretty simple not too much work to be
done<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> CD<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.260> let's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
done just like the CD up really so let's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.080 
done just like the CD up really so let's
get<00:00:31.590> started<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.460> need<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> do

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
get started so what we need to do

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
get started so what we need to do
it's<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.800> activated<00:00:34.800> drugs<00:00:35.100> obviously<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it's just activated drugs obviously a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.069 
it's just activated drugs obviously a
virtual<00:00:35.969> machine<00:00:36.829> restart<00:00:37.829> machine<00:00:38.780> like<00:00:39.780> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
virtual machine restart machine like so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
virtual machine restart machine like so
I<00:00:42.079> think<00:00:43.079> won't<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.500> matter<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:44.100> what

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I think won't really matter what what

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.310 
I think won't really matter what what
actual<00:00:45.239> password<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.200> because

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
actual password is on there because

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990 
actual password is on there because
we're<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.829> resetting<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.670> new

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
we're going to be resetting it to a new

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.740 
we're going to be resetting it to a new
password<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> let<00:00:50.100> me<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.460> load<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.149> piece

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
password so let me just load this piece

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
password so let me just load this piece
of<00:00:51.930> software<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:52.980> starting

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of software as you can see it's starting

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
of software as you can see it's starting
to<00:00:53.370> load<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> wind<00:00:54.120> tunnels<00:00:54.570> erd

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

commander 2005 it's been around quite a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.560 
commander 2005 it's been around quite a
while<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.590> still<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:58.980> handy<00:00:59.570> for

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
while but it's still pretty handy for

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
while but it's still pretty handy for
certain<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.230> jobs<00:01:04.519> there's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> ton<00:01:05.820> of

certain little jobs there's a ton of

certain little jobs there's a ton of
other<00:01:06.030> software<00:01:06.360> news<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.470> use

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
other software news you can use

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
other software news you can use
Trinity<00:01:09.090> rescue<00:01:09.869> CD<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
Trinity rescue CD that's one of them and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
Trinity rescue CD that's one of them and
there's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.479> few<00:01:12.990> Linux<00:01:13.320> versions<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
there's a few Linux versions that you

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.179 
there's a few Linux versions that you
can<00:01:14.369> use<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.509> mean<00:01:16.470> pretty<00:01:16.799> much<00:01:16.890> they

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
can use as well I mean pretty much they

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
can use as well I mean pretty much they
all<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> same<00:01:17.549> thing<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.540> bit

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
all do the same thing some of them a bit

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
all do the same thing some of them a bit
more<00:01:18.900> complicated<00:01:19.229> than<00:01:19.650> others<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.549> find<00:01:21.360> it's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
more complicated than others I find it's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
more complicated than others I find it's
fun<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> most<00:01:21.930> simplest<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.130> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
fun the most simplest way to use it so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.020 
fun the most simplest way to use it so
that's<00:01:24.479> why<00:01:24.750> I'm<00:01:24.840> showing<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> today<00:01:26.030> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that's why I'm showing you it today so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880 
that's why I'm showing you it today so
let<00:01:27.180> me<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.479> let<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.900> load<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.770> we

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
let me just let this load in and then we

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700 
let me just let this load in and then we
can<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:30.390> shop<00:01:30.659> quickly<00:01:30.810> resetting<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
can get on to shop quickly resetting it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.510 
can get on to shop quickly resetting it
takes<00:01:31.979> literally<00:01:32.430> minutes<00:01:33.079> to<00:01:34.079> load<00:01:34.229> up

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.920 

okay<00:01:38.520> we're<00:01:38.729> nearly<00:01:38.909> loud<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:39.600> I'm

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
okay we're nearly loud you in now I'm

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.780 
okay we're nearly loud you in now I'm
just<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> skip<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.950> part<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.579> don't

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
just going to skip this part so we don't

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.740 
just going to skip this part so we don't
want<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.229> let<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> network<00:01:43.530> configuration

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
now what we're do is see if we can load

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.080 
now what we're do is see if we can load
up<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.409> machine<00:02:52.799> what<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> need<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.879> just

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
up the machine what I need to do is just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.000 
up the machine what I need to do is just
get<00:02:54.269> out<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.629> bit<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.079> have<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.409> do<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.739> stuff

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
get out this bit I have to do that stuff

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.300 
get out this bit I have to do that stuff
and<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.519> and<00:03:00.709> change<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.920> drive

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and get out and change the drive

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.039 
and get out and change the drive
otherwise<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.909> will<00:03:03.090> try<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.420> load<00:03:03.840> this

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
otherwise it will try to load this

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:14.809 
otherwise it will try to load this
software<00:03:05.040> up<00:03:05.280> again<00:03:05.629> log<00:03:06.629> off<00:03:13.549> can<00:03:14.549> actually

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
software up again log off can actually

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.729 
software up again log off can actually
probably<00:03:15.060> reset<00:03:15.569> restart<00:03:15.810> actually<00:03:16.590> all

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
probably reset restart actually all

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.400 
probably reset restart actually all
reset<00:03:17.129> they'll<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.549> ok<00:03:20.870> there'd<00:03:21.870> windows<00:03:22.260> up

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
reset they'll be ok there'd windows up

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:33.400 
reset they'll be ok there'd windows up
and<00:03:30.049> then<00:03:31.049> going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.349> bright<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.889> type<00:03:32.669> test

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
and then going to bright it type test

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.099 
and then going to bright it type test
pushing<00:03:34.410> up<00:03:34.669> member<00:03:35.669> in<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.720> quick<00:03:36.930> I

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
pushing up member in is that quick I

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.449 
pushing up member in is that quick I
think<00:03:37.139> that's<00:03:37.530> probably<00:03:37.709> one<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.190> easiest

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
think that's probably one of the easiest

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.800 
think that's probably one of the easiest
ways<00:03:38.699> to<00:03:38.910> do<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.239> be<00:03:39.329> honest

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
ways to do it to be honest

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.020 
ways to do it to be honest
