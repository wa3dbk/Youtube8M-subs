flash<00:01:14.760> drive<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.320> needs<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> talk

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
flash drive here and it needs to talk

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.140 
flash drive here and it needs to talk
together<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.430> motherboard<00:01:17.880> needs<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
together the motherboard needs to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.429 
together the motherboard needs to
communicate<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.780> everything<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.350> they

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
communicate to everything so they

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.830 
communicate to everything so they
created<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.430> insanely<00:01:21.000> high<00:01:21.540> speed

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
created this just insanely high speed

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929 
created this just insanely high speed
cable<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> connecting<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> docks

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
cable that is connecting when it docks

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
cable that is connecting when it docks
and<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.390> accomplishes<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.500> goal<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.890> making

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and that accomplishes the goal of making

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
and that accomplishes the goal of making
sure<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.549> everything's<00:01:26.939> fluid<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> real

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sure that everything's fluid like a real

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
sure that everything's fluid like a real
laptop<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.280> you're<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
laptop so what you're going to do is you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.569 
laptop so what you're going to do is you
have<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.290> little<00:01:31.590> lever<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> side<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
have this little lever on the side and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.840 
have this little lever on the side and
when<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.759> disconnect<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
when you disconnect it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.310 
when you disconnect it
notice<00:01:35.850> Kate<00:01:36.000> doesn't<00:01:36.240> make<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.450> sound<00:01:36.689> but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
notice Kate doesn't make that sound but

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
notice Kate doesn't make that sound but
you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.890> Windows<00:01:38.250> 8<00:01:38.430> system<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you have your Windows 8 system here you

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.260 
you have your Windows 8 system here you
have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> full<00:01:39.869> functioning<00:01:40.530> Windows<00:01:41.159> 8<00:01:41.369> tablet

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
have a full functioning Windows 8 tablet

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.569 
have a full functioning Windows 8 tablet
so<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.369> full

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so when you're on the go you have full

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.550 
so when you're on the go you have full
power<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.270> 128<00:01:45.810> gigs<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> flash<00:01:46.530> storage

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
power you have 128 gigs of flash storage

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.980 
power you have 128 gigs of flash storage
so<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.189> crazy<00:01:47.430> fast<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> come

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so it's crazy fast and when you come

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
so it's crazy fast and when you come
