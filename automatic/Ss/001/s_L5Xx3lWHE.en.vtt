00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770

he's<00:02:03.920> got<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.340> use<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.789> rest

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:30.390 

and<00:02:13.410> there's<00:02:13.710> no<00:02:13.920> alternative

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.309 

far<00:02:31.400> enough<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:34.459> demands<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.390> really<00:02:36.110> good

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
far enough this demands a really good

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.520 
far enough this demands a really good
shot<00:02:39.670> yes<00:02:40.670> he's<00:02:40.910> got<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.360> pop<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.110> green<00:02:42.350> this

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
shot yes he's got to pop the green this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.020 
shot yes he's got to pop the green this
time<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.800> think<00:02:42.980> go<00:02:43.340> all<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.580> way<00:02:43.610> around<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
time I think go all the way around the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.680 
time I think go all the way around the
table<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.250> angle<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.370> there<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:47.000> he'll

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
table so the angle is there but he'll

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.330 
table so the angle is there but he'll
need<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> little<00:02:48.590> bit<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.800> luck<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.130> get<00:02:49.220> on
