00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 1 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290
 1 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.410
 Hello 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.870
 you learn a simple song 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.250
 she's called aaron winger so 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.400
 you just need three agreements 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.590
 which a bar and therefore first agreement is 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.940
 the minor is like that so first 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.090
 rope we play it in the void 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.280
 second rope hello the first party 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.580
 then you have to play with the ring finger 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 the third string second party is 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.740
 finally finished with the major in the 4th 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.600
 second strings made as I am then 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.170
 you must not play the game 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.570
 first rope 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.800
 so that's why we're going slightly 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.740
 to put his thumb so that we can not 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.930
 then hear the second agreement 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.780
 it's the same thing that we have 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.759
 always shown of a dune charge of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.940
 body like these and we will remove 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.369
 the index so that gives us fourth 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.190
 strings second fred singer second 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:42.229
 party and en bloc lightly with the thumb 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.030
 as subject then the barrel so for 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.390
 those that it's going to do the same you have to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.820
 really have brute force in the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.049
 Bread is like not having asked 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.690
 the finger like these one closest to 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.680
 the metal bar without being on it if we 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.610
 did not hear as if and then you 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.960
 go add your fingers like this so 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.940
 it gives first first strong 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.620
 first ford first his mother strawberries 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.450
 second ford 12th freight third rope 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.910
 third rope second cargo fourth 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.050
 rope 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.720
 4th ropes third cargo 5th horns 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.720
 Third Freight 6th Ropes First Freight 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.650
 so for the part with mx 2 5 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.230
 you have to play each chord a thousand times 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.230
 with them discovered down like this 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.170
 then the group am of love 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.440
 the two months it gives but 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 me 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.140
 this is for the first part then 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.709
 you have to play I join you one thing 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.100
 but after the m you have to do the f 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.100
 you know 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.230
 hu 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.420
 Then I lift him up 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.840
 must really forget to do 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.420
 master the thumb for my case okay the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.710
 sixth camp otherwise it'll give a 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.340
 tone too serious 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.340
