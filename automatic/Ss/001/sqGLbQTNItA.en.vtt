00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:10.340
 Hi there, this is a story about how I am 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.340
 repaired Hector; the kettle disassembled it 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.279
 next story 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.189
 it means only the kettle stopped boiling 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.090
 water as we see it rector chan 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.599
 on a disk heating element like 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 rule if it fails then 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.350
 such a kettle can be thrown out 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.350
 because these shadows where they are sold 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 it is impossible to replace them 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 what I did to start to start you need 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.530
 ring out 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.380
 the button I started and the old man though needed 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.920
 check circuit year of outlet 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.470
 connection to the site that I Dummies 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.970
 did not i was sure that this is a playground 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.110
 it works fine for me 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:04.660
 that from the outlet is completely voltage on 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:10.300
 pad but read about it I did 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:12.500
 missed this step hershel following step 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.330
 which should be the second number 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.120
 first I started checking the button button 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.030
 it turned out the whole is that check button 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.710
 ira need to call for this purpose at me here 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.240
 see blue with white contact 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.100
 here we connect the method and check the blue 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.960
 knocked down check resistance is desirable 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.200
 it's all connected 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.390
 show resistance you need to be 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.570
 low something less o mom ferry it 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.470
 it is important to show a short circuit further 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.869
 also all this fiber make-up santim 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.930
 tan must have resistance 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.170
 thirty to forty he if there is no resistance 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.649
 generally means the pace is my channel now 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.659
 brought us means it burned out 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.159
 if it burned out at least not be subject to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.630
 just throwing out the teapots kids 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.380
 buy new if there is a whole 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.550
 there is another problem unscrew this 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.060
 there is an extra pad inside 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.000
 button that's how it is here only it already 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.110
 open here, we covered it here 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.940
 open and she passes through the thermal grease 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 she connects to this site 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.880
 if for some reason the first button 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.739
 you do not work then for a little more 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.900
 high temperatures triggered 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.980
 the second button which is difficult down there 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.209
 thermal paste is usually dries up 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.970
 split check if thermal grease 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.810
 supra and grease posts 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.220
 need to work out a click but as a rule 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.920
 if this button does not work sadder 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.440
 past and and this here and the buttons do not work 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.480
 and not just stop turning it on 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.000
 will boil work in my life 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.510
 clearing Nicolas did not turn on this light 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.810
 did not catch fire turned out to be much easier 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.870
 about the old man all plundered our all here 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.519
 works 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.069
 i started checking him why they 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.000
 voltage comes here I measured the cheese 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.370
 I get a tension on you 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 it turned out that the problem is inside 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:31.390
 there are toys here 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.090
 spring-loaded balls these spring-loaded 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.110
 balls touch these metal 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.420
 contacts 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.560
 so here is one of these balls not 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.819
 spring loaded 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.569
 didn't rotate just drowned in there and 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.220
 it turns out that he did not touch and 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.329
 let's say 0 and the phase just didn't have 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:56.519
 kettle and he did not boil now i can 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:02.220
 this is the ball in place it has become spring loaded in 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.220
 As a result, the kettle began to be fixed on and 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:18.060
 started working kettle work 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.410
 I hope to tell you the verification scheme 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.240
 useful to repair 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.760
 comfortable kettle do not forget first 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.889
 check whether it comes completely 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.470
 the voltage on the site and then interfere 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.090
 disassemble the kettle start the carriage button 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.040
 tn and optional 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 have a clerk to everyone while drinking tea 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:47.940
 as often as possible as delicious as possible and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.919
 useful subscribe to my channel or 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.919
 put the thumbs up of the world go up 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.919
 until 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.470
