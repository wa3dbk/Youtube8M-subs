00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
a triple on my own for 3 hopefully if

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
a triple on my own for 3 hopefully if
that's<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.200> rage<00:01:22.409> inducing<00:01:22.619> which<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.430> don't

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that's not rage inducing which I don't

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.920 
that's not rage inducing which I don't
think<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> should<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> last<00:01:24.570> time<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
think it should because the last time it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
think it should because the last time it
was<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> first<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.650> played<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.090> you
