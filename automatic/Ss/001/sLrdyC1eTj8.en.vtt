00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 first brutal infos from the new dom 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.290
 first game scenes from the new project 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.420
 zero and the official notice 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.400
 hammer at microsoft I'm erwin 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 Lotter one million years old and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 these are the news you have in advance 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.609
 Software had announced on the quake 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 con finally the new duo unveiled this 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.300
 does not mean no more doom 4 but 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 just stupid and based on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.559
 the new i tech engine six the the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.210
 developers jokingly call etec 666 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.980
 I would like to make you one now 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 lots of game scenes actually show 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 has is and at firm these things 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.040
 but only to the visitors of the quake con 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 shown it even goes so far as you can 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 the audience of the livestreams easy 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 thrown out in the middle of it that is 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.009
 I try to explain that now 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.930
 with pictures from the old play that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 fits very well because in the new tomb 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.270
 you play a soldier again with the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.369
 you slip back on the mars and there 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 a lot of other demons are also traipsing 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 a lot around 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.960
 So it's a kind of new beginning again 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.340
 as with dhoom 3 was for the whole 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.290
 Nevertheless, there is a series 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.850
 actually something completely new and not only 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.979
 warmed up and that is mainly 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.090
 what my new team with his 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.500
 can make hands 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990
 they are no longer just for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 cling to weapons but also for ultra 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 brutal melee finishing moves 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.259
 You can also do it with a jetpack 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.180
 Do a double jump and yourself 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.490
 to higher platforms 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.960
 pull up and then hands on 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.299
 The third one is used now 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.229
 also to solve puzzles and namely to 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.390
 a fingerprint scanner 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.670
 To get past one just goes to one 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.950
 dead scientist ravishes him 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.489
 whole arm out and stops 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.989
 the hand similar to the button 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.330
 as in the new wolfenstein there are 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.400
 moreover, no full car much 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 more but everywhere in the level stains 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.569
 health items rum like you 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.840
 you have to pick it up because otherwise you can 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.510
 going 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.630
 Now for pc playstation 4 and xbox 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.069
 one will appear sometime in 2015 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.620
 So there is a concrete date 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.870
 not of me but now the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.580
 ask you how do you like it? 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.349
 and just fix the game behind 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.000
 have shown locked doors 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.000
 please write in the comments 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.519
 significantly more scenes than none at all 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.010
 as with the ghosts 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.540
 photo continuation project zero 5 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.519
 Namely in the first trailer 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.560
 shown that again by techno coly 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.730
 comes this time but exclusively for the wii 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.709
 u will appear 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.459
 in japan there is already one for that 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.230
 27 september for europa white 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.829
 but not yet if and when 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 the shop is after the rumors 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.389
 the beginning of the week is now the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.250
 sticky official confirmation the 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.810
 Microsoft terminations are real 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.720
 but far worse than feared 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.040
 more only six but a total of 18,000 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.090
 wants to make the company in the next 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.920
 year down 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.150
 The main thing is to make that up 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.220
 through the takeover of nokia 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.260
 have become redundant but also the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.600
 Games division is affected all the way 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.030
 the xbox entertainment studio so the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.500
 film and television production company 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.329
 it should be completely sealed 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.430
 but that has no microsoft according to 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.620
 Impact on the production of halo 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.720
 series envious and the accompanying series too 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.400

 We are from this studio closure 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.060
 not further affected that is 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.400
 we are quite normal with the news 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.569

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.099
