 you can easily do in your 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.160
 houses 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:14.230
 the recipe is stuffed tomatoes for this 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.840
 recipe what we are going to need are the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.490
 following ingredients 50 grams of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.029
 tuna a skimmed yogurt 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.070
 a half a tablespoon of capers a couple 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.450
 of small tomatoes or if it is very large 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.879
 only one the juice of a strained lemon 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.570
 two or three stems of chives a pinch 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.739
 of parsley and four anchovy fillets 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 well let's start with the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.910
 making the dish the first thing that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.040
 we have to do is take both 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.760
 tomatoes and cut them for the part 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.760
 higher 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.129
 this way and what we are going to do now 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.129
 is to wake up and get the content 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.230
 of the interior we use only two 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.629
 small tomatoes because this is a 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.879
 ration only for one person if you go 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.590
 to do more you will have to catch and go 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.520
 increasing the proportion of ingredients 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.859
 how many people are you 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.659
 once the tomatoes have been emptied, what 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.210
 we're going to do is with the tomatoes already 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 we are going to leave them face down and what 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's drain one hour and with 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.149
 what we have taken inside we are going to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.280
 go through a colander and we're going to 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.200
 Drain very well while emanating 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 draining the tomatoes what are we going to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.090
 to do is that we will take the four 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.280
 affine anchovy fillets and we'll go 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.590
 putting in a dish with water for 10 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.909
 minutes to leave to examine it 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.909
 and lose the oil 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.230
 once past ten minutes we have 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.330
 caught and we have approached the anchovies 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.980
 water we have drained and we have 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.960
 put on a plate along with others 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.510
 ingredients now what are we going to do 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.190
 is for a milling machine or in this case as 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.040
 I have the thermomix I will use the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.490
 thermomix catch but insert the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.490
 Anchovies 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.860
 the rectum 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.760
 choose together with chopped chives 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.760
 everything in here very well 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.870
 nonfat yogurt 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080
 there goes 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.930
 and the half a tablespoon of the loads 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 in this way drained thus with the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.830
 rabito cut and the juice of a lemon and 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.269
 we're going to put everything to shred once 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.700
 that we have crushed in everything well by the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.230
 thermomix what we are going to do now is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.870
 that we will take the tomato that we have 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.879
 drained previously and we 're going to throw it 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:03.489
 to do now is to take a little bit of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:09.990
 pepper and a little salt and we're going 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:12.500
 to season well 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.500

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.050

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.390
 once centered everything we're going to 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.520
 to do is to take the mixture and pass it 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:30.800
 inside the tomatoes in order to this 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.690
