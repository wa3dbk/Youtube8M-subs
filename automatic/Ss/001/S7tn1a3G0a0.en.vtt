but you had no such a direction where

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.410 
but you had no such a direction where
they<00:01:08.130> were<00:01:08.189> unless<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.700> teammates<00:01:09.030> calling

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

out<00:01:09.510> where<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> coolest

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
out where it is one of the coolest

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.010 
out where it is one of the coolest
moments<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.220> happened<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> was

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
moments that happened was when I was

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.679 
moments that happened was when I was
kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.590> left<00:01:13.979> alone<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:15.210> everybody<00:01:15.630> else

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
kind of left alone when everybody else

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.570 
kind of left alone when everybody else
going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> got<00:01:16.049> taken<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.770> had<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> good

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
going to got taken out I had a good

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640 
going to got taken out I had a good
sense<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> put<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> shield<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.259> very

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
sense to put a shield down in this very

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.200 
sense to put a shield down in this very
strategic<00:01:20.159> area<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> corner<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> room

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
strategic area in the corner of the room

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929 
strategic area in the corner of the room
and<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.110> basically<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.250> came<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.549> but

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and so basically all of them came in but

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.370 
and so basically all of them came in but
I<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:24.150> an<00:01:24.270> advantage<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.869> her<00:01:24.960> knowing<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I had an advantage on her knowing that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
I had an advantage on her knowing that
you<00:01:25.590> only<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.100> life<00:01:26.310> means<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you only have one life means that you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600 
you only have one life means that you
