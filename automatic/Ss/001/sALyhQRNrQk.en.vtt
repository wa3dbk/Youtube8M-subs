Hey! It's Bobby Judo, back from America.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.974
Today, I'm bringing you another cooking video.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:16.858
Recently, I did a week long introduction of American Style 
 cooking on a show called Sawada-de~su for KBC.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:24.725
And of those recipes, my Chicken Wing recipe was pretty well-received, 
 so I wanted to present it here on YouTube too.

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:31.393
BUT! The flavor of those chicken wings…

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:38.340
On the show I made a very mild sweet-hot, even 
 little kids could eat it kind of flavor.

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:47.996
But, as kind of a prank on the host of the show, Sawada 
 Kouji, I also made a SUPER HOT authentic American style hot sauce.

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:55.251
And honestly, I like the Super Hot sauce better.

00:00:55.751 --> 00:01:00.060
So today, we're gonna make "Bobby's Geki-Kara Hot Wings."

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:05.199
Let's go directly to the ingredients!

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:10.671
First, prep the chicken. Today we're using wings and drums.

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:15.542
Coat in some cooking sake, and season with salt and black pepper.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:20.213
Rub some potato-starch into the skin and fry.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.719
You want the skin to get crisp, so I recommend cooking over high heat.

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:30.657
While frying, let's prepare the sauce in a separate pan.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:40.220
I use chili paste as a base for the sauce, and today I'm using 
 Toubanjan. You can use red chili pepper paste… or any kind really.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:48.460
To that, we'll add crushed garlic, chili oil, habanero powder and cayenne pepper.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.630
First pour 1 tbsp chili oil into the frying pan and heat. 

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.240
Then add the powdered spices and watch.

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.920
See the bubbles?

00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:07.760
That's the habanero and cayenne pepper releasing capsaicin.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.030
That's key for making it EXTRA spicy.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:14.130
Add the garlic and toubanjan and stir fry til fragrant.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.180
Then add 3tbsp Tabasco and 3 Tbsp vinegar.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:26.730
When it starts to look like sauce, you want 
 to finish with 20 grams of butter.

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:32.560
Check the chicken wings. Are they cooked all the way through? 

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:37.960
If so, sauce the shit out of them.

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:40.420
This looks hot as balls.

00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:49.420
And with that, it's done! Doesn't this look SUPER SPICY?

00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:52.660
But, it's definitely gonna be delicious.

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:04.280
The chili oil has achieved some seriously deep penetration up in here. Delicious.

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:15.950
But the spiciness catches up with you… it's a slow 
 burn. You can feel it spreading through your mouth.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.060
I REALLY want you guys to try this out. Please 
 cook it at home and check it out.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:30.860
Just eating this is fun enough, but what I'm really looking forward to is…

00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:37.140
Taking the leftover sauce to work tonight and 
 making a bunch of people try it.

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:40.940
I'll try to film it, so if you're curious about 
 everyone's reactions, check back for the next video!

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:44.220
See you later!

00:03:45.722 --> 00:03:53.760
Yeah, this is really pretty spicy. 
My nose is running…. and 
 my face has gotten red, right?
But this is too good...
