00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
car so but on the other hand you can't

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.490 
car so but on the other hand you can't
overestimate<00:03:51.490> its<00:03:52.270> irelia<00:03:52.750> monte<00:03:52.990> carlo<00:03:53.350> and

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
overestimate its irelia monte carlo and

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.990 
overestimate its irelia monte carlo and
you<00:03:53.590> are<00:03:53.680> different<00:03:54.010> strategies<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.850> tire

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
you are different strategies and tire

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.470 
you are different strategies and tire
strategies<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.080> on<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.610> i<00:03:57.610> think<00:03:58.210> it's

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
strategies and so on so i think it's

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.870 
strategies and so on so i think it's
great<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.990> see<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.530> car<00:03:59.710> for<00:04:00.580> sure<00:04:00.610> has

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
great to see that the car for sure has

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.430 
great to see that the car for sure has
the<00:04:01.000> basis<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.570> performance<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.350> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
the basis of the performance and the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.590 
the basis of the performance and the
whole<00:04:02.590> team<00:04:02.770> has<00:04:02.950> done<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.160> fantastic<00:04:03.400> job<00:04:03.850> and

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
whole team has done a fantastic job and

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.330 
whole team has done a fantastic job and
also<00:04:04.930> now<00:04:05.260> when<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.560> look<00:04:05.710> out<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.980> service

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
also now when you look out the service

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.300 
also now when you look out the service
is<00:04:06.490> done<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.060> focused<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:08.310> everybody's

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
is done is so focused so everybody's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.540 
is done is so focused so everybody's
very<00:04:09.460> concentrated<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:11.500> best<00:04:11.770> the<00:04:12.400> best

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
very concentrated and the best the best

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.250 
very concentrated and the best the best
thing<00:04:12.820> from<00:04:12.940> today's<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.540> nobody<00:04:13.930> has<00:04:14.110> done

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
thing from today's that nobody has done

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.320 
thing from today's that nobody has done
any<00:04:14.470> mistake<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:15.130> drivers<00:04:15.550> not<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.880> team<00:04:16.120> not

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
any mistake the drivers not the team not

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.450 
any mistake the drivers not the team not
the<00:04:16.570> team<00:04:17.049> management<00:04:17.410> not<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.980> engineers

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
the team management not the engineers

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.610 
the team management not the engineers
not<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:19.150> think<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.900> best<00:04:20.200> result

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
not so I think that is the best result

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.680 
not so I think that is the best result
of<00:04:20.770> today<00:04:21.040> but<00:04:21.280> no<00:04:21.970> le<00:04:22.120> monde<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.390> color<00:04:22.570> is

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
of today but no le monde the color is

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.600 
of today but no le monde the color is
very<00:04:22.810> long<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.350> today<00:04:23.560> was<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.800> easiest<00:04:24.310> day

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
very long and today was the easiest day

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.760 
very long and today was the easiest day
so<00:04:24.880> it<00:04:25.030> would<00:04:25.210> get<00:04:25.510> even<00:04:25.900> more<00:04:26.050> difficult<00:04:26.290> and

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
so it would get even more difficult and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.210 
so it would get even more difficult and
and<00:04:26.950> our<00:04:27.520> target<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.620> see<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.770> finish<00:04:30.100> in

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and our target is to see the finish in

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.640 
and our target is to see the finish in
Monte<00:04:30.490> Carlo<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:31.000> we<00:04:31.540> are<00:04:31.690> still<00:04:31.990> far<00:04:32.230> off<00:04:32.290> to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
Monte Carlo and we are still far off to

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.620 
Monte Carlo and we are still far off to
achieve<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.430> we'll<00:04:33.880> see<00:04:34.090> what<00:04:34.240> happened

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
achieve that so we'll see what happened

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
achieve that so we'll see what happened
so<00:04:35.020> will<00:04:35.170> be<00:04:35.320> exciting<00:04:35.860> three<00:04:36.340> days
