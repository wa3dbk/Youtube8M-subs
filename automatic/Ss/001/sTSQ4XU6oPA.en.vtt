inside and yeah this is a really nice
shoe<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.640> recommend<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.780> buying<00:02:36.930> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
shoe I recommend going out and buying it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
shoe I recommend going out and buying it
kind<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.190> high<00:02:38.310> price<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.090> think<00:02:39.360> it's

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
kind of a high price but I think it's

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.020 
kind of a high price but I think it's
worth<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.140> how<00:02:40.290> good<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.650> shoe<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.040> so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
worth it for how good of a shoe it is so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
worth it for how good of a shoe it is so
yep<00:02:42.570> that's<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.650> review<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.250> give<00:02:45.150> that
