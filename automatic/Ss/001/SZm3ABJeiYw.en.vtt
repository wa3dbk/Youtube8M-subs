 I must add 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.780
 all the cream 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.870
 summer 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.870
 and the cheese 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.140
 and mix everything well 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.400

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.780
 I'm going to use a mold of bread cake and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.060
 put some baking paper in the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.470
 base if you did not have jce him 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 you can count a little oil a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.310
 little bit of butter in the background and so on 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.280
 We will keep sticking it to us 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.930
 first thing we put are the fillets of 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.680
 chicken 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.680
 the layer 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.040
 figure well 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.220
 all the background and we put a little bit of 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.220
 Salt 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 pepper 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.530
 then 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 of cooked ham 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 let's run well 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.360
 and on top of the cheese they also tried the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.990
 meadow before with the cream and the egg I will 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.960
 put a little 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.160
 not all of this is going to make all the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.160
 plates are pointing us 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 I put about 4 tablespoons 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.770
 and I will continue putting on tapas 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.940

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.940
 until I finish with everything 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.800
 It is important that the last layer be of 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.510
 chicken then we add a little 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 more of the mix we have prepared 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.230
 of egg can 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.410
 then what I'm going to do is cover it with 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.300
 kitchen paper 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.700
 paper that can be put in the oven 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.700

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.400

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.439
 very well obviously baked at 180 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.439
 degrees about 50 minutes 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.670
 once the time has elapsed what 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.920
 we're going to do is take it out and leave it 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.019
 cool a bit if then put it 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.019
 to a minimum of 12 hours in the fridge 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.090
 we already have our cold master's ready 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.640
 chicken stuffed with cooked ham and cheese 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.959
 as you can see it is perfectly noticeable 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.180
 the different layers that we have put 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.849
 all you have to do is 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.310
 slice them into 2-centimeter slices of 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.140
 approximately thickness and accompany it with 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.359
