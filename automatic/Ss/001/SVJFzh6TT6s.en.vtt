video about being a short writer I to
I'm<00:00:12.820> a<00:00:12.910> short<00:00:13.150> ride<00:00:13.269> I've<00:00:13.450> definitely<00:00:13.690> not<00:00:14.170> a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
I'm a short ride I've definitely not a

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.460 
I'm a short ride I've definitely not a
shorter<00:00:14.680> she<00:00:14.890> is<00:00:15.040> I<00:00:15.599> mean<00:00:16.599> she's<00:00:16.869> pretty<00:00:17.140> short

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
shorter she is I mean she's pretty short

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.010 
shorter she is I mean she's pretty short
I<00:00:17.560> guess

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I guess

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560 
I guess
but

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.350 

I<00:00:22.660> had<00:00:23.590> a<00:00:23.619> difficult<00:00:24.130> time<00:00:24.160> finding<00:00:24.789> bikes<00:00:25.060> for

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
I had a difficult time finding bikes for

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.050 
I had a difficult time finding bikes for
me<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.600> ride<00:00:25.950> but<00:00:26.950> at<00:00:27.070> some<00:00:27.310> point<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.849> have<00:00:27.910> to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
me to ride but at some point you have to

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.280 
me to ride but at some point you have to
just<00:00:28.300> say<00:00:28.480> screw<00:00:28.539> it<00:00:29.020> and<00:00:29.939> anyway<00:00:30.939> once<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:32.080> go

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
just say screw it and anyway once you go

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.170 
just say screw it and anyway once you go
past<00:00:32.619> like<00:00:32.980> that<00:00:33.129> miles<00:00:33.400> an<00:00:33.580> hour<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.970> bikes

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
past like that miles an hour the bikes

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.270 
past like that miles an hour the bikes
going<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.450> stand<00:00:34.690> by<00:00:34.750> itself<00:00:35.170> it's<00:00:36.040> just

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
going to stand by itself it's just

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to stand by itself it's just
really<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.780> you're<00:00:37.900> going<00:00:38.079> really<00:00:38.260> slow

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
really the when you're going really slow

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.590 
really the when you're going really slow
like<00:00:40.059> parking

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
like parking

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.139 
like parking
you<00:00:42.079> know<00:00:42.170> reversing<00:00:42.859> the<00:00:42.920> light<00:00:43.129> up<00:00:43.609> this

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
you know reversing the light up this

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.569 
you know reversing the light up this
kind<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.510> hits<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.840> media<00:00:45.050> but<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.070> possible

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
kind of hits the media but it's possible

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.000 
kind of hits the media but it's possible
I<00:00:46.730> mean<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:46.969> know<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.449> lot<00:00:47.629> of<00:00:47.690> other<00:00:47.960> short<00:00:48.350> bike

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
I mean I know a lot of other short bike

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.240 
I mean I know a lot of other short bike
riders

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.170 

so<00:00:52.850> I'm<00:00:52.940> writing<00:00:53.270> an<00:00:53.360> sv650<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.680> I<00:00:55.160> have<00:00:55.520> also

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
so I'm writing an sv650 and I have also

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.990 
so I'm writing an sv650 and I have also
bought<00:00:56.420> some<00:00:56.780> lowering<00:00:57.260> links<00:00:58.600> for<00:00:59.600> my<00:00:59.780> bike

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
bought some lowering links for my bike

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.060 
bought some lowering links for my bike
with<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.120> hopes<00:01:02.330> of<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:03.140> know<00:01:03.350> lowering<00:01:03.890> it

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
with the hopes of you know lowering it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.190 
with the hopes of you know lowering it
but<00:01:04.670> from<00:01:04.820> what<00:01:04.940> i<00:01:05.000> read<00:01:05.300> online<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:06.020> does

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
but from what i read online it does

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.330 
but from what i read online it does
affect<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.510> turning<00:01:08.510> performance<00:01:09.340> because

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
affect the turning performance because

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.250 
affect the turning performance because
it<00:01:10.490> gets<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.850> center<00:01:11.150> of<00:01:11.180> gravity<00:01:11.780> is<00:01:11.900> kind<00:01:12.140> of

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
it gets the center of gravity is kind of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.410 
it gets the center of gravity is kind of
designed<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.830> be<00:01:12.979> where<00:01:13.190> it's<00:01:13.340> at<00:01:13.550> and<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:14.270> you

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
designed to be where it's at and if you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.830 
designed to be where it's at and if you
lower<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:15.160> you're<00:01:16.160> changing<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:17.450> mean

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
lower it you're changing that so I mean

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.230 
lower it you're changing that so I mean
I'm<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:18.920> planning<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.250> race<00:01:19.580> or<00:01:19.850> anything<00:01:20.150> I

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
I'm not planning to race or anything I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.120 
I'm not planning to race or anything I
get<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.510> feel<00:01:20.690> crazy<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.260> emma<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.830> big

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
get to feel crazy that emma is a big

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.370 
get to feel crazy that emma is a big
deal<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> still<00:01:23.869> didn't<00:01:24.170> want<00:01:24.229> to

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
deal but but I still didn't want to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.800 
deal but but I still didn't want to
change<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.620 

physics<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.799> bike<00:01:30.009> so<00:01:30.939> I<00:01:31.000> kind<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.270> left<00:01:31.450> it

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
physics of the bike so I kind of left it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.780 
physics of the bike so I kind of left it
the<00:01:31.750> same<00:01:31.990> what<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.380> did<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:32.979> what<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.369> did<00:01:33.579> was

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
the same what I did to what I did was

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.569 
the same what I did to what I did was
the<00:01:33.880> same<00:01:34.090> as<00:01:34.329> what<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.350> did<00:01:35.649> which<00:01:36.189> was<00:01:36.220> shave

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
the same as what you did which was shave

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.100 
the same as what you did which was shave
the<00:01:36.729> seats<00:01:37.000> out<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.479> that<00:01:37.600> made<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> huge

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the seats out and that made a huge

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.029 
the seats out and that made a huge
difference<00:01:38.490> shaving<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.610> seat<00:01:39.820> down<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
difference shaving the seat down for the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.560 
difference shaving the seat down for the
seat<00:01:42.250> was<00:01:42.399> kind<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.670> really<00:01:42.789> cushioning<00:01:43.329> i

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
seat was kind of really cushioning i

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.020 
seat was kind of really cushioning i
shaped<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.619> down<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.100> probably<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.520> good<00:01:45.759> two

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
shaped it down and probably a good two

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.990 
shaped it down and probably a good two
inches<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.920> maybe<00:01:48.130> an<00:01:48.250> inch<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> half<00:01:48.670> or

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
inches but maybe an inch and a half or

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.219 
inches but maybe an inch and a half or
something<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.229> also<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.479> shaved<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.020> down

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
something and also when I shaved it down

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.220 
something and also when I shaved it down
I<00:01:53.710> also<00:01:53.950> made<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.789> little<00:01:55.000> narrower

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
I also made it a little narrower

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.050 
I also made it a little narrower
that<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:57.860> don't<00:01:58.100> need<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.280> be<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:58.820> elated

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
that I don't need to be so so elated

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.430 
that I don't need to be so so elated
sitting<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.260> know<00:02:00.290> if<00:02:00.440> I'm<00:02:00.590> trying<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.860> drown

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.290 

and<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.980> that<00:02:06.340> really<00:02:06.520> helped<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.880> lot<00:02:06.910> I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
and that that really helped a lot I

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.620 
and that that really helped a lot I

typical put both feet down and that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.680 
typical put both feet down and that
that's<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.820> fine

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
that's that's fine

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.020 
that's that's fine
when<00:02:30.530> i'm<00:02:30.650> back<00:02:30.800> into<00:02:31.130> flights<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.580> what<00:02:32.000> i

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
when i'm back into flights up what i

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.970 
when i'm back into flights up what i
usually<00:02:32.270> try<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.600> do<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.170> push<00:02:33.440> off<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.830> one

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
usually try to do is I push off on one

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.059 
usually try to do is I push off on one
side<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.460> it

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
side in it

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.149 
side in it
I<00:02:36.159> kind<00:02:36.579> of<00:02:36.700> like<00:02:36.840> lots<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:38.049> bike<00:02:38.650> back<00:02:38.920> and

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
I kind of like lots of bike back and

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.970 
I kind of like lots of bike back and
forth<00:02:39.430> saw

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
forth saw

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.949 
forth saw
so<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.849> some<00:02:41.909> traction<00:02:42.300> on<00:02:42.569> my<00:02:42.690> foot

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
so I can get some traction on my foot

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.500 
so I can get some traction on my foot
and<00:02:43.110> push<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.800> bike<00:02:43.950> bathroom<00:02:44.430> either<00:02:45.239> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and push the bike bathroom either that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.850 
and push the bike bathroom either that
where<00:02:45.629> I'll<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:45.930> walk<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.890> flight<00:02:47.099> back

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.990 

but<00:02:53.460> anyway<00:02:53.760> yeah

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.790 

I<00:02:56.240> know<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.720> lot<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.960> people<00:02:57.050> do<00:02:57.380> with<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
I know a lot of people do with the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.160 
I know a lot of people do with the
lowering<00:02:58.040> their

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.530 

I<00:03:03.530> kind<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.010> like<00:03:04.069> being<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.490> higher<00:03:04.700> profit<00:03:05.090> to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
I kind of like being a higher profit to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.809 
I kind of like being a higher profit to
just<00:03:05.930> four<00:03:06.230> beautiful<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:09.400> probably<00:03:10.400> notice

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
just four beautiful you probably notice

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.460 
just four beautiful you probably notice
the<00:03:11.090> difference<00:03:11.420> between<00:03:11.599> your<00:03:11.959> garage<00:03:12.290> oh

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the difference between your garage oh

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.830 
the difference between your garage oh
and<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.880> enjoy<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.480> nature<00:03:14.599> you

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
and that you enjoy the nature you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.430 
and that you enjoy the nature you
publicly<00:03:15.200> up<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.590> little<00:03:15.830> higher

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.780 

those<00:03:20.010> makes<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.430> kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.790> differential

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
those makes it kind of a differential

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.420 
those makes it kind of a differential
party

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.220 

and<00:03:27.670> then<00:03:27.909> also<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.239> guess<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.750> right<00:03:28.900> position

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
and then also I guess the right position

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.640 
and then also I guess the right position
one<00:03:30.620> button

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.030 

instead<00:03:34.159> of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.570 

laid<00:03:37.370> back

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
laid back

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.000 
laid back
oh<00:03:40.470> yeah<00:03:41.470> if<00:03:41.650> anybody<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:43.150> know<00:03:43.240> kind<00:03:43.480> of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
oh yeah if anybody is you know kind of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.410 
oh yeah if anybody is you know kind of
worried<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.310> they're<00:03:45.610> too<00:03:45.790> short<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:46.270> mean

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
worried that they're too short I mean

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.720 
worried that they're too short I mean
I'm<00:03:46.540> 54<00:03:48.090> I've<00:03:49.090> definitely<00:03:49.390> not<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> big<00:03:50.200> guy

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
I'm 54 I've definitely not a big guy

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.640 
I'm 54 I've definitely not a big guy
I<00:03:51.849> don't<00:03:52.450> wait<00:03:52.659> too<00:03:52.870> much<00:03:52.900> either<00:03:53.230> I'm<00:03:53.470> like

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
I don't wait too much either I'm like

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.880 
I don't wait too much either I'm like
one

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.880 

I<00:03:58.010> write<00:03:58.670> an<00:03:58.850> sv650<00:03:59.690> fine<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.470> could<00:04:00.680> probably

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
I write an sv650 fine I could probably

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.880 
I write an sv650 fine I could probably
write<00:04:01.340> a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
write a

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.320 
write a
success<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.640> believe<00:04:03.970> would<00:04:04.150> have<00:04:04.300> a

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
success that I believe would have a

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.700 
success that I believe would have a
harder<00:04:04.660> time<00:04:06.240> 1000

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
harder time 1000

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.630 
harder time 1000
or<00:04:09.010> sport<00:04:09.340> bike<00:04:09.520> headed<00:04:09.870> right

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.430 

I<00:04:13.760> don't<00:04:14.330> have<00:04:14.450> any<00:04:14.630> problem<00:04:14.660> something<00:04:15.380> on

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
I don't have any problem something on

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.840 
I don't have any problem something on
also<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:18.180> SB<00:04:18.680> 6650<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:19.860> very<00:04:20.190> light<00:04:20.519> fight

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
also the SB 6650 is a very light fight

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.600 
also the SB 6650 is a very light fight
and<00:04:21.510> it's<00:04:21.690> very<00:04:21.780> well<00:04:22.140> balanced<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.040> that

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
and it's very well balanced so that that

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.780 
and it's very well balanced so that that
helps<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.180> some<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.400> sport<00:04:26.400> bikes

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
helps to some of the sport bikes

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.310 
helps to some of the sport bikes
the<00:04:28.150> center<00:04:28.420> of<00:04:28.450> gravity<00:04:28.840> might<00:04:28.990> be<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.140> little

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
the center of gravity might be a little

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.800 
the center of gravity might be a little
higher

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.910 

me

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920 

so<00:04:36.160> that's<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.640> might<00:04:36.820> be<00:04:36.970> might<00:04:37.750> play<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
so that's that might be might play a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.090 
so that's that might be might play a
part

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
part

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.430 
part
here<00:04:40.960> but<00:04:41.960> anyway<00:04:42.200> about<00:04:43.190> it
