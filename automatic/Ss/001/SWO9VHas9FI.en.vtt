00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
this hard stuff is all a carbon fiber

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.029 
this hard stuff is all a carbon fiber
the<00:01:22.670> white<00:01:22.850> line<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.960> white<00:01:24.200> line<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.740> like

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
the line where it divides from carbon

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.440 
the line where it divides from carbon
fiber<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:29.140> other<00:01:30.140> material<00:01:31.299> she'll<00:01:32.299> go

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
fiber to a other material she'll go

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.669 
fiber to a other material she'll go
along<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.750> whole<00:01:32.899> show<00:01:34.869> um<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.170> nike<00:01:36.350> swoosh

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
along the whole show um the nike swoosh

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:43.059 
along the whole show um the nike swoosh
is<00:01:36.950> black<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.580> it's<00:01:37.850> got<00:01:38.030> some<00:01:38.679> green<00:01:42.069> love

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.480 
thing all right then the lace things one
of<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.600> phone<00:02:02.780> lace<00:02:03.530> loops<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.979> guess<00:02:04.159> they're

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
of the phone lace loops I guess they're

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.639 
of the phone lace loops I guess they're
green<00:02:05.240> but<00:02:05.929> then<00:02:06.049> when<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.319> down<00:02:06.470> here

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
green but then when you go down here

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.680 
green but then when you go down here
they're<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:06.979> black<00:02:10.120> alright<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:12.260> moving<00:02:13.250> on

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
they're just black alright so moving on

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.319 
they're just black alright so moving on
still<00:02:14.690> carbon<00:02:15.049> fiber<00:02:15.260> again<00:02:15.850> all<00:02:16.850> this<00:02:17.209> is

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
still carbon fiber again all this is

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.979 
still carbon fiber again all this is
carbon<00:02:17.690> fire<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.730> then<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.540> guess<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
carbon fire and then like I guess it

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.479 
carbon fire and then like I guess it
would<00:02:21.109> be<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.320> Mitchells<00:02:21.850> lime<00:02:22.850> green<00:02:24.489> again

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
would be the Mitchells lime green again

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.420 
would be the Mitchells lime green again
lace<00:02:26.150> loops<00:02:26.959> lime<00:02:27.890> green<00:02:29.739> in<00:02:30.739> this<00:02:30.950> little

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
lace loops lime green in this little

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.490 
lace loops lime green in this little
part<00:02:31.609> right<00:02:31.640> here<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.940> carbon<00:02:32.239> fiber<00:02:32.500> it's

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
part right here is carbon fiber it's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.130 
part right here is carbon fiber it's
really<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:33.859> the<00:02:33.980> same<00:02:34.010> around<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.670> shoe<00:02:35.140> then

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
really all the same around the shoe then

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.550 
really all the same around the shoe then
on<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.290> back<00:02:37.390> yet<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> penny<00:02:38.750> man<00:02:39.319> right

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
on the back yet the penny man right

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.789 
on the back yet the penny man right
there<00:02:39.819> one<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.000> basketball<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.319> late<00:02:42.590> are

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
the shoehorn holder I guess is what it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.879 
the shoehorn holder I guess is what it
called<00:02:46.549> is<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> black<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.019> middle<00:02:48.560> that's

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
called is a black with the middle that's

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:54.520 
called is a black with the middle that's

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
lime green and i forgot to say i'm going

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.890 
lime green and i forgot to say i'm going
to<00:02:54.590> outline<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:54.950> part<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.280> my<00:02:55.370> finger<00:02:55.900> all

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
to outline that part of my finger all

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.069 
to outline that part of my finger all
that<00:02:57.560> all<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.180> our<00:02:59.450> new<00:02:59.660> book<00:02:59.870> I<00:03:02.079> believe
