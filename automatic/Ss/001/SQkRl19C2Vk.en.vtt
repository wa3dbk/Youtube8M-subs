00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
to increase one stitch on each needle so

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.149 
to increase one stitch on each needle so
instead<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> having<00:01:12.390> two<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.220> will<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.400> three

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
instead of having two I will have three

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.469 
instead of having two I will have three

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the back of the first stitch on every

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.670 
the back of the first stitch on every
needle<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:28.789> this<00:01:29.789> round

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.560 

this<00:01:39.770> gets<00:01:40.009> easier<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.670> get<00:01:41.360> more

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
this gets easier as you get more

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.889 
this gets easier as you get more

stitches on your needles you're now
going<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.260> knit<00:03:44.590> straight<00:03:45.159> you're<00:03:45.669> not

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
going to just knit straight you're not

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.449 
going to just knit straight you're not
going<00:03:46.419> to<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:46.659> any<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.109> increases<00:03:47.919> for<00:03:48.430> a

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
going to do any more increases for a

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:55.140 
going to do any more increases for a
while<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:50.079> just<00:03:50.189> knit<00:03:51.629> don't<00:03:52.629> increase<00:03:54.120> or<00:03:55.120> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
while so just knit don't increase or a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.990 
while so just knit don't increase or a
few<00:03:55.569> rows<00:03:55.810> we're<00:03:56.169> going<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.590> make<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:57.040> oval

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
few rows we're going to make this oval

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.080 
few rows we're going to make this oval
shape<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.709> order<00:03:59.949> to<00:04:00.099> do<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.729> start

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
shape so in order to do that you start

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.129 
shape so in order to do that you start
with<00:04:01.329> a<00:04:01.510> few<00:04:01.780> stitches<00:04:02.639> you<00:04:03.639> get<00:04:03.909> to<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.810> mini

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
with a few stitches you get to this mini

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.530 
with a few stitches you get to this mini
and<00:04:05.470> then<00:04:06.430> you're<00:04:06.639> going<00:04:06.849> to<00:04:07.000> knit<00:04:07.150> straight

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
and then you're going to knit straight

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.569 
and then you're going to knit straight
and<00:04:07.750> then<00:04:07.840> we're<00:04:08.019> going<00:04:08.169> to<00:04:08.290> be<00:04:08.579> decreasing

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
and then we're going to be decreasing

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:19.069 
and then we're going to be decreasing
but<00:04:09.879> not<00:04:10.090> for<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.329> little<00:04:10.510> bit

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079
