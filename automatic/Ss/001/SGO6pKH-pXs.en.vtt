st.<00:01:17.820> Louis<00:01:18.090> Rams<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
st. Louis Rams and I don't think the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.600 
st. Louis Rams and I don't think the
Rams<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.619> bad<00:01:19.830> they're<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.400> far

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
Rams are that bad they're not that far

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
Rams are that bad they're not that far
off<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.360> only<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> few<00:01:22.049> needs<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> my

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
off so they only have a few needs in my

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
off so they only have a few needs in my
opinion<00:01:22.950> quarterback<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.939> they<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
opinion quarterback is one they have to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
opinion quarterback is one they have to
find<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.930> franchise<00:01:25.380> guy<00:01:25.650> offensive<00:01:26.369> line<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
find a franchise guy offensive line is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.429 
find a franchise guy offensive line is
another<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.869> they<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.110> utilize

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
another and I think they can utilize

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.370 
another and I think they can utilize
some<00:01:28.680> depth<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.100> cornerback

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
I'm a big fan of cam Irving's game out

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.889 
I'm a big fan of cam Irving's game out
of<00:01:38.170> Florida<00:01:38.590> State<00:01:38.799> at<00:01:38.979> 65<00:01:39.460> 313<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.420> offensive

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
of Florida State at 65 313 the offensive

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.810 
of Florida State at 65 313 the offensive
lineman<00:01:41.200> can<00:01:41.320> play<00:01:41.530> any<00:01:41.829> one<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.579> five

positions up front and I think he can

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.310 
positions up front and I think he can
have<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.220> home<00:01:45.549> at<00:01:45.789> center<00:01:46.210> for<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.780> st.<00:01:47.079> Louis

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
my honest opinion there's not much of a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.230 
my honest opinion there's not much of a
difference<00:02:02.710> between<00:02:02.799> Huntley<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.610> Mariota

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
difference between Huntley and Mariota

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.850 
difference between Huntley and Mariota
and<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.539> think<00:02:04.780> Huntley<00:02:05.049> actually<00:02:05.470> brings<00:02:05.710> you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
and I think Huntley actually brings you

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.400 
and I think Huntley actually brings you
more<00:02:06.069> from<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.789> pure<00:02:07.210> pocket<00:02:07.689> standpoint<00:02:08.259> as

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
more from the pure pocket standpoint as

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.870 
more from the pure pocket standpoint as
opposed<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.830> what<00:02:08.860> Mariota<00:02:09.340> does<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.789> think

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
opposed to what Mariota does so I think

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.150 
opposed to what Mariota does so I think
he'd<00:02:10.420> be<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.569> perfect<00:02:10.810> fit<00:02:11.049> in<00:02:11.290> st.<00:02:11.590> Louis<00:02:11.860> along

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
he'd be a perfect fit in st. Louis along

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.440 
he'd be a perfect fit in st. Louis along
with<00:02:12.190> Jeff<00:02:12.549> Fisher<00:02:16.799> in<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:18.730> third<00:02:19.060> round<00:02:19.299> I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
with Jeff Fisher in the third round I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.210 
with Jeff Fisher in the third round I
went<00:02:19.630> cornerback<00:02:20.110> with<00:02:20.290> PJ<00:02:20.620> Williams<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.099> of
