00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 and we are from the third with a friend 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.750
 of the house norm of the river how are you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.019
 it goes well very well 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.120
 tancreate always welcome me always 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.730
 grateful then for in life of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.560
 I'm really glad you brought today 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.960
 watercolor let's make a putt this is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.960
 the patio of the pulpería d 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 is the back the bleached the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.059
 bleached is called the aim and this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.840
 is the rooster apart from the read I read 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.540
 about that place 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.990
 I already brought the work here a little 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.720
 advanced because the idea is to show 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.840
 Various techniques 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.390
 let's start with this column here 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.910
 that is going to imitate a little bit to the wall 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.110
 that I already have here is all watered down this is 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.670
 a technique is a finger on wet 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.269
 moisten 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.280
 the column passed over the leaves 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.670
 sale of some leaves drawn in a 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 rosebush 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.649
 that has liquid masked because 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.630
 I'm interested that those leaves after 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:23.470
 give them a touch of light if I do not put 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.890
 the masked when painting from above capó 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.250
 everything will never achieve the necessary light 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.909
 you need the brightness leaves 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.399
 the leaves when the sun hits 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.100
 much much brightness and that I have to 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.110
 achieve it by helping me with the target of 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.539
 the sheet in the column you're working 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.899
 director and I work the paper on the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:49.780
 paper that is wet then threw 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.210
 some touches 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.540
 if there is any color that I do not like as 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.299
 for example, this is the withdrawal 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.210
 I can remove everything in a bit of 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.880
 paper because I put too much good water 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.520
 this we leave it there to work that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.600
 dry solito goes to work we go to 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:14.590
 another little corner here some some 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.959
 trunks to make the trunks I 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.090
 can I have to think about where the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.890
 light and from this side I want it clear 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.930
 on the other hand I want dark and then 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.100
 the side that I'm going to put clearly that uses 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.100
 a name in this case 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.739
 I reserve without water this dry side this 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.010
 perfect on the left side I insist 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.129
 this side if I have to think about it and the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.240
 another side I put a kid of water that 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.980
 without reaching the other limit 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.980
 then all you think 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.130
 this is taught in your courses this 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.360
 I teach in my courses and come with the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.240
 ocher where it was dry and I let that from to 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.950
 little that the rest I run the rest run 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.290
 they want to see it better we're going to put a 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.320
 tone a little bit darker but not 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.030
 correspond before while you go 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.890
 working we remind you of the lady 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.560
 norm is a teacher and in watercolor in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.730
 oil in a creel and in accelerating pillar of 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.670
 that chalk cake or the ladies that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.040
 they want to stop tracing because they 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.400
 they feel tied want to make their new 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.180
 creations I teach them to draw their 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.000
 own to import their own projects 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.390
 normal we have to go and we stayed 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.700
 give that I will not see if for some 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.700
 side we are getting up 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.820

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.000
 space for china caac here then 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.220
 six goals and I started working and here 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.600
 he also made a back wall look 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.080

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.470

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:18.150
 bright here also took out and I appear 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.970
 the space to make the leaves 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.520
 bright with the colors that to me 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.770
 interested in yellow athletes 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.630
 which is reflecting ties to 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.600
 listen to a standard there are a lot of 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.100
 things that normal can teach you and 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.910
 attention teaches you to draw that that is 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.510
