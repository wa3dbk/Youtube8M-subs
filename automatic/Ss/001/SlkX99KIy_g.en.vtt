00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hello, I want everyone in addition 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.820
 removing the rabbit about that here this roller 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.490
 where to dry meat fish and so on 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.929
 I want to make this video for you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.699
 do it right steamed if you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 do court then there is no problem with that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.529
 just throw liquid well water and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 cook yourself a soup there or what is good so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.960
 the same thing but if you need it like in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.449
 In my case, the meat now needs this elk 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.610
 moose meat means i need to take it on 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 pizza on the cake rather I will do with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.790
 meat means I need liquid not 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.579
 was what we do means we take 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 cup that's spread ground I can not say 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.149
 Exactly useful as it cups 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.969
 Now I will tell you the very basis 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 oriented on the heated kettle 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.120
 boiling water and pour so slightly 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.680
 literally covered it like this all the more 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.080
 you can not fill because it will remain 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 yushka you see, yes I will leave and that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 now the main thing is to make we take on 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.520
 lid on this cup no i will take 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.520
 I will cover the usual small plate and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.640
 turn on the tile one turn on 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.140
 tile one for what our purpose 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 so that you can not keep on twos for 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 in order to maintain this temperature 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.549
 for the park once meat means now take 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.159
 spoon will show you in what condition it is 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:49.700
 so a little light don't like it already 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.350
 began to swell and rise above the water 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.770
 our task is to stir from time to time 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.409
 meat so that now that got out 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.630
 water on the surface it does not get wet and 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.689
 our task is him from time to time 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.890
 smaller so that it comes into contact with water 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.870
 the result should be only meat 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.720
 a couple of drops of water is it 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.490
 it is not important here means 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.650
 warm now supporting water 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.470
 the temperature on me is important to boil 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.130
 we are the main thing that the temperature was about 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.250
 boiling here and close plate time 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.440
 from time to time stirring it that way 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.860
 we steam the meat also myself 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.420
 considered in vegetables for omelet here 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.490
 mean onion 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.820
 that I once watered lean challenged 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.330
 zucchini tomatoes i mean i mixed the whole 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.490
 this mixture and just as she poured 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 a little water a little bit 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.270
 a little literally there still need less even 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.540
 in vegetables than meat and so do everything century 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.100
 I went a couple here and now everything will be 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.850
 once rubbed the end will show that from this 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.430
 came out 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.440
 I will immediately say if the year is that is 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 I will not cheat so that everyone 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.740
 did show about reliable information 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.740
 Now I'll show you what it means 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.060
 apples when warmed up well 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.460
 first switched to tile a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.930
 then I turned it off completely 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:17.360
 As a result, we got such meat 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:23.310
 I'll show you a liquid now very tasty. 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.310
 pour that look at the liquid and in 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.920
 late all the same there is a little bit like me 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.070
 talked a little bit still remains the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.070
 have it for 5 maximum for 10 grams of water 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.000
 you can simply add less to the cup's 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.590
 its just a skirt too, literally me 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.440
 slightly left and you can just 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.400
 a little podvarit like to boil 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.610
 This jack cup here we have a result 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.850
 turned out so beautiful ready-made cake 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.280
 pizza and so on to stuffing dumplings 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.280
 pies and similar products
