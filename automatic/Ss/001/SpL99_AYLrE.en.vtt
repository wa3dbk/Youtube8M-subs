changes<00:02:33.439> the<00:02:33.500> volume<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.099> ambience<00:02:34.790> channels

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
changes the volume of ambience channels

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.319 
changes the volume of ambience channels
so<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.349> affects<00:02:36.469> the<00:02:36.980> entire<00:02:37.250> kit<00:02:37.879> piece<00:02:38.120> and

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
so it affects the entire kit piece and

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.479 
so it affects the entire kit piece and
all<00:02:38.419> its<00:02:38.629> recordings<00:02:39.200> if<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.829> hit<00:02:40.010> my<00:02:40.189> snare

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
all its recordings if I hit my snare

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:49.629 
all its recordings if I hit my snare
drum<00:02:46.419> and<00:02:47.419> pull<00:02:47.719> the<00:02:47.840> trim<00:02:48.049> down<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.980> can<00:02:49.189> hear

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
drum and pull the trim down you can hear

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.479 
drum and pull the trim down you can hear
and<00:02:49.879> see<00:02:49.909> there<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.069> volumes<00:02:52.340> have

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and see there that all the volumes have

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:00.220 
and see there that all the volumes have
been<00:02:52.579> lowered<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:58.549> pan<00:02:58.969> control<00:02:59.480> works<00:02:59.900> for

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
been lowered the pan control works for

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.800 
been lowered the pan control works for
direct<00:03:00.829> channel<00:03:01.280> only<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:02.060> doesn't<00:03:02.389> work<00:03:02.569> for

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
direct channel only it doesn't work for

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.559 
direct channel only it doesn't work for
ambient<00:03:03.230> mics<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:05.060> pan<00:03:05.329> my<00:03:05.569> snare<00:03:06.099> left

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
ambient mics so I can pan my snare left

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:28.679 
ambient mics so I can pan my snare left
or<00:03:08.569> right<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:16.299> have<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> mute<00:03:17.629> and<00:03:17.840> solo<00:03:18.019> button

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:28.689 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.679 

and<00:03:30.549> finally<00:03:31.549> I<00:03:31.579> have<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.939> flip<00:03:32.180> ambience

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689 
and finally I have the flip ambience

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.349 
and finally I have the flip ambience
button<00:03:33.109> what<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.799> does<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.280> flip<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.970> stereo

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359

tightening up a drum sound let's see how
that<00:05:19.560> works<00:05:20.720> if<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:22.020> trigger<00:05:22.260> my<00:05:22.440> snare<00:05:23.960> and

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
that works if I trigger my snare and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.670 
that works if I trigger my snare and
increase<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.620> damping<00:05:26.010> amount<00:05:30.260> you<00:05:31.260> can<00:05:31.410> hear

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
increase the damping amount you can hear

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.710 
increase the damping amount you can hear
I've<00:05:31.919> ended<00:05:32.310> up<00:05:32.430> with<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> much<00:05:32.790> tighter<00:05:33.150> snare

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
I've ended up with a much tighter snare

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.780 
I've ended up with a much tighter snare

that<00:06:27.229> I<00:06:27.410> want<00:06:27.470> a<00:06:27.910> softer<00:06:28.910> snare<00:06:29.240> in<00:06:29.539> this

that I want a softer snare in this
groove<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.349> could<00:06:30.530> just<00:06:30.680> pull<00:06:30.919> the<00:06:31.039> dynamics

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:38.170 
groove I could just pull the dynamics
down<00:06:35.740> and<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:36.889> can<00:06:37.070> hear<00:06:37.370> the<00:06:37.580> snare<00:06:37.849> being

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
down and you can hear the snare being

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.110 
down and you can hear the snare being
hit<00:06:38.419> softer<00:06:39.370> alternatively<00:06:40.370> and<00:06:40.699> I<00:06:40.729> can<00:06:40.910> push

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
hit softer alternatively and I can push

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.050 
hit softer alternatively and I can push
it<00:06:41.270> up<00:06:41.449> to<00:06:43.090> get<00:06:44.090> a<00:06:44.120> much<00:06:44.330> louder<00:06:44.570> snare
