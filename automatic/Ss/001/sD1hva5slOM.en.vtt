00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.400
 six playable heroes high beginner friendly and one 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.279
 huge unknown game world in which a religious war reigns 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.900
 no Fanta she goes with part 13 new ways 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.699
 The epic proportions of APA have remained the same 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 of the new Japanese oll game 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.900
 The beginning of fine Fantasy 13 is tedious and tough 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.660
 It takes a long time for the emotional story unfolds and the combat system 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.820
 declared 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.530
 Mehring x has also thrown some crude old series virtues overboard 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.530
 exploring other cities or many mini-games 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 The great mix from Kempten has remained the same 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.920
 followed by London Dolly Passes which are either in the compass tables 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.839
 and technically impressive rendered videos or in graphics 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.839
 be told 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.540
 No 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.370
 most of the time player spends work in Kempten 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.000
 and this band FF 3 5 expected as elemental damage game 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 the fortune in a few small slipstream continued 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.410
 The combat system will be played piece by piece in the first 12 hours of play 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.219
 explained 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.009
 so that nobody is overwhelmed it feels despite many changes 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.400
 to the fine Fanta she » 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.710
 it is very complex 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.450
 and gives players how much time it takes to put in big ones 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.610
 variations 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 The goal in the fight is usually 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.650
 Opponents fast 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.220
 to put in shock 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.410
 now displayed on the top right in the form of a bar 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.040
 when filled, the opponent gets massive damage 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.440
 as soon as the fastest driver 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.719
 and speed 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.149
 At the end of the fight, a 5-star system scores if I'm really dangerous 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.839
 For five stars, there are numbers of items as a reward 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.110
 unlike in earlier cases she thinks 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 the player controls in part three are doing only one character 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.929
 At any time, he can assign his colleagues another job for the 52nd 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.279
 for example healer or was good for 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.150
 the constant switching back and forth of the job 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.189
 Christ in the end but again comparable 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.090
 with the quick way out a free sick or manual weaknesses 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.190
 heavy opponent 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.839
 from earlier parts of the series 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:52.559
 the later fights and frost fighters generally require a proper 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.559
 Pinch tactics and responsive changing jobs 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.999
 and if all that is not enough, they are the typically pompous ones 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.999
 Summon score 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.049
 In order to fall down to 3 5 players will have to play all the parameters in the game 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.540
 Christa government to improve their characters 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.540
 There they will be equipped with new skills 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.500
 At memory points there is also the possibility of equipment not 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.789
 on last 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.279
 If you say "Game Over" players are allowed to tackle the fight directly again 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.799
 frustrating loading of scores is thus eliminated 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.370
 In the end, the excitement over the action charged to fight outweighs 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.719
 with the optional 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.719
 and the tactical finesse fight 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.439
 makes recommendable 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.449
 not for friends of Ford loud or Krägen Elz 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.910
 but be patient with the will 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.509
 who accept it 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.210
 that is only a few free and Bahr FDP returns 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.069
 and the game is very late 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.369
 Potential outlook
