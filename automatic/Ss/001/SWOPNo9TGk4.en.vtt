00:04:47.830 --> 00:05:02.820 

which<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.610> this<00:04:48.940> is<00:04:49.180> crooked<00:04:49.629> Oh

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.170 

but<00:05:03.830> went<00:05:04.010> ahead<00:05:04.100> and<00:05:04.400> just<00:05:04.490> cut<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:07.180> know

but went ahead and just cut it I know

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.710 
but went ahead and just cut it I know
that<00:05:08.480> I<00:05:08.540> got<00:05:08.690> some<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.260> crooked<00:05:09.680> but<00:05:09.980> I<00:05:10.720> have

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
that I got some of it crooked but I have

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:20.230 
that I got some of it crooked but I have
dark<00:05:11.990> hair<00:05:12.320> so<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:15.020> can't<00:05:15.350> really<00:05:15.830> tell<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:20.120> is

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
dark hair so you can't really tell it is

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.080 
dark hair so you can't really tell it is
a<00:05:20.270> little<00:05:20.600> shorter<00:05:21.080> on<00:05:21.110> one<00:05:21.230> side<00:05:21.680> but<00:05:22.090> the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
a little shorter on one side but the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.910 
a little shorter on one side but the
easy<00:05:23.270> way<00:05:23.540> to<00:05:23.600> fix<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.140> if<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.410> want<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.740> just

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
easy way to fix that if you want to just

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.650 
easy way to fix that if you want to just
part<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:26.500> in<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.680> different<00:05:28.040> angle<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:32.510> you

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
part it in a different angle and you

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.480 
part it in a different angle and you
can't<00:05:32.870> really<00:05:33.050> tell<00:05:33.320> but<00:05:34.450> as<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.780> can<00:05:35.960> see<00:05:36.490> all

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
can't really tell but as you can see all

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.220 
can't really tell but as you can see all
of<00:05:37.550> my<00:05:38.920> layers<00:05:39.920> that<00:05:40.340> are<00:05:40.460> right<00:05:40.640> here<00:05:41.230> it's

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
of my layers that are right here it's

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.930 
of my layers that are right here it's
definitely<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.740> lot<00:05:42.980> shorter<00:05:43.310> on<00:05:43.640> this<00:05:43.850> side

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.659 

but<00:05:50.350> it<00:05:51.350> doesn't<00:05:51.680> look<00:05:51.830> bad<00:05:52.040> for<00:05:52.070> my<00:05:52.460> first

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
but it doesn't look bad for my first

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.680 
but it doesn't look bad for my first
time<00:05:52.880> trying<00:05:53.210> it

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.680 

so<00:05:59.200> there<00:05:59.380> you<00:05:59.410> have<00:05:59.560> it
