00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.200
 saying discover hey he finds what 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.430
 bring what happens I do not know what in the end you do not know 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.020
 that invented because he has gone from 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.790
 100,000 different people that in my 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.830
 different meats and in the end then 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.270
 as the wheat farm say the lowered it 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.430
 I invented the name of wheat 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.690
 we are crazy so when after 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.550
 all this nonsense that I just said 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.540
 let's start let's start but the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.380
 Today's trick is how to basically do 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.180
 swings with a cheese do not see that the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.820
 action to extreme decoration that is 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.320
 ice we already brought the bonfire that if it was 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.610
 tutorial from the source the other day for 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.619
 decorating that was fine with the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.960
 management system that direct these the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.560
 and what a good game and they came to me 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.270
 my subscribers paula photo orbit and and 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.310
 good today I bring you this from 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.440
 müller how to make these swings with 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.630
 strings that is pretty cool ballets 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.180
 everything first had undo what comes 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.360
 being the mold worth the mold is going to be 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.980
 this 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.450
 and we will raise it to the height that we 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.490
 there is no minimum height 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.980
 say up to here this is a 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.770
 peculiarity but good and we are going 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.570
 around here these are berries and for example 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.190
 ago I'm going to see a swing of 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.810
 three according then 3 1 3 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.810
 and acclaimed and downspouts 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:27.310
 and once this is done we are going to get into 2 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.550
 val in a 3 for 2 to a 3 for 3 sorry a 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.320
 4 is a 4 high on the whole green and 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.390
 being the platform is worth less the stick 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.030
 everything and we will go down to 3 in height 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.270
 agree by 10 3 tall now what 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.270
 we will see 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.710
 so we 're going to go down practically 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.300
 also what influences there apart from what 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.920
 what we're going to do now is the system 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.220
 light make the strings are colored 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.010
 black until agreement that's hard 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.510
 well we have already come down here 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.700
 and the next thing we have to do is take a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.100
 bone 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.050
 a bone yes and a wolf 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.410
 the wolf's eye let's see here 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.890
 has already sat down next is sitting 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.890
 following 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.680
 nothing 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.439
 following 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.330
 make it feel good to make them be 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.900
 yours 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.569
 the Celtic 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.799
 and they have sat very well in this nothing 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.959
 because we said that there was not going to be 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.730
 nothing once done that and we have 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.349
 sitting and placed in such a way that 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.209
 they are going to move never never I leave you 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.209
 bases and come here 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.240
 catch with the rope 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.610
 or the same and it does not let me 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.970
 A) Yes 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.460
 go let's see that lower the height 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.980
 It seems that heights every week do not 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.739
 we will be able 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.110
 so let's lower the height these 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.580
 things happen when you record and think 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.030
 option to catch and start again and 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.720
 decide and do not go sweaty or recognize that you 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.909
 you have wrong 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.940
 3 the mold almost of player 5 the faith is 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.370
 everything perfect and continue with two lived in 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.019
 this case I recognize my that is good 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.340
 what we are going to do is when 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.340
 agrees to climb the above 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.830
 there is 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.060
 he is 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.800
 and there it is once this is done let's go 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.210
 filling in so we want the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.500
 bolts morán asique derek 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.500
 the filling tarte well 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:49.619
 very well as realm of land according 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:51.719
 I'm going to this land will become 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.809
 green and what we are going to do now is 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:56.369
 very simple we take a tile which 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.199
 you want and in this case to catch 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:01.619
 of meadow to be a little more 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.679
 realistic and we cover as you see he remembers 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:06.899
 will continue to work, and now it is 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:09.329
 we go and we cover but it has not got 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:11.429
 to become total black ballet there are the 

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:13.439
 ropes I wanted to do is come to the 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:15.329
 next stage to cope and we count these 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.569
 those there is is in the black environment there 

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:21.059
 for all the black and this is already here 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.639
 I swing the truth how old just because 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:25.469
 the ropes are not all that comes 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.849
 being straight they are very moved and of 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.949
 done as the dog can move there 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.839
 down or in position 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.339
 the position of the seated you can move 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.929
 the ropes like they are moving 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.919
 as if it were a swing in agreement 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:39.599
 then create this illusion of swing 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.399
 in good kraft that the truth that remains 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.439
 very good and very cool so to Mr. 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.749
