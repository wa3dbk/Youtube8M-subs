in doing this you will notice quite a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.950 
in doing this you will notice quite a
bit<00:00:54.590> of<00:00:54.710> resistance<00:00:54.830> because<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.180> back<00:00:56.660> case

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
bit of resistance because the back case

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.900 
bit of resistance because the back case
is<00:00:57.260> actually<00:00:57.620> glued<00:00:58.130> in<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.460> middle<00:01:00.160> now<00:01:01.160> pry
