00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.370 

okay<00:00:01.020> now<00:00:01.319> let's<00:00:02.070> go<00:00:02.250> for<00:00:02.520> our<00:00:03.020> freeway<00:00:04.020> test

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
okay now let's go for our freeway test

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
okay now let's go for our freeway test
drive

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.810 

so<00:00:13.030> this<00:00:13.390> this<00:00:14.200> landcruiser<00:00:14.740> has<00:00:15.130> a<00:00:15.160> split

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
so this this landcruiser has a split

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.960 
so this this landcruiser has a split
case<00:00:16.090> as<00:00:16.420> you<00:00:16.600> can<00:00:16.630> seen<00:00:16.990> by<00:00:17.260> the<00:00:17.700> twin<00:00:18.700> sticks

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
case as you can seen by the twin sticks

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:28.769 
case as you can seen by the twin sticks
and<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:26.619> that<00:00:26.740> it<00:00:27.009> has<00:00:27.189> front<00:00:27.779> manual

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
and because of that it has front manual

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.650 
and because of that it has front manual
locking<00:00:29.200> hubs<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.919> they<00:00:30.820> are<00:00:30.939> in<00:00:31.119> freewheel

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
locking hubs and they are in freewheel

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.900 
locking hubs and they are in freewheel
right<00:00:31.960> now<00:00:32.200> so<00:00:32.560> I<00:00:32.590> would<00:00:32.770> anticipate<00:00:33.100> that<00:00:33.640> the

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
right now so I would anticipate that the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.750 
right now so I would anticipate that the
ABS<00:00:34.240> light<00:00:34.630> is<00:00:34.930> going<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:36.100> turn<00:00:36.310> on<00:00:36.340> and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
ABS light is going to turn on and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.330 
ABS light is going to turn on and
they're<00:00:36.940> just<00:00:37.720> turned<00:00:38.500> on<00:00:38.710> when<00:00:38.920> we<00:00:38.980> started

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
they're just turned on when we started

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.190 
they're just turned on when we started
rolling

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.170 

not<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:42.920> be<00:00:43.040> concerned<00:00:43.489> because<00:00:43.790> that's

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
not to be concerned because that's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.200 
not to be concerned because that's
because<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.630> the<00:00:48.370> manual<00:00:49.370> hubs<00:00:49.610> on<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.940> front

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
because of the manual hubs on the front

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.869 
because of the manual hubs on the front
so<00:00:50.600> here<00:00:51.290> we<00:00:51.410> go

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.470 

get<00:00:56.420> onto<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.780> freeway<00:00:57.019> we<00:00:57.410> calibrated<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
get onto the freeway we calibrated the

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.830 
get onto the freeway we calibrated the
speedometer<00:00:59.480> so<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.170> is

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
speedometer so it is

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.259 
speedometer so it is
reset<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.870> trips<00:01:03.350> we<00:01:03.620> can

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
reset the trips we can

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.899 
reset the trips we can
get<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.869> more<00:01:05.320> accurate<00:01:05.909> miles-per-gallon

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
get a more accurate miles-per-gallon

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.500 
get a more accurate miles-per-gallon

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.260 

I'll<00:01:20.790> run<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> G

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.429 

and<00:01:28.390> we're<00:01:28.780> 70<00:01:29.530> miles

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
and we're 70 miles

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.450 
and we're 70 miles
so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.230 

great<00:01:34.060> power<00:01:34.330> great<00:01:34.780> torque<00:01:36.000> never<00:01:37.000> would

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
great power great torque never would

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.410 
great power great torque never would
have<00:01:37.300> been<00:01:37.420> able<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.920> outpace<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.420> GMC

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
have been able to outpace that GMC

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:49.230 
have been able to outpace that GMC
pickup<00:01:40.920> behind<00:01:41.920> us<00:01:42.190> coming<00:01:42.880> up<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.300> on-ramp

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.250 

Tork<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.049> diesel<00:01:50.470> is

Tork of the diesel is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.920 
Tork of the diesel is
fantastic

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
fantastic

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.380 
fantastic
this<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.230> going<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.470> be<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.590> great<00:01:55.390> great

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
this is going to be a great great

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.110 
this is going to be a great great
vehicle<00:01:56.690> to<00:01:56.960> cruise

vehicle to cruise

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.240 
vehicle to cruise
should<00:01:59.450> knock<00:01:59.750> down<00:02:00.050> pretty<00:02:00.440> good<00:02:00.500> mileage<00:02:00.920> on

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
should knock down pretty good mileage on

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.570 
should knock down pretty good mileage on
the<00:02:01.370> freeway

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the freeway

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.250 
the freeway
as<00:02:03.700> well<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.120> just<00:02:04.150> being<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.690> heck<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.140> lot

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
as well as just being a heck of a lot

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.670 
as well as just being a heck of a lot
more<00:02:05.320> fun<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.890> drive<00:02:07.050> with<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.290> diesel

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
more fun to drive with the diesel

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.290 
more fun to drive with the diesel
because<00:02:08.920> you

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
because you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.620 
because you
shift<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.660> lot<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.930> years<00:02:11.230> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
shift a lot of years and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.680 
shift a lot of years and
a<00:02:13.750> lot<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.200> power<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.070> tour

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.430 

so<00:02:17.870> far<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.410> conversion<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.130> very<00:02:20.440> very

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
so far this conversion is very very

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.380 
so far this conversion is very very
rewarding

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.330 

things<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.319> finished<00:02:25.710> off<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.190> can

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
things that we we finished off you can

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.050 
things that we we finished off you can
see<00:02:26.520> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:26.940> here<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.010 

center<00:02:31.270> console<00:02:31.780> added<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.739> nice

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.530 

really<00:02:35.350> lacking<00:02:35.620> cupholders<00:02:36.460> as<00:02:37.150> well<00:02:37.360> as

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
really lacking cupholders as well as

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.820 
really lacking cupholders as well as
trip<00:02:37.960> down<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.860> rest

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
trip down the rest

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.160 
trip down the rest
there's<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.250> some<00:02:40.520> some<00:02:41.300> stock<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.840> hearing

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
there's with some some stock of hearing

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.289 
there's with some some stock of hearing
boobs

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.660 

try<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> make<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.230> conversion<00:02:46.650> as<00:02:47.099> seamless

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
try to make this conversion as seamless

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.970 
try to make this conversion as seamless
as<00:02:47.700> we

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.340 

so<00:02:55.940> I've<00:02:56.060> got<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> little<00:02:56.450> vibration<00:02:57.290> about<00:02:57.819> 77

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.050 

probably<00:03:03.980> wouldn't<00:03:04.160> want<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> run<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.730> miles

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
probably wouldn't want to run a miles

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.590 
probably wouldn't want to run a miles
now<00:03:05.360> our<00:03:05.570> all<00:03:05.810> day<00:03:06.110> long<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:07.300> bring<00:03:08.300> it<00:03:08.390> back

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
now our all day long but bring it back

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.760 
now our all day long but bring it back
down

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
down

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.520 
down
75<00:03:10.580> is<00:03:10.850> really<00:03:11.300> smooth

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
75 is really smooth

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.210 
75 is really smooth
33

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
33

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.280 
33
to<00:03:14.580> put<00:03:14.760> all<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.300> perspective<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:16.140> got

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to put all this in perspective we got

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.699 
to put all this in perspective we got
four<00:03:16.620> inches<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:17.100> lift<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.640> 35<00:03:18.060> inch<00:03:18.300> tires<00:03:18.600> so

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
four inches of lift and 35 inch tires so

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.979 
four inches of lift and 35 inch tires so
eighty<00:03:21.250> miles<00:03:21.519> an<00:03:21.790> hour<00:03:21.939> with<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.299> gas<00:03:22.569> motor

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
eighty miles an hour with the gas motor

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.750 
eighty miles an hour with the gas motor
and<00:03:23.439> porridge<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.579> a<00:03:24.609> lift
