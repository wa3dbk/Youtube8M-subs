00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.019
 we see the process on the ground 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.780
 expenses for marinating carnation flowers a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 bit of wild cinnamon then we have 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 collected here in the garden behind that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 of the rosemary saga and also of love 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.070
 now we will make it but we prepare cereal 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 we already cut them on the skin 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 so that the marinade succeeds in 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.699
 penetrate better inside the skin 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.359

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.560
 right but we will not cook this 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.409
 but we assume we say that at least one seo 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.880
 elections like just asking for holden 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.340
