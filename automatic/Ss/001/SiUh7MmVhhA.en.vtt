00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.809 
is a ditch and this must be some sort of
bug<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:59.710> why<00:01:00.710> similar<00:01:01.010> has<00:01:01.219> less<00:01:01.550> if<00:01:01.699> you

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
bug that why similar has less if you

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.600 
bug that why similar has less if you
guys<00:01:01.999> have<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.539> or<00:01:02.719> not<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.859> airport<00:01:04.339> is

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610

called<00:01:05.360> like<00:01:06.080> JEP<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:07.010> think<00:01:07.730> I'd<00:01:07.940> have<00:01:08.090> to

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
called like JEP it I think I'd have to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.740 
called like JEP it I think I'd have to
check<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:08.570> one<00:01:08.900> out<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:13.360> code<00:01:14.360> for

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
check that one out and it's a code for

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.730 
check that one out and it's a code for
its<00:01:17.750> ID<00:01:18.080> is<00:01:18.520> five<00:01:19.520> Papa<00:01:20.420> November<00:01:20.930> 7<00:01:21.410> that's<00:01:21.560> 5

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
its ID is five Papa November 7 that's 5

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.740 
its ID is five Papa November 7 that's 5
p<00:01:22.550> &amp;<00:01:22.880> 7<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.740> can<00:01:24.950> give<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.370> look<00:01:25.660> it's<00:01:26.660> a

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
p &amp; 7 and you can give it a look it's a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520 
p &amp; 7 and you can give it a look it's a
very<00:01:26.990> interesting<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:28.420> think<00:01:29.420> because

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
very interesting I think because

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
very interesting I think because
it's<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.970> boating<00:01:33.770> like<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:36.830> don't<00:01:37.830> know<00:01:39.170> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's just boating like I don't know it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.230 
it's just boating like I don't know it's
also<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.680> challenging<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.940> bug

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
also pretty challenging if this is a bug

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
also pretty challenging if this is a bug
