success to a combination of factors

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.529 
success to a combination of factors
because<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:17.010> definitely<00:00:17.340> had<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> lot<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.390> on

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
because it definitely had a lot going on

maybe<00:00:28.050> Bioshock<00:00:28.769> also<00:00:29.099> marked<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.369> big<00:00:29.580> step

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

look at the water in its opening
sequence<00:00:33.719> still<00:00:34.230> totally<00:00:34.739> holds<00:00:34.980> up

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
sequence still totally holds up

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310

then<00:00:35.520> there's<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> audio<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.020> don't

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
then there's the audio which I don't

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.049 
then there's the audio which I don't
know<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.680> listen<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.980> it

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.299 

see<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.570> creepy<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.649> think<00:00:43.950> Bioshock

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
see it's creepy but I think Bioshock

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610 
see it's creepy but I think Bioshock
owes<00:00:44.489> his<00:00:44.760> success<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.719> specific<00:00:46.079> reason

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
owes his success to one specific reason

the setting Bioshock was one of the
first<00:00:49.140> games<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.890> environmental

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
first games to do environmental

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700

storytelling<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.780> setting<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> real

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
storytelling well the setting is a real

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
storytelling well the setting is a real
character<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> game<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> Bioshock<00:00:54.960> 1<00:00:55.170> and

character in the game and Bioshock 1 and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
character in the game and Bioshock 1 and
too<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> suspense<00:00:56.460> stems<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
too much of the suspense stems from the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.209 
too much of the suspense stems from the
question<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> how<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> Art<00:00:58.289> Deco<00:00:58.440> world<00:00:59.010> of

rapture came to be the ruins it is when
you<00:01:01.800> arrive<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.670> impossible<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> wonder

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you arrive it's impossible not to wonder

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
you arrive it's impossible not to wonder
how<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.939> puzzling

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
how it got to be this way but puzzling

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810 
how it got to be this way but puzzling
settings<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.530> puzzles<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.640> how

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
settings are just that puzzles so how

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
settings are just that puzzles so how
does<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.240> setting<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.689> Bioshock<00:01:10.170> actually

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
does the setting of Bioshock actually

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
does the setting of Bioshock actually
make<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> great<00:01:11.700> game<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> here's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
make it the great game that it is here's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.240 
make it the great game that it is here's
the<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.500> setting<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.070> know

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the thing about a good setting you know

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.890 
the thing about a good setting you know
it's<00:01:14.460> nice<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.000> never<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.869> think

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it's nice when you never have to think

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.010 
it's nice when you never have to think
about<00:01:16.290> why<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> works<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.580> does<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.689> video

games with interesting architecture but

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.790 
games with interesting architecture but

Bioshock stands alone and that both of

these things are the same and that's

these things are the same and that's
what<00:06:37.020> makes<00:06:37.170> Bioshock<00:06:37.620> so<00:06:37.890> special<00:06:38.460> it's

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
what makes Bioshock so special it's

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.730 
what makes Bioshock so special it's
setting<00:06:39.240> does<00:06:39.390> so<00:06:39.660> much<00:06:39.840> work<00:06:40.140> for<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.530> game

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
setting does so much work for the game

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.890 
setting does so much work for the game
and<00:06:41.010> the<00:06:41.430> player<00:06:41.730> but<00:06:42.240> it's<00:06:42.390> so<00:06:42.510> harmonious

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
and the player but it's so harmonious

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.140 
and the player but it's so harmonious
that<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.590> never<00:06:43.830> calls<00:06:44.190> attention<00:06:44.520> to<00:06:44.760> itself

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
that it never calls attention to itself

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
so what do you think did you pick up on

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.560 
so what do you think did you pick up on
the<00:06:46.980> interplay<00:06:47.460> between<00:06:47.490> architecture<00:06:48.420> and
