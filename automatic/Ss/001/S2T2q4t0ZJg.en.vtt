00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
does everything to be fair the coins the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
does everything to be fair the coins the
Batarang<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.120> coins<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.570> Batarang<00:01:15.960> will

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
Batarang the coins and the Batarang will

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.390 
Batarang the coins and the Batarang will
look<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> ones<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.220> any

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
look like the ones that you get any

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.330 
look like the ones that you get any
other<00:01:17.720> replicas<00:01:18.720> although<00:01:19.230> those<00:01:19.860> ones<00:01:20.130> are

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
other replicas although those ones are

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.070 
other replicas although those ones are
easy<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.820> pop<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.300> play<00:01:21.480> with<00:01:21.660> this<00:01:21.870> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
easy to pop out and play with this one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
easy to pop out and play with this one
is<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.410> so<00:01:22.590> easy<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> bits<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
is not so easy to get the bits out so I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.150 
is not so easy to get the bits out so I
think<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> Batarang<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.530> same<00:01:25.770> looks<00:01:26.010> the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
think the Batarang is the same looks the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.930 
think the Batarang is the same looks the
same<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:27.840> surprised<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> wasn't<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
same be surprised if it wasn't and the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.690 
same be surprised if it wasn't and the
Joker<00:01:30.540> cards<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.980> all<00:01:32.160> look<00:01:32.370> like<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
Joker cards and they all look like the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.790 
Joker cards and they all look like the
movie<00:01:32.970> versions<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.930> lovely<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
movie versions which is lovely so

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.040 
movie versions which is lovely so
they've<00:01:35.160> done<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.370> good<00:01:35.610> job<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
they've done a really good job on it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.930 
they've done a really good job on it
good<00:01:37.050> quality<00:01:37.470> print<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.250> characters<00:01:38.820> in

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
good quality print of the characters in

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.190 
good quality print of the characters in
the<00:01:39.030> background<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.780> looks<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.080> business

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the background so it looks the business

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
the background so it looks the business
on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> wall<00:01:43.790> back<00:01:45.320> quick<00:01:46.320> luck<00:01:46.470> happen

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 

hangs<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.980> to<00:01:50.250> mounts<00:01:50.730> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
hangs on to mounts a little bit of a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
hangs on to mounts a little bit of a
theft<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.260> hang<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.300> see<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
theft to hang up you can see that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.800 
theft to hang up you can see that
everything<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.380> mounted<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.700> screws<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
everything is mounted with screws the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
everything is mounted with screws the
backing<00:02:00.810> board<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.230> screwed<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.220> theory

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
backing board is screwed in so in theory

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360 
backing board is screwed in so in theory
the<00:02:02.820> game<00:02:03.030> play<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.840> toys<00:02:04.080> if<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
the game play with all the toys if you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.770 
the game play with all the toys if you
wanted<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.120> kind<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.360> defeats<00:02:06.690> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
wanted to but that kind of defeats the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.249 
wanted to but that kind of defeats the
point<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.320> prop<00:02:07.590> collection

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
point of this prop collection

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.009 
point of this prop collection
it's<00:02:08.830> made<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.069> be<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.399> nice<00:02:09.580> display<00:02:10.019> looks

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
it's made to be a nice display looks

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.039 
it's made to be a nice display looks
like<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> nice<00:02:11.800> display<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:12.549> my<00:02:13.510> personal

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
like a nice display so my personal

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.240 
like a nice display so my personal
choice<00:02:14.260> would<00:02:14.440> be<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.560> leave<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.099> wall

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
choice would be to leave it on the wall

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.420 
choice would be to leave it on the wall
wait<00:02:15.849> looks<00:02:16.090> good<00:02:16.299> so<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.409> go<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.129> can
