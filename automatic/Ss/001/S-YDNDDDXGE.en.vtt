00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.039

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.260
 will finish 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.149
 the season finale on Saturday against 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.430
 Sportvereinigung Unterhaching was therefore 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.260
 my last game in professional football and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.909
 represent the conclusion of my career 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.629
 I'll be 40 in the coming week 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.010
 years old our big goal was to rise in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.040
 we have the second league prematurely 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.009
 also managed the cup victory and on 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.409
 Saturday , we will hopefully also the 

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.000
 championship there is hardly one 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.600
 better time to his career too 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.290
 break up 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.270
 because me and because what's called one 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 well-known proverb you should 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 stop when it's the most beautiful 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.240
 as far as I do I have the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.799
 past seven years as a player 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.530
 This one was very much enjoyed 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.110
 despite the constant pro despite the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.479
 constant professionalization is one 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.600
 certain family family atmosphere 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.150
 always partly been and will be 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 hopefully remain so in the future 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.850
 That's why I want to stand here 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.799
 again with club and to the trainer and 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 supervisor team and all my players 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.600
 Thank you for this great time together 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 Of course, thank you very much 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.590
 family and my friends in me 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.590
 have always supported my career 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.729
 go together 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 that is a thank you is questionable 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:19.200
 so that all the time we have an extreme 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:21.209
 thanks to the biggest first choice for us after 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:37.080
 many many in vain try us 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:42.060
 on the other hand, that in may 2010 we have a clear 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:47.010
 representation resisted as much success comes 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.360
 to what achieves everything what has to be there 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.390
 have already made to say 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 Therefore , before your performance 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.440
 player bigger than human and the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.220
 border issue again was a lobby 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.220
 crazy because she currently has the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.500
 step is right 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.050
 it is now, so to speak, the 40 years 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.400
 at the height of the cult family 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.120
 athlete doing business 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.200
 A big step is to do something like that 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:36.109
 would be up-to- date but we have 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:38.329
 now put some and you became 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.599
 gradually these tasks together 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.189
 you intimate as we all are 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.349
 This is also a new one for me 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.620
 chance 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.060
 that's why i'm looking forward to institut 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.609
 It's a great player and I'm happy 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.139
 also on further cooperation 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:04:01.680
 respective offer successfully made 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:07.519
 In the case schmidt is a kind of someone in the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:12.959
 there can be so much change from there 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:18.440
 task in july on such important goals 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.459
 missed unlike the role play 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.900
 then found 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.900
 this new challenge 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.039
 then have to
