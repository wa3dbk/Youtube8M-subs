definitely use highest it's definitely

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.170 
definitely use highest it's definitely
the<00:00:28.140> highest<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.529> EU<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> no

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
the highest in EU right now there is no

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.479 
the highest in EU right now there is no
one<00:00:30.360> with<00:00:30.450> a<00:00:30.509> higher<00:00:30.720> KD<00:00:31.020> in<00:00:31.290> EU<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.919> with<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
one with a higher KD in EU and with a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.970 
one with a higher KD in EU and with a
respectable<00:00:32.880> win-loss<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.390> well<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.380> we're

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
respectable win-loss as well so we're

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.170 
respectable win-loss as well so we're
gonna<00:00:35.070> jump<00:00:35.310> into<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.910> show<00:00:36.000> you
