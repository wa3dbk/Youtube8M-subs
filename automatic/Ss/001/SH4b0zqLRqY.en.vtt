00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
they look let enough like natural and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
they look let enough like natural and
for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> eyes<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.759> know<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.899> like

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
for the eyes I just know it's very like

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.920 
for the eyes I just know it's very like
bright<00:02:01.500> eyed<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.369> did<00:02:02.790> false<00:02:03.360> eyelashes

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
bright eyed and so I did false eyelashes

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230 
bright eyed and so I did false eyelashes
and<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.259> am<00:02:04.619> NOT<00:02:04.890> good<00:02:05.310> with<00:02:05.340> false<00:02:05.700> eyelashes

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and I am NOT good with false eyelashes

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.860 
and I am NOT good with false eyelashes
I'm<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.689> worst<00:02:06.899> at<00:02:07.290> putting<00:02:07.469> them<00:02:07.619> in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
I'm the worst at putting them in

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.980 
I'm the worst at putting them in
never<00:02:08.200> put<00:02:08.470> them<00:02:08.619> on<00:02:08.770> for<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.550> video<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.300> tried

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
never put them on for a video I tried

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.140 
never put them on for a video I tried
and<00:02:11.290> then<00:02:11.380> had<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.680> just<00:02:11.890> take<00:02:12.580> them<00:02:12.730> off<00:02:12.850> and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
and then had to just take them off and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.480 
and then had to just take them off and
do<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.720> without<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.620> hopefully<00:02:14.860> these<00:02:15.190> look

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
do it without it so hopefully these look

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.610 
do it without it so hopefully these look
like<00:02:15.520> they're<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:16.000> good<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.660> don't<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.350> I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
like they're in good I don't know I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.170 
like they're in good I don't know I
don't<00:02:17.710> know<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.280> kind<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.640> God<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:18.880> got

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
don't know if it's the kind of God I got

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.230 
don't know if it's the kind of God I got
him<00:02:19.300> from<00:02:19.390> target<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:21.460> never<00:02:21.790> look<00:02:22.060> right

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
him from target I just never look right

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.610 
him from target I just never look right
I've<00:02:22.360> even<00:02:22.540> tried<00:02:22.600> trimming<00:02:23.020> out<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.350> stuff

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
I've even tried trimming out and stuff

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.700 
I've even tried trimming out and stuff
but<00:02:24.240> anyway<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.630> for<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.020> eyes<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.380> just<00:02:26.560> did

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
but anyway and for the eyes I just did

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.860 
but anyway and for the eyes I just did
them<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.520> white<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.210> bright<00:02:28.510> and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
them really like white and bright and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.650 
them really like white and bright and
the<00:02:29.380> color<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.190> chose<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.700> do<00:02:30.880> for<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.210> eyes<00:02:31.360> is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
the color I chose to do for the eyes is

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.710 
the color I chose to do for the eyes is
like<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:32.160> kind<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> plum<00:02:33.760> color<00:02:34.090> because

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
like a kind of like a plum color because

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.050 
like a kind of like a plum color because
that's<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.050> color<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.350> her<00:02:36.010> outfit<00:02:36.850> in<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
that's the color of her outfit in the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.570 
that's the color of her outfit in the
movie<00:02:37.270> she<00:02:37.390> has<00:02:37.480> like<00:02:37.630> red<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.710> like<00:02:39.550> a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
movie she has like red on and like a

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.900 
movie she has like red on and like a
plum<00:02:40.140> sleeves<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.560> gold<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.220> stuff<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.880> I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
plum sleeves and gold and stuff so I

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.430 
plum sleeves and gold and stuff so I
thought<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.600> palm<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:43.990> look<00:02:44.110> really<00:02:44.320> good

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
thought the palm would look really good

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.280 
thought the palm would look really good
it's<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.700> snow<00:02:45.940> white<00:02:46.120> eyeshadow<00:02:46.510> thing

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
it's like the snow white eyeshadow thing

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.510 
it's like the snow white eyeshadow thing
so<00:02:48.420> hopefully<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.630> often<00:02:49.750> see<00:02:50.110> in<00:02:50.520> everything

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
so hopefully I often see in everything

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.010 
so hopefully I often see in everything
and<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.970> did<00:02:52.120> really<00:02:52.300> rosy<00:02:52.540> cheeks<00:02:52.870> you

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
and I did really rosy cheeks you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.080 
and I did really rosy cheeks you
probably<00:02:53.380> can't<00:02:53.740> tell<00:02:53.980> because<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.730> window

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
