 disappears and my life 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 one 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.180
 this tuning means that we start 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.369
 the space the life of a space that you 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.680
 we offer every Wednesday and that 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:05.229
 we know more closely the life of a 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.960
 important person the bible has made 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.330
 great things has made things bad 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.399
 there is all the bible and in this space 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.619
 we will present it to you with the character 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.940
 biblical of the day in this case we are going to 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.940
 talk about aznar 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.180
 the sincere compliments of an opponent are 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.430
 often the best way to measure the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.800
 greatness of someone and is what we could 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.810
 stand out in this afternoon even though a 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.970
 MÃ©rida bis met frequently 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.950
 through the battle lines the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.780
 bible gives us a brief sketch of the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.780
 respect they had for each other 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.670
 no no 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.730
 when young David served under the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.680
 ander orders but later this one 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.990
 carried out the health campaign for 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.630
 kill David after the death of 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.090
 Saul Amner temporarily maintained the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.740
 power the king's family but the fight 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.010
 between amner and the heir of saul 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.959
 exposed originated that anr decided to support 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.390
 the claim for the throne from part of 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.430
 David was during these efforts for 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.970
 unite the kingdom that ander was killed 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.970
 by am 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.010
 all right 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.120
 several years before in a battle between 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.040
 dis army has under the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.830
 Abner's orders and the forces of David 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.960
 commanded by playing amner fled and was 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.570
 pursued by him the brother of 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.880
 john amner warned him in two 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.490
 occasions that I will stop pursuing him but 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.560
 the impatient and young soldier refused to 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.780
 yes what to do killed him 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.780
 Jobs had proposed to avenge his brother 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.460
 ander realized that the family of 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.710
 Saul was predestined to defeat and 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.050
 that davis would be the next king so 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.520
 decided to change sides I expected that 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.380
 change to deliver the kingdom of Saul 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.780
 david made him commander-in-chief of 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.090
 his army the disposition of david for 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.610
 accept this proposition was such that 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.970
 another reason for the action of jacob for 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.190
 try to kill him amner lived for his 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.590
 wit and by his will for the god 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.810
 was someone to cooperate with and so 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.300
 he entered his plans in another way 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.910
 he did what seemed best to him 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.740
 at that moment we can identify 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.080
 with the arnet tendency to cooperate 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.820
 Conditionally obedience to God 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.380
 it's easy when the instructions of the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.290
 word 'god' are embedded in our 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.850
 plans but our fidelity to God is 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.250
 puts to the test when your plans are 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.800
 contrary to ours the question 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.420
 that we do what action should take 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.420
 today in obedience to the word of God 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.840
 to have had strengths and also 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.970
 got achievements was commander in chief 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.820
 of Saul's army and military leader 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.860
 able kept israel together for several 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.320
 years during the government of the weak king 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.540
 Chris Bosh &amp; also recognized and accepted 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.990
 God's plan to make David the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.060
 king of all Israeli from Judah 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.680
 just like it has strengths and 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.020
 achievements because it also has an 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.060
 weaknesses and errors was motivated by 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.280
 selfishness in their efforts to reunite 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.470
 Israeli play in place of a convention 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.450
 Divine slept with one of the concubines 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.760
 of royalty after the death of 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.280
 Saul and he also had elections in his 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.540
 very important life is one of them god 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.640
 it requires more than a cooperation 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.640
 conditional and without enthusiasm 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.009
