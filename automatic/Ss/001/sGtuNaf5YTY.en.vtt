00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.370
 Forget the time you took 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.899
 various books and other books 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.719
 supplies for school 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.610
 today all of this fits inside a tablet 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 pencil case with pen and eraser 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.369
 was also replaced by this device 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.130
 and you know that time-wasting situation 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.650
 to copy the subject of the picture forget 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.869
 just hit a photo and attach a file 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 of class and will bring the books to class 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.660
 through the notebooks for fear of not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.210
 get 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 I think first day second on the second day 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.809
 was already on a tablet or did not bring 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.270
 the sayings there was nothing like that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.520
 exactly all the didactic material is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.010
 stored on the school website and the student 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.440
 you can download it anytime 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 and even split the tablet screen 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.539
 to resolve any issues or take 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 the teacher also commands the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.010
 through a tablet and the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.629
 presentation goes straight at the screen and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.780
 student equipment 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.940
 but if you think it 's just that no matter 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.820
 There is still much more to it. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 Bruno learns by joking that he is the leader of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.780
 a mathematical game that tests the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.640
 knowledge of the students and identifies 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
 themes in which they have better and worse 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 performance is the evolution of the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 homework 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.299
 I find it easier because it is a form of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.950
 teacher to interact more with students 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.189
 I do not stay alone in that business . 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 talk explain we pull but the tension 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.009
 help focus, but technology does not 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.320
 stops on tablets portals or applications 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.909
 're seeing these glasses here seem 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.500
 those we use when I attended 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.720
 a 3d movie in the cinema 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 only here in the place of the film the students 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.420
 attend classes in three dimensions and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.119
 can be either with or without glasses with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.909
 the animations right on the screen everything stays 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.970
 much more real and learning every time 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.250
 easier and more technological for those who 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.979
 The pre-university entrance exam also has a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.990
 mounts evidence of the enemy or the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.939
 Southern universities of the country 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.140
 the student can know the time it took 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.180
 to answer the questions 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 to improve their performance technology 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.540
 it's being the way I've been 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 cell phone in the room has a staff teacher 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.869
 take the cell phone do a search now 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.680
 we have wifi internet in all 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.140
 rooms 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.350
 this automatically generates discussion generates 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 a very grandiose moment of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.130
 learning
