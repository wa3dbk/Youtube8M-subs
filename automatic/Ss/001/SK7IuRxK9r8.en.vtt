00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 how friends of youtube today teaches them 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.910
 to play reik's winter these songs 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
 of those old ladies but that is super 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.389
 good to dedicate to someone special already 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.250
 you know we have video demonstration of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.960
 this side and letter of chords in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.389
 christian dotcom down here in the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 information I leave the link so 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.210
 ok let's start perfect nation 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.699
 standard and field in the fourth fret if 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.769
 they do not have field with a pencil and back in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.260
 strong strong reality that fits well 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.260
 strong girls how we started 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.910
 perfect let's start first with 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.460
 stanza and the intro that is exactly 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.080
 even this is repeated in the stanzas 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 let's use chords with fifth 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.210
 check yourself in the case of the most we are going to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.740
 play now well two strings that would be 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.380
 fifth and fourth with the number one finger 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.930
 we play on the second second string 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.250
 fret and they are pure taps down 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.250
 computer but in my other one we recharge this 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.140
 part of the hand at the beginning almost of the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.810
 ropes 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.070
 ok not here because it does not sound 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.070
 to be almost at the beginning there 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.580
 then we will use a falcon 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.950
 fifth also nothing more than two ropes 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.350
 chicken seal like I do to have a 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.450
 little more comfort then with video 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.970
 number one and with my finger number four 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.070
 they can also do it with the three me 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.409
 here I do it sixth string first fret 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 and 5th string third fret can 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.960
 do as I say or with your finger 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.960
 number four 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.500
 ok I prefer to do it with 4 for 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.260
 have a little more open hand more 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.590
 Loose after we're going to do a do with 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.629
 fifth 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 this if we have to do it with our finger 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.209
 number 1 and with the 4 hour I explain them 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.310
 because we play fifth string third 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.290
 fret and fourth string fifth fret 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.069
 then here we leave this finger 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.190
 here the little one and we cross the finger 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.590
 number one nothing but a fret to the second 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.739
 okay it would be second fret fifth string 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.739
 this is a sun with a pat down itself 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.620
 ok and nothing else are pure blows to 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.280
 down is not going to be very slow so that what 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:12.600
 go rehearsing 321 swims down 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:18.970
 taps change we repeat change 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.800
 perfect change let's start with the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.650
 first verse and today is teaching them the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.650
 part of the 321 choir 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:56.340
 we repeated fa did not change 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.750
 there the choir immediately enters 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.750
 this we are going to use 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.600
 my minor 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.690
 Bah 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.840
 and the smaller the fast is the tun tun 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.080
 dantÃ¡n chucu we have used it a lot tun 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.280
 you down below down so up and up 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.280
 bottom up 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.360
 slower 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.879
 and we make the change we are going to do it with 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.879
 each chord 3 2 1 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.139
 so so 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.820
 Y 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.180
 and so much 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.289
 so so 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.289
 so so 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.120
 perfect now we are going to do it with the 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.740
 choir does not realize that we stay 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.740
 for the last part of stanza 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.759
 the least 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.850
 avoid 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:51.020
 ok takes many nuances as well as for 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.030
 do it like you're missing here in the 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.520
 awards and when I get to the choir it's the 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.350
 ponchis all the and in the song ok I'm going to 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.449
 do a little bit slower if not 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.880
 they checked the change because here after 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:06.020
 we pass network and it is a change nothing more 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.790
 fast 2 sun ok or be again slower 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.790
 3 2 1 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.270
 we came 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.200
 my minor 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.590
 again going has the hook that told them 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.930
 re minor 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.760
 a sun 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:46.670
 of melo 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:48.950
 we ended up in perfect winter 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.050
 we have all the rhythms and all the 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.790
 chords and now more is a matter of which 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.660
 check now if the letter in my 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.130
 page has some variants in some 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.410
 dating parties but so not 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.910
 confuse them learn to be first well 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.250
 well well the rhythms that the 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.260
 song the hair and the strum and already 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.210
 then they consult well the letter with the 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.490
 demo video so that they would learn to 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.830
