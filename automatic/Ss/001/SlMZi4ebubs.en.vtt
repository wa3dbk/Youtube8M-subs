00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
you know I can do this on the bench you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.490 
you know I can do this on the bench you
can<00:01:49.369> do<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.880> on<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.180> sled<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.080> trick<00:01:51.290> is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
can do this on the sled the trick is

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.290 
can do this on the sled the trick is
when<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.070> your<00:01:52.310> spindles<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> sled

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
when you have your spindles on the sled

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.210 
when you have your spindles on the sled
just<00:01:53.810> put<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> skis<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.800> just<00:01:55.010> let<00:01:55.130> the

just put the skis in and just let the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.560 
just put the skis in and just let the
weight<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.580> sled<00:01:55.820> push<00:01:56.060> down<00:01:56.240> then<00:01:56.479> the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
weight of the sled push down then the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:06.240 
weight of the sled push down then the
bolt<00:01:56.750> will<00:01:56.869> go<00:01:56.990> through<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.229> little<00:01:57.440> easier

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.859 

I'll<00:02:07.250> be<00:02:07.430> using<00:02:07.700> these<00:02:07.790> skis<00:02:08.090> on<00:02:08.270> another<00:02:08.540> sled

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869
