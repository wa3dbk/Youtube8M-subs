from carl zeiss a few years ago we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
from carl zeiss a few years ago we

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
switch the real challenge was that it's

fit<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.520> perfectly<00:00:57.030> yeah<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
fit here perfectly yeah I think what it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.549 
fit here perfectly yeah I think what it
did<00:00:58.590> we've<00:00:59.219> missed<00:00:59.989> testing<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.170> quality

isn't<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.100> easy<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> part<00:01:03.449> consists<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> two

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
isn't so easy the part consists of two
