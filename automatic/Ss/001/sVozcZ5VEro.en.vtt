 we put a container under the crankcase 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.070
 of the engine to collect used oil 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.869
 with the help of a suitable tool 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.550

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.550

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.570
 remember to remove the top cap of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.570

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.890

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.890

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.570
 A recommendation do not tighten or re remove 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.470
