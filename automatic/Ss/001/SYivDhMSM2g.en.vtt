00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.619
 Hello guys 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 today a review of this machine here this 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.259
 dream game, right? 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.430
 this machine is the rui here interior 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.090
 of mine mines 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.269
 he is he retired and decided to ride 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.300
 a game machine and for editing too 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.850
 among other resources 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.739
 he made me a consultant 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.710
 we analyzed his profile 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.079
 I created the configuration and he decided 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 buy the equipment with me and I did 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.379
 This work here is going to show you 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.360
 the equipment itself and some details 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.170
 exclusive of what I do 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.440
 sure that the equipment has a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 totti panel to track the fans 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.360
 front and the film and top is also 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.509
 that Rui wanted control of the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.179
 speed if he wanted a computer 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.479
 The quieter one had a colder day. 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.680
 It's hotter to control all this. 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 controller 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.619
 he controls four fans and has the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.790
 possibility ned increase decrease 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.140
 speed is another detail as 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.700
 you can see what good a slug 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.820
 before the machine is fully 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.450
 organized and affixed has nothing 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 swinging nothing loose nor is it stuck 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.540
 the whole system made with 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 the well- organized clamp fixed 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.399
 correctly is the machine I've already 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.860
 I left ready for you to call 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.020
 another hd that he has in his residence 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.200
 that he will put on the machine I 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.320
 I already left all the cables in the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.049
 exact point of it simply put the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.670
 hd and connect the two paths of the 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:21.780
 machine is literally everything perfect 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.949
 with the assembly and configuration of everything is 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.750
 on the side here as you can see 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.690
 a personal lighting 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.930
 laughter appears however that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.290
 disposal is an exclusive system that I 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.590
 I want it, I created it for PC, it goes with 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.710
 the remote control where the person can 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.170
 change the color you want until you have all the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.250
 colors here I did on my machine 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 Also this system as an example , right and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.650
 my clients did not like the service 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.540
 and decided to do too 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.280
 Then you ask but I already have one. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.010
 computer would like to have the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.320
 just get in touch with the email dac 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.680
 in the video description I can do 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.680
 the exact design for your equipment 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.040
 Okay, the design is ready, you can 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.380
 Send me the cap of the machine. I'll do the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.700
 complete installation and send it to you 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.160
 Back all this is talked about in a way 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.040
 simplify the most for you in there 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.830
 how can you see everything organized 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.480
 all cables have no cable at all 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.340
 loose or anything like that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.080
 the cover is only open on the other side 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.269
 It was to show you 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.790
 right here you can change the colors 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.670
 There's a system she keeps changing. 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.670
 Alone you can change the speed 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.360
 also in that flash has a system 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.160
 faith that he is changing the colors of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.160
 gradual form 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.310
 as you are seeing here in slow that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.049
 It's already in the white light that she lights up 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.420
 and erasing right and has the flash is that it is 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.060
 changing I did not particularly notice 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.079
 much difference from smooth to flash 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.970
 It's there you can turn off the lighting. 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.549
 and remembering that this vgl has a 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.660
 more detail that she lights on her 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.419
 also and has is and critical systems site 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.700
 stop in the region since this 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.850
 video system has a cooling system as 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.160
 good that she turns off the fans when 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.460
 plate is not hot is in a 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.770
 temperature below, there is no 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.840
 normal temperature it turns off the fans 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.249
 as in that case they are 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.859
 turned off at the time 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:46.859
 requires more performance those two 

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:51.509
 Lights out there and the courses start. 

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:54.799
 to run is the system here only point the 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:58.249
 control will have the complete kit or as 

00:04:54.799 --> 00:05:00.389
 interested in assembling the machine 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.929
 interested in buying I wanted to 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.689
 configuration and have this type of service 

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:10.289
 totally exclusive reminder that the 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:13.019
 assembly of this machine was about three days 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.989
 service here I already have the machine 

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:19.739
 fully ready with the system all 

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:22.139
 more and even opted for a super monitor 

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:29.879
 light is the ultra light which is a 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:32.459
 resolution of 2560 per 1080 is excellent 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:36.419
 this kind of monitor for whom 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:39.689
 want to work with is more windows 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.809
 open without squeezing it there 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:46.709
 An example is you can work with 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:49.469
 Great using three pages and not three sheets 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:52.679
 at the same time so it is very practical 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.139
 this type of monitor but it has to be 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:59.519
 take into account the need to 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.079
 each one certain because it is not any 

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:04.649
 example for games 

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:07.229
 this resolution requires more 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:11.219
 machine then weighs a little more 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:13.589
 than conventional full HD 1920 by 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.049
 1080 is where a lot of people sometimes the most 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.639
 wheels games with very high performance 

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:20.939
 only sometimes the resolution that you 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.799
 is low and therefore does not require 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:25.559
 both board performance 

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:27.269
 All right, and that's what I treat is 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.969
 specific to all my clients 

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:32.189
 in snacking consulting is where people 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.379
 take away all these doubts 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:37.199
 Okay, I hope you liked my. 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.049
 work is to make sure that the cabinet does not 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.629
 brightens if it is a product that 

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:45.809
 it's the same step in the new cabinet he 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:48.569
 to be more beautiful is that of 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:51.209
 original factory shape right I already 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.759
 I sent the machine with the sensors 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:55.090
 informing the temperature down here 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.460
 person to have 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.150
 control of these temperatures 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.150
 machine 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:05.620
 then it is a completely 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:09.130
 configured to have more performance 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.540
 is to have more features of the rock machine 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.760
 I hope you liked it. 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.130
 interested in hiring in the services is 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.919
 just get the data here in the description of the 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.320
