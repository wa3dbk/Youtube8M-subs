twist<00:00:00.240> and<00:00:00.420> push<00:00:00.539> it<00:00:00.659> at<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.840> same<00:00:01.020> time<00:00:01.319> try

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
twist and push it at the same time try

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.130 
twist and push it at the same time try
to<00:00:01.949> force<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.460> wheel<00:00:02.750> the<00:00:03.750> right<00:00:03.780> over<00:00:05.930> and<00:00:06.930> it

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to force the wheel the right over and it

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.259 
to force the wheel the right over and it
seems<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:08.360> fairly<00:00:10.250> pretty<00:00:11.250> darn<00:00:11.490> clean<00:00:11.820> at

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
seems to be fairly pretty darn clean at

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.320 
seems to be fairly pretty darn clean at
this<00:00:12.450> point<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:15.770> same<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:16.800> here<00:00:17.340> kind<00:00:18.240> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
this point so same thing here kind of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.359 
this point so same thing here kind of
push<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.630> down<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> little<00:00:19.080> bit<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:19.619> see

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
push it down a little bit and then see

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.590 
push it down a little bit and then see
if<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.670> get<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:22.170> right<00:00:22.380> over<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:24.359> far<00:00:24.570> I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
if it can get it to right over so far I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.320 
if it can get it to right over so far I
think<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:24.869> got<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> winner<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:27.140> anyway

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
think I've got a winner here anyway

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
think I've got a winner here anyway
those<00:00:30.330> are<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> tweaks<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.289> did<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
those are some of the tweaks I did to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.900 
those are some of the tweaks I did to
get<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> thing<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.910> function<00:00:33.300> properly<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
get this thing to function properly and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.650 
get this thing to function properly and
now<00:00:35.910> I've<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.290> way<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
now I've got this the way I want to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
now I've got this the way I want to
actually<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.300> working

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
actually now that I have this working

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
actually now that I have this working
the<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> want<00:00:43.579> I'm<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:46.340> actually<00:00:47.340> cut

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the way I want I'm going to actually cut

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
the way I want I'm going to actually cut
the<00:00:47.760> gaps<00:00:48.120> before<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the gaps before I do that I'm going to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.250 
the gaps before I do that I'm going to
put<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> few<00:00:50.399> more<00:00:50.430> spots<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.390> solder<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
put a few more spots of solder here and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.830 
put a few more spots of solder here and
get<00:00:52.710> all<00:00:52.829> solder<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.210> Frog<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.690> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
get all solder on the Frog so it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
get all solder on the Frog so it's
firmly<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.320> place<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.300> I'm<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> gap<00:00:57.780> it

firmly in place and I'm going to gap it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.840 
firmly in place and I'm going to gap it

in place just because I've run of the
problems<00:01:28.140> where<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.710> cutting<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
problems where when I was cutting it

tends to heat the rail I'm you're

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.179 
tends to heat the rail I'm you're
supposed<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> cut<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> fast<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.840> uh<00:01:36.140> but<00:01:37.189> he's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
supposed to cut it fast but uh but he's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
supposed to cut it fast what doesn't

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
supposed to cut it fast what doesn't
heat<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> rails<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.290> melts<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> sauder

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
heat up the rails of melts the sauder

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.210 
heat up the rails of melts the sauder
but<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.689> safe<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.189> keep

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
things engaged I put two pc ties and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
things engaged I put two pc ties and
solar<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> down<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> paranoid

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
solar it down a little bit of paranoid

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.120 
solar it down a little bit of paranoid
my<00:01:50.850> part<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.630> I'd<00:01:51.780> rather<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
my part but I'd rather not have to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.670 
my part but I'd rather not have to
resolder<00:01:53.670> Andrey<00:01:54.210> cage<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.869> reach<00:01:55.079> week<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
resolder Andrey cage and reach week and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.389 
resolder Andrey cage and reach week and
just<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.399> done<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.500> after<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> gap<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
just be done with it so after I gap the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.359 
just be done with it so after I gap the
rails<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:02:00.090> gonna<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> few<00:02:01.500> more<00:02:01.530> spots<00:02:02.100> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
rails I'm gonna put a few more spots of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.109 
rails I'm gonna put a few more spots of
solder<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:03.180> I've<00:02:03.390> only<00:02:04.579> sort<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> pc

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
solder where I've only sort of the pc

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.719 
solder where I've only sort of the pc
ties<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.810> side<00:02:07.220> then<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> cut

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
ties in one side then I'm going to cut

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.199 
ties in one side then I'm going to cut
the<00:02:08.879> foil<00:02:09.619> all<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.860> electrically<00:02:11.670> isolate

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
the foil all right electrically isolate

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
the foil all right electrically isolate
the<00:02:12.360> rails

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the rails

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.750 
the rails
and<00:02:14.330> then<00:02:15.330> before<00:02:16.010> putting<00:02:17.010> solder

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
and then before putting solder

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.320 
and then before putting solder
absolutely<00:02:18.660> everywhere<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.410> thing<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:20.330> am

absolutely everywhere on this thing I am

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.350 
absolutely everywhere on this thing I am
going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:22.040> do<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> preliminary<00:02:23.360> installation

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
going to do a preliminary installation

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.460 
going to do a preliminary installation
on<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.780> location<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.920> my<00:02:26.070> layout<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.260> run<00:02:28.260> an

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
on the location on my layout and run an

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.990 
on the location on my layout and run an
engine<00:02:28.620> through<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.370> how<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.610> coat

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
engine through it and see how that coat

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.990 
engine through it and see how that coat
so<00:02:30.270> maybe<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> short<00:02:30.720> train<00:02:31.490> run<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.610> back<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
so maybe a short train run it back and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.490 
so maybe a short train run it back and
forth<00:02:33.210> backing<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.810> up<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.230> going<00:02:34.470> through

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
forth backing it up and going through

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.100 
forth backing it up and going through
just<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> see<00:02:35.280> really<00:02:36.120> make<00:02:36.450> sure<00:02:36.660> before<00:02:36.900> I
