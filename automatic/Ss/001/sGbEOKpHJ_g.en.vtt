00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:19.050
 it's true after the intro 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.300
 definitely watching the intro 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 manufacturer over if you even 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.199
 or maybe you are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.730
 what can you do abo there 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.289
 let or we would be happy too 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 if we get a bit on board 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.880
 because it is a lot of work we have 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.399
 also hours of skype configure hang 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.300
 and talked to him like that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.010
 should and how we like it best 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 Exactly and you definitely have to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.629
 then look what's over 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.050
 said and in the background you see 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.420
 a gameplay state of black on two 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.160
 my meanwhile favorite cod on 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 In any case I have my time big 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.489
 I just played in that way 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.649
 maneuvers are not yet known 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.989
 Why should not be against big now 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.730
 its not a game park is not everyone 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 actually every black ops every look 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 on jesus call of duty everyone likes it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.470
 otherwise it is it can actually no 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.650
 That's just what you deserve 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 nuclear three minutes 50 approximately 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.890
 and that was actually the gameplay 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.659
 and then we actually come too 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 main now to the main topic that fits 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.340
 now here in a few 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.229
 steps explained fun 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.330
 yes in any case, really good money 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.130
 you can give anybody who 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.110
 nobody is looking anymore today 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.030
 actually the gameplay to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.909
 yes the next topic is definitely 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.220
 Energy tv might say some nix 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 maybe a few is already on everyone 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 case a cool youtuber with i believe 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 five or six thousand subscribers of the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.899
 now has a protégé project 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 made or is I think already over 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.110
 as far as I know 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 you can feel better with me there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 In any case, we also have a video 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.570
 the submitted for our relationships 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.670
 actually pretty good 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.009
 although we always make good videos 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.250
 you have to say that 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.070
 In any case, we would also have fun 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.420
 happy if you stop by 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 he does that anyway 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 I think they look at each other 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.099
 comments 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.690
 or we have one 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.880
 little bit of live will be brought in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.310
 you might then see and then 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.380
 he looks at the lawyers the best 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.599
 place with which he makes such a folding screen 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.760
 and project yes what does that mean now 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.069
 means we are with that a bit 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.120
 interact with us and so on 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.910
 he will probably become our channel 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.590
 Also be there again and we 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.220
 definitely cool on the canal 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 action 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.680
 if all goes well of course it is 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.290
 Of course, they are still far away 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 also determines a lot of other good ones 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.130
 people but if we win 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.000
 should be great super super 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.690
 be happy 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.670
 yes exactly accident your energy tv is not 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 as mature as you know in the clear 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.110
 what mass scorpion are all in there 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.150
 which is there in there is called impact 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.680
 Energy I think all the left you can find 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.420
 in the video description there you will find 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.000
 also some useful things because some 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.340
 ask for microphones so you can yes 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.049
 have a look over 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.940
 MTV is in there the intro manufacturer 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.040
 So if anyone stops by 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.049
 always an infobox already on facebook 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.090
 We are not easier to guide 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.100
 but we only want you always 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.959
 be up to date because there 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.280
 we can post something quickly as on 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.630
 youtube video upload 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.489
 because maybe we too 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.320
 sometimes totally escalations or something to try 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.030
 we always wanted to and post this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.620
 if we still need people and then 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.940
 would have to be fast because sometimes 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.079
 we have our eight people quickly 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.910
 maybe together you have 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.570
 luck 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.130
 that sounds a bit now 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.829
 arrogant at but yes and eight people with 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.480
 8 no matter that does not matter now i would 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.209
 Say goodbye today 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.880
 first time not for the first time 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.590
 first actually to room pascal would 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.810
 I tell the Rhine to the skin 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.370
 next time jesse yes i design now 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.900

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.900
 and then go in until next time
