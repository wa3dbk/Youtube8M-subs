00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello today I will teach you how to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 prepares a meal from the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.759
 urticaria which is a poisonous plant 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.199
 normally people do not want to touch it 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.009
 directly and thinks that's why it's not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.919
 edible but let's today learn from 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.030
 how to collect how to select the 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.120
 collective parts with groceries and how 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.080
 prepare a rich stew that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 later we will see already in the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.350
 dish as it looks and is and in their little houses 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.810
 if they repeat it good they will be able to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 savor the also for what we are 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.760
 realizing we are going to need a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.220
 take a pair of scissors and if they are fixed in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.240
 I have a cover on my right hand 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.000
 rubber glove simply so that the 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.100
 plant do not burn me at the time of 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 connect it here in the corner of my micro 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.120
 Orchard can see that there is a small 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.230
 forest cited of multicast that we are going to 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.230
 collect today we are going 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.009
 if they fix the plant has a stem 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.590
 quite 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.140
 pretty hard and the edible part 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.560
 Of course, it is not the stem but the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.810
 little leaves then what are we going to proceed 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:49.689
 we are going to cut only the leaves and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.630
 place them in our container and a 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.539
 bit 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.060
 if we were going to cut only the 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.090
 the leaves that are what we 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.830
 they are interested to eat 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.409
 in such a way that it is more inside him 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.710
 from the dish 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.900
 leaf like this one that is a little bit 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.910
 if we can see what was a little 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.620
 damaged is a little bit stained and is 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.710
 then this is not going to collect the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.710
 let's leave for your composting 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.260
 all these leaves are edible not 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.300
 because the trunk would not be edible 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.550
 but because it's a little bit I help you 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.600
 bit hard and hard d 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.600
 cooking 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 of groceries and it's edible true 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.590
 but this would be more difficult 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.910
 to prepare it to cook it so that 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.470
 really be smooth and nice 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.520
 of this plant 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.220
 we take advantage of the parties 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.210
 all the parts and you are the bunches 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.850
 new ones are very rich 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:10.170
 it's good not to touch them because you can 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.240
 which seas contains formic acid which is 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.240
 the same has been that they use the 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.450
 ants to attack their their 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.660
 enemies but already cooked 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.220
 with onions and garlic as we shall see go 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.790
 to see that it is not for nothing 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.950
 not at all with dreams or and it's very rich 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.770
 then this part of the plant and now 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.470
 let's leave in a little pile to 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.560
 later composting is rich in 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.670
 match and add 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.990
 to compost this precious element 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.300
 then now let's cut out the video 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.750
 so as not to waste so much time and see you 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.970
 a little while in the kitchen to see how 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.010
 let's manipulate the leaves and how we 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.180
 we prepare 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.299
 first we put the leaves in a pot 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.090
 and we went through the boil 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:11.269
 then we cut onion garlic the fry 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.510
 slightly until browned in oil and 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.000
 once the leaves of the nettle 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.530
 they went through the boil then what 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.840
 we extract them we separate them from the broth 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.020
 resulting we filter them and then what 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.139
 we cut finely with a knife and what 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.289
 add to the onion and garlic that we have 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:37.970
 previously re- fried in the oil 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:40.910
 olive tree and we reflect it about 5 or 10 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.919
 minutes and you're ready to be served 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.810
 for example in this case we serve it with 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.810
 black beans and brown rice
