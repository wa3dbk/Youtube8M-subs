00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.910
 still at school 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.310

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.310
 here 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.670
 to try 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.650

 reiterating its position in the field that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.240
 it was the left exterior one where

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.730

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.110
 what to say 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.580
 the Bohemian technician didn't expect anything else 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.540
 from this purchase campaign 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.540
