a nice soft carpet so okay so let me
show<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.520> inputs<00:01:37.880> first<00:01:38.889> let<00:01:39.889> me<00:01:40.009> zoom<00:01:40.189> in

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
show you the inputs first let me zoom in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.039 
show you the inputs first let me zoom in
a<00:01:40.459> little<00:01:40.579> bit<00:01:42.520> okay<00:01:43.520> okay<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:44.509> this

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
a little bit okay okay so this

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.919 
a little bit okay okay so this
particular<00:01:45.350> one<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.359> this<00:01:47.359> particular

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
particular one the this particular

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.590 
particular one the this particular
series<00:01:48.369> it's<00:01:49.369> lighter<00:01:49.609> weights<00:01:49.969> made<00:01:50.299> out<00:01:50.450> of

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
series it's lighter weights made out of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.029 
series it's lighter weights made out of
a<00:01:50.689> lighter<00:01:50.899> material<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:54.020> has<00:01:54.259> different

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
a lighter material and it has different

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.669 
a lighter material and it has different
inputs<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:55.819> can<00:01:55.850> actually<00:01:56.149> do<00:01:56.359> rca's<00:01:56.899> so

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
inputs you can actually do rca's so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.039 
inputs you can actually do rca's so
right<00:01:57.889> from<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.130> CD<00:01:58.369> player<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:59.600> have<00:01:59.630> the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
right from a CD player you have the

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.349 
right from a CD player you have the
quarter-inch

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
quarter-inch

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.819 
quarter-inch
inputs<00:02:02.359> you<00:02:02.959> also<00:02:03.109> have<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:05.109> speak<00:02:06.109> on<00:02:06.349> which

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
inputs you also have the speak on which

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.520 
inputs you also have the speak on which
I'll<00:02:07.009> show<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.219> what<00:02:07.369> those<00:02:07.520> look<00:02:07.579> like<00:02:07.819> and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
I'll show you what those look like and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.060 
I'll show you what those look like and
XOR<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.480> has<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> built<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.230> crossover

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
XOR so and this has a built in crossover

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.850 
XOR so and this has a built in crossover
so<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.910> send<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
so you can send this to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.500 
so you can send this to
or<00:02:16.980> your<00:02:17.370> subs<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:19.500> got<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:21.240> roll-off

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
or your subs it's got the the roll-off

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.900 
or your subs it's got the the roll-off
your<00:02:22.140> high<00:02:22.560> frequency<00:02:23.130> your<00:02:23.280> low<00:02:23.400> frequency

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
your high frequency your low frequency

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.480 
your high frequency your low frequency
