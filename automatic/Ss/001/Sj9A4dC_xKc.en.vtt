 let's double- click on it and we'll 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.780
 wait for him to open his menu and well we 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.540
 let's place us where says January 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.190
 cover of signar let's give it 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.310
 on the arrow to display the menu 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.010
 well here he tells us that January cover 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.070
 signar helps us create covers and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.200
 custom cd and dvd labels with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.660
 scanner images a digital camera 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.910
 an internet and well we are going to 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.630
 give it on the bottom on the button 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:30.960
 initial and we'll wait until January 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.960
 good start here will ask us 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.990
 the kind of deciding whether it's standard or a 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.390
 dvd box and well we are going to 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.480
 give it in standard and in empty document and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.930
 let's give it to accept 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.930
 well here the cover does not come out 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.710
 and well we are going to act 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.800
 on the disc one as you see here already 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.490
 has the prototype of the cid and the sizes 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.820
 exact and it would only be a matter of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:11.280
 matter and well we are inside the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.490
 the prototype of the cid and with the measures 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.720
 already accurate will only be a matter of 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.240
 add the image that we made 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.870
 with the string draw so we're going to 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.370
 place us on the object and let's 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.299
 to give him to introduce 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.299
 image 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.150

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.250
 sold in bookstores this paper has 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.430
 a special glue and once you 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.580
 print the label on this paper and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.030
 they can not take it off like that 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.830
 make sure to do it with care and 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.450
