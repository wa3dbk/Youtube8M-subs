on the other cave in the snow patch I

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.390 
on the other cave in the snow patch I
spray<00:05:44.700> drying<00:05:44.850> out<00:05:44.970> again

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.350 

replenishing<00:05:50.400> your<00:05:50.430> spray<00:05:50.790> does<00:05:51.000> get<00:05:51.150> kind<00:05:51.330> of

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
replenishing your spray does get kind of

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.060 
replenishing your spray does get kind of
annoying<00:05:51.480> but<00:05:51.870> it<00:05:51.960> takes<00:05:52.140> much<00:05:52.530> less<00:05:52.800> time

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
annoying but it takes much less time

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.350 
annoying but it takes much less time

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
than having to run away from every

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.360 
than having to run away from every
single<00:05:54.660> battle<00:05:54.960> or<00:05:55.110> killing<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:55.920> Pokemon<00:05:56.250> if

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
single battle or killing the Pokemon if

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.810 
single battle or killing the Pokemon if

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
you do feel so inclined but later on the

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.070 
you do feel so inclined but later on the
game<00:06:00.000> when<00:06:00.120> your<00:06:00.210> Pokemon<00:06:00.540> don't<00:06:00.690> really<00:06:00.930> need
