00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.100
 gene heron for the body of champions 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.379
 I want to clarify a doubt that normally 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.300
 people are asking me through 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.639
 my videos from my youtube channel body 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.570
 of champions and one of the big doubts 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 is should I take the protein in serum 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.039
 of protein powder when I owe it to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.640
 take it I must drink starting the day 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.769
 I must take finishing training when 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.230
 is the right time to take the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.920
 protein here goes the answer the secret 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.340
 millennial there is no ideal moment 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.079
 to take your protein powder while 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 you meet your protein goal 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 daily that is to say the grams of protein to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.430
 daily according to your goal either 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.309
 to increase muscle mass or to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.890
 lose fat either of the two 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.050
 objectives that you have while you arrive 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.590
 to your daily protein is to say to your 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 daily macronutrients will not cause 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.359
 exactly no difference if you take 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.769
 your powder in the night of proteins and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.229
 you take your powder after entering 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.070
 if you take your powder in the morning not 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.320
 there is a difference in that either is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.079
 that's a myth that people say that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.509
 finishing training is when you should 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.140
 from taking 2 scott of protein to one of 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.079
 protein people have a problem 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.179
 sickly with the protein care and eye 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.700
 with the protein that also the excesses 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.939
 of proteins are stored as fat there 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.539
 than to know how much protein is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.030
 needs according to your needs and 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.349
 either to lose fat or increase 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 muscle as I told you right now 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:47.039
 then forget about saying term 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.259
 train and I have to take this one 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.420
 liquefied protein or in the morning I have 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.329
 that liquefied a protein shake take 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.700
 before training do not wake up I have 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.180
 my protein voice I have my boat of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 protein and the truth is that 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.020
 I have almost two weeks that I do not take my 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.360
 disc and I do not take it because I do not need it 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.300
 right now I mean I use the studies 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.690
 proteins for when for when you have 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.940
 what to leave 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.060
 and do not have time to eat do not have 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.270
 time to cook some meat chicken 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.910
 or protein things that I like 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.920
 clear mentions with fast protein and what 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.180
 consumption and so I would have reached my most 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.650
 recent of the day then that's my 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.080
 advice for you 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.290
 forget and take away that obsession for 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.220
 protein how many proteins do you need 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.690
 around two kilograms 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.340
 by lean body weight ok then 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.680
 I hope this advice has served you 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.870
