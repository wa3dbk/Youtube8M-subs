that means that in zombie mode there's
either<00:02:23.730> gonna<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.120> weapon<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.690> new

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.750 
grenade which is an EMP grenade which
you<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.190> pacify<00:02:29.190> I'm<00:02:29.400> not<00:02:29.520> sure<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
you have to pacify I'm not sure if that

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.180 
you have to pacify I'm not sure if that
means<00:02:30.000> killed<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:31.350> temporarily<00:02:31.860> shut

what<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.810> means<00:02:34.050> I'm<00:02:34.440> hoping<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.190> means<00:02:35.370> kill

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
what that means I'm hoping it means kill

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.490 
what that means I'm hoping it means kill
if<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.239> would<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.510> melt<00:02:36.810> their<00:02:36.989> brains<00:02:37.020> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
if it would like melt their brains and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.809 
if it would like melt their brains and
their<00:02:37.590> heads<00:02:37.739> would<00:02:37.950> explode<00:02:37.980> something<00:02:38.670> like

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
their heads would explode something like

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.030 
their heads would explode something like
that<00:02:39.000> with<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.750> EMP<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.709> be<00:02:40.860> very

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
that with one EMP that would be very

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.339 
that with one EMP that would be very
cool<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.550> see<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.450> was<00:02:42.630> actually<00:02:43.050> real<00:02:43.230> or

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
cool to see if that was actually real or

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.449 
cool to see if that was actually real or
fake<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.620> hope<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:43.920> real<00:02:44.069> because<00:02:44.160> I'd<00:02:44.370> be

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
fake I hope it's real because I'd be

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.680 
fake I hope it's real because I'd be
cool<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.760> zombies<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> be<00:02:45.269> able<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> throw<00:02:45.630> an

activision<00:03:49.739> has<00:03:49.769> has<00:03:50.370> made<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:51.150> solid<00:03:52.049> effort

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
activision has has made a solid effort

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.849 
activision has has made a solid effort
to<00:03:52.829> keep<00:03:53.010> them<00:03:53.250> hidden<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:55.260> i<00:03:55.530> don't<00:03:55.739> know

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
to keep them hidden and so i don't know

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.259 
to keep them hidden and so i don't know
if<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:55.980> makes<00:03:56.250> them<00:03:56.549> real<00:03:56.790> or<00:03:56.940> not<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.239> just

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
if that makes them real or not it just

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.640 
if that makes them real or not it just
means<00:03:57.569> activision<00:03:58.079> doesn't<00:03:58.290> want<00:03:58.410> people

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
means activision doesn't want people

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.750 
means activision doesn't want people
having<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.130> information<00:03:59.310> out<00:03:59.700> there

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
having this information out there

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.800 
having this information out there
because<00:04:00.120> they<00:04:00.209> don't<00:04:00.329> want<00:04:00.480> people<00:04:00.510> getting

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
because they don't want people getting

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.930 
because they don't want people getting
the<00:04:01.049> wrong<00:04:01.079> idea<00:04:01.410> or<00:04:02.220> maybe<00:04:02.400> they<00:04:02.609> don't<00:04:02.670> want

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
the wrong idea or maybe they don't want

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.630 
the wrong idea or maybe they don't want
people<00:04:02.970> getting<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.750> right<00:04:03.870> idea<00:04:04.380> but<00:04:04.640> i

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
people getting the right idea but i

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.580 
people getting the right idea but i
guess<00:04:06.090> we<00:04:06.359> will<00:04:06.540> all<00:04:06.720> find<00:04:07.049> out<00:04:07.260> soon<00:04:07.500> enough
