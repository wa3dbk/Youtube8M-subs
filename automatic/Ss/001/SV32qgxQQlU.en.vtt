the<00:02:19.220> lightning<00:02:19.670> bolt<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.390> soon<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:21.080> possible

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the lightning bolt as soon as possible

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.420 
the lightning bolt as soon as possible
because<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:23.000> does<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.209> lot<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.569> damage<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.200> me

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
because it does a lot of damage to me

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.979 
because it does a lot of damage to me
