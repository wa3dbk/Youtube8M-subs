the<00:00:10.230> Saturn<00:00:10.559> system<00:00:10.880> it's<00:00:11.880> got<00:00:12.630> these

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the Saturn system it's got these

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.810 
the Saturn system it's got these

there's<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> source<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.090> water<00:00:42.300> down<00:00:42.600> there

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
there's a source of water down there

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.889 
there's a source of water down there
it's<00:00:43.140> coming<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.620> everywhere<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.480> big<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it's coming out everywhere so how big it

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.319 
it's coming out everywhere so how big it
is<00:00:45.989> how<00:00:46.050> extensive<00:00:47.010> people<00:00:47.460> don't<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:48.030> for

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is how extensive people don't know for

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
is how extensive people don't know for
sure<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.230> colder<00:00:49.920> we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
sure because it's so much colder we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.770 
sure because it's so much colder we
don't<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> liquid<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.270> coming<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
don't get liquid water coming out of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.439 
don't get liquid water coming out of
those<00:00:51.989> guys<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.100> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:54.239> fine

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
those guys as we get a lot of very fine

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
those guys as we get a lot of very fine
ice<00:00:54.660> particles<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.289> lot<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> vapor<00:00:56.149> for<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
ice particles a lot of vapor for this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
ice particles a lot of vapor for this
flyby<00:00:57.719> we're<00:00:58.050> coming<00:00:58.350> down<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> north

flyby we're coming down from the north

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.700 
flyby we're coming down from the north
going<00:00:59.579> past<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> equator<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:00.989> under

around<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.489> earth<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.689> three

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
around the earth is there about three

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.230 
around the earth is there about three
hundred<00:01:06.930> kilometers<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:08.189> we're<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> be

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
hundred kilometers up we're going to be

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.380 
hundred kilometers up we're going to be
about<00:01:09.510> six<00:01:09.780> times<00:01:10.020> closer<00:01:10.860> than<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
about six times closer than that the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
about six times closer than that the
closest<00:01:12.810> approach<00:01:12.900> point<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.189> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
closest approach point is just a little

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
closest approach point is just a little
below<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> equator<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.740> get

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
below the equator but by the time we get

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
below the equator but by the time we get
down<00:01:17.189> near<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> South<00:01:17.909> Pole<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
down near the South Pole where the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
down near the South Pole where the
plumes<00:01:18.869> are<00:01:19.170> we're<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.159> more

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
plumes are we're going to be up more

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
plumes are we're going to be up more
like<00:01:20.580> 200<00:01:21.060> kilometers<00:01:21.570> altitude<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like 200 kilometers altitude we just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
like 200 kilometers altitude we just
sort<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.979> grazed<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.580> edge<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> plume

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sort of grazed the edge of the plume

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.679 
sort of grazed the edge of the plume
last<00:01:24.570> time<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.850> 2005<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> time<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:27.420> really

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689

made<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.259> instruments<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.939> certainly

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
made by the instruments will certainly

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.920

lead<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.850> understanding<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> interior<00:01:36.540> how

lead to understanding the interior how

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.289 
lead to understanding the interior how
