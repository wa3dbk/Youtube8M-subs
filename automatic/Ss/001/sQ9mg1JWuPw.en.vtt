00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.480
 Panic episode at the palace party 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.730
 we can see that the sweet princess 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.190
 try to revive a sweet inhabitant who 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.860
 he had died in the cafe his name was the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.710
 creamy sir we can see that the sweet 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 princess laughs and says they used to walk 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.650
 together it is nothing less than the groom 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.960
 of the sweet princess we can see this 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.990
 in the chapter the vault where the sweet 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.720
 Princess presents him to choco life 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 Last end it's about the same man 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 creamy let's see for a moment 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.860
 the man that we spent together 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.720
 an obvious data but it should be 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.540
 mentioned is that the favorite color of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.760
 the sweet princess is the pink we can 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.280
 check it because in the chapter the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.650
 true end gives you a model to 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.740
 scale of the sweet kingdom but the sweet 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.860
 princess sneezes only the tray is left 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.830
 pink the princess is happy and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.970
 tells him that pink is his favorite 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.970
 let's see for a moment 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.180
 or what 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:23.210
 this end I did not do something like this I can 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.210
 see them and live from their select eyes 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.280
 can already open it 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.280
 we do not close for about three hours 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.770
 my eyes 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.489
 Thank you 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.769
 one thing we can notice about the sweet 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.870
 princess is that apparently she is 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.450
 obsessed with immortality as 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.970
 we can see it in the goliat chapter in 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.010
 this chapter the sweet princess says that 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.610
 he will not live forever that he would 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.640
 I could but if she has already lived 827 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.280
 years and it barely looks like it has 19 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.859
 She can easily live several years 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.900
 thousands of years more I think this is 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.500
 some kind of immortality after 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.670
 all 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.670
 let's see for a moment 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.010
 as princess of the sweet kingdom I am 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.430
 charge of a lot of sweet people 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.569
 they trust me I can not imagine 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.019
 what would happen to them if I died 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:34.519
 and after I almost died the hand of 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:37.670
 milk but I realized something I'm not going to 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.180
 to live forever I would end it if 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.180
 I could 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.200
 in the chapter the vault we can see by 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.780
 first time to lie that takes you to a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.760
 little paula the sweet princess for this 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.970
 and more we can assume that the sweets 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.550
 inhabitants live on average more than 300 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.010
 years and if the sweet princess can 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.530
 revive the ones with the serum of is corpse and 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.200
 zador then maybe the sweet people 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.510
 be immortal and this is why the sweet 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.350
 princess seek immortality 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.350
 let's see for a moment 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.840
 for youtube 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.840
 and not 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.180
 in the chapter only foolish magicians we can 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.030
 see that the sweet princess does not believe in the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.880
 magic says that it is science in this case 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.820
 we can see in chapter 5 fables 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.280
 short the sweet princess contradicts 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.590
 because he puts on a witch's hat and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.810
 recite some spell so that the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.950
 yeast become bread 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.950
 let's see for a moment 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.700
 science 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.700
 I do not know if that's why you call it magic and that 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.759
 to the August prison 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.210
 finally I want the first house 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:24.289
 in the chapter only fools magicians game you 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.689
 ask the sweet princess that if not 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.749
 believe in magic then as it explains 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:32.779
 things that can make sweet 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:35.870
 princess finally explains that jake is 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.949
 really a mutant dog instead of a 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.789
 magic dog 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.789
 let's see for a moment 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.680
 Well, that's how it works, although well then 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.639
 I'm this is not magic for you 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.639
 that is a mutation 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.690
 finally I leave you with the best outfit 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.480

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.030
