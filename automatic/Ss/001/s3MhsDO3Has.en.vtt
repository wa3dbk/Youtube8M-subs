 it was time to go to the field and the bunny 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.730
 and grabbed the long ears of the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.730
 father's day 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 he wanted to make sure that the rabbit 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.910
 dad was listening to how much I 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.410
 I love you, he said 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.160
 I think I can not guess this. 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.160
 replied father rabbit 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:48.020
 all this he said with this song 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 arms as much as possible 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.980
 only the father rabbit had the most arms 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.980
 long and said and I love you all this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:10.910
 and they are a bit thought the bunny I you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.910
 I love all my height said bunny 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.280
 and I love you all my height said 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.470
 father's day 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.440
 Pull this up! 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 thought bunny I wanted to have arms 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.940
 so long then the bunny had 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.479
 a good idea 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.100
 he turned his head in support of the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.220
 tree limbs 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:47.040
 I love you right up to the tips of your fingers. 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.509
 my feet and I love you to the ends of the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.580
 fingers of your feet said the rabbit father 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:59.690
 swinging the son in the air I love you 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 height of my leap river bunny 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.560
 jumping up and down 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.930
 and I had a time of my jumping river 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.760
 also the father rabbit and high salton that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.620
 your ears touch the branches of 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.160
 trees and that wants to jump thought 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.490
 well I'd like to jump 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.490
 like this 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.330
 I love you all the way from here to the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.580
 River 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:46.940
 shouted the bunny I love you until after 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.940
 from the river to the hills said the father rabbit 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.300
 It's a pretty distance thought the bunny 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.319
 he was too sleepy to 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.200
 keep thinking then he looked at 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.880
 beyond the treetops to immense 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.850
 night darkness 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.850
 nothing could be greater than the sky 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:26.890
 I love you until the moon, " he said. 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:32.320
 and closed the eyes pulls this is far 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.320
 said the rabbit father really far 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.710
 the rabbit father laid the bunny in his 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.240
 walks with leaves and then bows 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.240
 to kiss you good night 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.209
 then lay down next to her son and 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.380
 whispered smiling I love you until the moon 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.380
 round trip
