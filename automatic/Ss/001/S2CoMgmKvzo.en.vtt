00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello how about everyone this time 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.029
 I bring the criticism to the most recent 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 movie that I saw and I mean hotel 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.460
 transylvania ok with nothing more to say 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.139
 let's start the story tells us that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.719
 drÃ¡cula built a hotel so that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.020
 all monsters such as man 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.900
 Wolf 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 frank stein mummy and so could 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 rest but above all they could 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.170
 take refuge from humans but also 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.019
 Dracula has his daughter whose name is not 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.269
 I remember x that he just turned 118 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.219
 years which is like any typical 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.170
 rebellious teenager who wants to meet 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.059
 humans but dracula does not want that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.250
 I know them because it has a kind of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 trauma with them but the plot starts 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 when a human arrives at the hotel 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.160
 alters the whole movie because 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 dracula tries to cover up what for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 the monsters do not know that he is a human 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 making him go through a relative of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 frank stein for the truth what I most 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.239
 liked the movie was the good idea 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.160
 that they had to gather the most famous 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.829
 monsters in a hotel besides the movie 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 it has a pretty good animation and the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.030
 designs of the characters are good 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.460
 because they are not like the ones we've seen 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 before that's why in my point of view they are 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.340
 pretty good 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.409
 that the plot of the monsters 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 they had to build their own hotel 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 to take refuge this original and the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 they learned to manage quite well well 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 that the film is very white to what 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 I mean it is not rude 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 double meaning et cetera but at my point 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.439
 This is also a defect, 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.030
 the movie is very childish what it does 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.950
 adults can reach 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 bore with her besides the movie 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.149
 at a certain point it is very predictable because 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.039
 at least me from the middle of the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.049
 movie and I imagined what was going to 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.090
 also spend the love between the two 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.159
 main characters at my point of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 Vista was very hurried and he was not given 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.539
 enough time to develop 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 in a better way besides another thing that 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.409
 I did not really like how they handled the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.179
 hotel because in no time they show you 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.610
 the different rooms for the 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.619
 different monsters and that's something that in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.289
 Personally, I did not like it very much, but in 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.659
 overall the movie is pretty good ok 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.220
 in conclusion hotel transylvania is a 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.490
 very good movie that the whole family 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.500
 can enjoy and I give a 9.5 out of 10 and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.950
 this criticism arrives until the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 next
