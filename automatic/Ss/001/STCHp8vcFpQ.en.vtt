00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
a rather nice gig bag but it also comes

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.509 
a rather nice gig bag but it also comes
with<00:02:39.370> an<00:02:39.580> extra<00:02:39.700> saddle<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:42.040> does<00:02:42.280> give

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
with an extra saddle so that does give

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.809 
with an extra saddle so that does give
you<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.670> ability<00:02:42.850> if<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.630> wanted<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.819> lower

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
you the ability if you wanted to lower

the<00:02:45.910> action<00:02:46.420> or<00:02:46.600> anything<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.110> could

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the action or anything like that could

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.710 
the action or anything like that could
take<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.160> guitar<00:02:48.280> tip<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.239> have<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
take it to a guitar tip and you have the

take it to a guitar tip and you have the

actual replacement to saddle for for
that<00:02:54.850> kind<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.209> work<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.650> body<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.220> bound

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
that kind of work now the body is bound

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.110 
that kind of work now the body is bound
front<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.319> back<00:02:59.500> with<00:02:59.799> a<00:02:59.830> black<00:03:00.190> binding

which<00:03:01.450> gives<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.019> nice<00:03:02.260> little<00:03:02.530> definition

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
which gives it a nice little definition

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.970 
which gives it a nice little definition
about<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.750> sort<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.049> just<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.440> quick<00:03:05.620> listen

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980

the<00:04:50.640> surrounding<00:04:51.030> pickup<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.600> little

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
the surrounding pickup is a little

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.500 
the surrounding pickup is a little
little<00:04:52.830> bit<00:04:53.070> on<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.280> strident<00:04:53.580> side<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.300> what

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
little bit on the strident side so what

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.070 
little bit on the strident side so what
I<00:04:54.540> found<00:04:55.020> was<00:04:55.440> quite<00:04:55.740> useful<00:04:56.060> was<00:04:57.060> taking<00:04:57.870> out

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
I found was quite useful was taking out

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.100 
I found was quite useful was taking out
a<00:04:58.590> little<00:04:59.460> bit<00:04:59.730> of<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.910> travel<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:01.910> little

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
a little bit of the travel a little

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:22.880 
a little bit of the travel a little
maybe<00:05:05.420> boosting<00:05:06.420> a<00:05:06.480> little<00:05:06.660> bit<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.960> face

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.860 

don't<00:05:23.460> immediately<00:05:23.610> warms<00:05:24.120> up<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.360> sound<00:05:24.600> and

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
don't immediately warms up the sound and

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.660 
don't immediately warms up the sound and
there's<00:05:25.080> still<00:05:25.290> plenty<00:05:25.590> of<00:05:25.950> play<00:05:26.250> in<00:05:26.490> these

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
there's still plenty of play in these

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.080 
there's still plenty of play in these
sliders<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:27.930> I've<00:05:28.860> set<00:05:29.220> my<00:05:29.370> amplifier<00:05:29.670> up

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
sliders but I've set my amplifier up

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.430 
sliders but I've set my amplifier up
flat<00:05:30.390> as<00:05:31.290> far<00:05:31.530> as<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.740> EQ<00:05:32.040> is<00:05:32.160> concerned<00:05:32.640> so

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
flat as far as the EQ is concerned so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.980 
flat as far as the EQ is concerned so
the<00:05:34.820> amplifier<00:05:35.820> is<00:05:36.060> not<00:05:36.300> adding<00:05:36.570> anything<00:05:36.810> to

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
the amplifier is not adding anything to

the amplifier is not adding anything to

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
the sound part from Mildura rainbow so

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.380 
the sound part from Mildura rainbow so

the sound of the guitar where the little

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.590 
the sound of the guitar where the little
bit<00:05:45.540> of<00:05:45.630> tweak<00:05:45.840> on<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.290> cue<00:05:46.970> comes<00:05:47.970> out<00:05:48.210> nice

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
bit of tweak on the cue comes out nice

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.680 
bit of tweak on the cue comes out nice

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.810 

you're<00:05:53.200> still<00:05:53.410> going<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.680> travel<00:05:54.010> top<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:54.580> if

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
you're still going to travel top and if

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.020 
you're still going to travel top and if

it's<00:06:01.030> going<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.419> give<00:06:01.539> you<00:06:01.660> more<00:06:01.840> cut<00:06:02.199> when

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
it's going to give you more cut when

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.379 
it's going to give you more cut when
you're<00:06:02.590> playing<00:06:02.860> with<00:06:03.039> other<00:06:03.160> instruments<00:06:03.820> so
