00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.400 
timing that was like yeah and I
that<00:02:28.020> one<00:02:28.230> up<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.900> need<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> get<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that one up so you need to get the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.010 
that one up so you need to get the
timing<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> speed<00:02:33.000> right<00:02:33.450> see<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
timing and the speed right see the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.750 
timing and the speed right see the
timing<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.500> off<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.070> think<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.340> did<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.580> too

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
timing was off then I think I did it too

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.750 
timing was off then I think I did it too
late<00:02:36.030> add<00:02:36.450> too<00:02:36.630> early<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.020> mean<00:02:41.870> okay<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.310> all

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
late add too early I mean okay so all

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.580 
late add too early I mean okay so all
you<00:02:45.450> need<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.600> do<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.020> practice<00:02:46.230> with

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you need to do is just practice with

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.020 
you need to do is just practice with
those<00:02:46.740> controls<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.640> all<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:47.970> guys

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
those controls I think all you guys

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.000 
those controls I think all you guys
really<00:02:48.450> need<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.959> needle<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.560> know<00:02:49.709> was<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
really need to needle to know was the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.280 
really need to needle to know was the
controls<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.990> go<00:02:52.140> off<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
controls and then you can go off and

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.220 
controls and then you can go off and
practice<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:52.860> later<00:02:53.690> well<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:55.080> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
practice that later well you can go and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.850 
practice that later well you can go and
practice<00:02:55.620> at<00:02:55.800> yourselves<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:58.170> Xbox<00:02:58.650> is

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
food for both of them it's boost and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.990 
food for both of them it's boost and
Xbox<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.290> Lt

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
as i said you need to get the timing and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.730 
as i said you need to get the timing and
the<00:03:20.560> speed<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.130> DoubleTap<00:03:21.520> tnx<00:03:22.000> as<00:03:22.740> like

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
the speed of you DoubleTap tnx as like

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.100 
the speed of you DoubleTap tnx as like
pretty<00:03:24.010> well<00:03:24.190> spot<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:24.780> otherwise<00:03:25.780> you're

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
pretty well spot on otherwise you're

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.080 
pretty well spot on otherwise you're
just<00:03:26.140> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.650> do<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:27.130> layup<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:30.090> so

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
just going to do a layup like that so

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
just going to do a layup like that so
I'm<00:03:31.360> still<00:03:31.600> working<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.020> out<00:03:32.110> but<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.530> had<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:32.980> got

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
I'm still working it out but I had I got

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.949 
I'm still working it out but I had I got
the<00:03:33.280> hang<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.330> thought<00:03:34.510> I'd<00:03:34.660> quickly

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
the hang of it so I thought I'd quickly

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.130 
the hang of it so I thought I'd quickly
do<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.200> while<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.410> had<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:35.950> hang<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:38.080> now

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
do it while I had the hang of it and now

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.430 
do it while I had the hang of it and now
as<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.400> see<00:03:39.459> i'm<00:03:39.760> failing<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.750> get<00:03:41.290> rid<00:03:41.350> of

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
as you can see i'm failing so get rid of

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.230 
as you can see i'm failing so get rid of
that<00:03:41.590> possible<00:03:42.100> got<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.520> one

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.090 

so<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.260> need<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.500> get<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> angle<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
so you need to get the angle and the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
so you need to get the angle and the
speed<00:03:53.100> or<00:03:53.310> right<00:03:53.630> otherwise<00:03:54.630> you're<00:03:55.110> just

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
speed or right otherwise you're just

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.630 
speed or right otherwise you're just
going<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.620> do<00:03:55.740> a<00:03:55.770> layup<00:03:56.870> but<00:03:57.870> when<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> do<00:03:58.320> it

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
going to do a layup but when you do it

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.940 
going to do a layup but when you do it
it's<00:03:59.640> pretty<00:04:00.030> rewarding<00:04:00.330> because<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.530> a

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
it's pretty rewarding because this is a

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.650 
it's pretty rewarding because this is a
pain<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:02.970> arse<00:04:03.210> of<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.480> dunk<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.930> do<00:04:04.820> as<00:04:05.820> this

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
pain in the arse of a dunk to do as this

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.360
