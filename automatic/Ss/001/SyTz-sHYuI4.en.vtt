00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
other words if I created that first or

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.359 
other words if I created that first or
applied<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.720> first<00:01:55.020> preset<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.770> then

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
applied that first preset and then

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.480 
applied that first preset and then
exported<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.479> DNG<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.619> could<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
exported it as a DNG I could go in and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
exported it as a DNG I could go in and
mess<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.909> those<00:02:00.350> settings<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.770> preset

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.470 
pixels per inch output sharpening this
isn't<00:02:28.739> really<00:02:28.980> necessary<00:02:29.159> but<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.239> leave

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
isn't really necessary but I just leave

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.100 
isn't really necessary but I just leave
that<00:02:30.660> alone<00:02:31.190> metadata<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.810> right

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that alone metadata I have right

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.880 
that alone metadata I have right
keywords<00:02:34.560> as<00:02:34.769> Lightroom<00:02:35.190> hierarchy<00:02:35.849> selected

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
keywords as Lightroom hierarchy selected

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.250 
keywords as Lightroom hierarchy selected
again<00:02:37.890> these<00:02:38.099> down<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.930> basically<00:02:39.930> just

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
again these down here are basically just

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.130 
again these down here are basically just
up<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.060> post-processing<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.659> don't<00:02:42.900> want

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
up to you post-processing I don't want

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.880 
up to you post-processing I don't want
it<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.379> do<00:02:43.560> anything<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:46.019> know<00:02:46.110> remember<00:02:46.739> like

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it to do anything you know remember like

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.319 
it to do anything you know remember like
going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> photoshop<00:02:47.790> or<00:02:47.970> something<00:02:48.269> like

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
going to photoshop or something like

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.020 
going to photoshop or something like
that<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.890> pretty<00:02:49.890> simple<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.430> mean<00:02:50.579> there's<00:02:50.790> not

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that so pretty simple I mean there's not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.690 
that so pretty simple I mean there's not
many<00:02:51.560> settings<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.739> basically<00:02:53.160> your<00:02:53.430> file

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
many settings there basically your file

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.000 
many settings there basically your file
settings<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.390> your<00:02:54.480> export<00:02:54.989> location<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.769> is

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
settings and your export location is is

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.099 
settings and your export location is is
the<00:02:56.310> two<00:02:56.519> biggies<00:02:56.819> right<00:02:57.209> here<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.750> then<00:02:57.930> we'll

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
the two biggies right here so then we'll

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.330 
the two biggies right here so then we'll
just<00:02:58.319> hit<00:02:58.500> export<00:02:59.239> I<00:03:00.239> already<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.340> so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340

just hit export I already have one so
I'm<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.670> overwrite<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.390> one<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.170> just

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

it's the same thing here but we have all

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.550 
it's the same thing here but we have all
zeros<00:03:36.540> again<00:03:36.840> remember<00:03:37.230> from<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.530> last

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
zeros again remember from the last

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.670 
zeros again remember from the last
tutorial<00:03:38.209> here's<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.540> original<00:03:39.680> preset

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
tutorial here's the original preset

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.759 
tutorial here's the original preset
settings<00:03:41.150> here's<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.299> zero<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.230> then<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.590> we

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
settings here's a zero so then if we

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.159 
settings here's a zero so then if we
just<00:03:43.950> go<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.190> here<00:03:44.669> back<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> old-skool

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
just go over here back to the old-skool

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.640 
just go over here back to the old-skool
toning<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.099> kedah<00:03:47.989> right<00:03:48.989> there<00:03:49.230> just

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
toning and kedah right there just

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.059 
toning and kedah right there just
layered<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.959> presets<00:03:51.959> on<00:03:52.349> top<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.769> each<00:03:52.889> other

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
layered to presets on top of each other

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.569 
layered to presets on top of each other
and<00:03:53.459> we<00:03:53.790> never<00:03:54.239> even<00:03:54.450> left<00:03:54.630> lightroom<00:03:55.620> much

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and we never even left lightroom much

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.050 
and we never even left lightroom much
easier<00:03:57.480> see<00:03:58.230> if<00:03:58.379> we<00:03:58.980> would<00:03:59.099> add<00:03:59.250> stack<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.879> two

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
easier see if we would add stack the two

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.759 
easier see if we would add stack the two
on<00:04:00.329> top<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.750> each<00:04:00.840> other<00:04:00.989> without<00:04:01.200> doing<00:04:01.739> that

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
on top of each other without doing that

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.539 
on top of each other without doing that
this<00:04:02.669> is<00:04:02.879> the<00:04:03.000> image<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.359> would<00:04:03.480> have<00:04:03.599> gotten

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
this is the image you would have gotten

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.580 
this is the image you would have gotten
instead<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.669> this<00:04:05.849> one<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.299> really<00:04:07.079> like<00:04:07.230> this

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
instead of this one I really like this

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.330 
instead of this one I really like this
one<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:08.629> that's<00:04:09.629> all<00:04:10.079> there<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.769> so<00:04:11.129> if
