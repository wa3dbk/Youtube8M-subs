00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.880
 Regular in fan speed 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.540
 look here is that I do not know if you appreciate 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.820
 ok well here you already mark it you see that 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.160
 they put like three speeds and there's a 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.520
 switch that is very tiny that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.500
 you can not see and well you can control it 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.270
 and well you put it at the speed that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.540
 you want the speed 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:47.200

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:04.510
 not easy instruction manual 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.239
 then over here to see we have 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.239
 what remains to see the radiator 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.459
 let's see if I can find out why 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.170
 I'm sorry I had to cut a 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.439
 moment of the video I had to leave a 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.489
 good time and have already taken the radiator 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:27.960
 and the pump we are going to take it out without 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.220
 carefully from the cover to see 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.750
 one thing over here 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.270

 133 princess here we have it and good 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.410
 this is a little bit is very big what 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.690
 I imagined more tiny because 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.750
 the light is good also think 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.230
 lights blue brand have more than 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.230
 puts the brand 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.460
 to see if he focuses this camera to see 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.580
 OK 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.690
 and the radiator 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.850

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.709
 then you will see it on 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.230
 you can see the noise that does not know if 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.690
 it makes a lot of noise the truth I did not see it 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.710
 occasion to listen to it so good you 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.260
 I'll leave right now next in case 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.060
