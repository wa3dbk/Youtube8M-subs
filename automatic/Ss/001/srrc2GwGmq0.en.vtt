00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.940
 hello everyone this is the twentieth issue of 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.130
 to you from online in which I will tell you how 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.869
 learn in the barum bath if in your 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.380
 the city has not asked parks and and build there 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.230
 something lazy 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.289
 but you want to make a bar for the spokes of a bathhouse 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.090
 release specifically for you to go top 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.600
 to learning you should be able to pony well 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.040
 hop from about 70 centimeters and how 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.070
 minimum we must have all the basic 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.309
 tricks if you know all this you are ready 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.290
 then let's get started first thing 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.019
 figure out which way and how 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.540
 turn the steering wheel if you are the left leg leading 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.760
 beach tours to the left 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.370
 press the rear wheel against the wall and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.800
 practice rotation note 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.989
 that the steering wheel you have to twist with one hand 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.870
 as soon as you start to spin the steering wheel 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.850
 with your left hand, let your right hand go right away 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.519
 from the wheel lower a little bit down and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.000
 get ready to catch her steering wheel at first 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.040
 stages 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.740
 I recommend fully steering 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.830
 so you will have more control and less 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.410
 fears once disassembled with hands 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.530
 go to the hardest to feet and 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.060
 look at your body 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 sock pull 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.240
 we press close to the connecting rod and touch 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.880
 saddles 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.580
 second leg just fix the force 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.040
 the other side naturally the fatter 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.260
 saddle than it is higher it will be easier 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.730
 it is easier to learn to hold it 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.440
 but that doesn't mean with the lowered 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.110
 aiming the house is impossible to make a bar 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.790
 back any season you can hold yes 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.400
 in general, you can even do without a saddle 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.850
 the main thing is for the leading leg toe to pull 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.330
 myself 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.950
 press it well and keep your legs together 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.620
 still need to take the bike out a bit 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.410
 forward with the whole thing you need to keep 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.860
 exactly in the center so if it is shifted 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.580
 backwards 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.740
 you will fly out from under you and so 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.180
 if you got your hands on understood 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.400
 which side how to turn the steering wheel 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.229
 sorted out legs understand how to clamp 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120
 saddle like a driver 100 forward when 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.550
 same be distributed body weight then 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.220
 go to the main secret bar spin it 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.220
 and learning first she would we all without 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.260
 Pink bunny taught leopard wheels to teach 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.390
 just try on the grass 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.310
 so as not to scratch the bike at first 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.620
 stages do just bani-hop 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.840
 feel how you clamp the saddle like 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.370
 he is in antivirus 5 forward there is nothing 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.090
 scary is that if you fight when 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.830
 panic a little shift back now you 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 you need to understand at what point a bannik 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.270
 you need to turn the steering wheel here the main thing is not 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.940
 hurry spin the steering wheel you should 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.520
 right after you 2 on any 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.290
 forward and clamped the saddle it must 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.750
 happen at about your peak 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.120
 amplitudes if you managed to do everything else 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.120
 on takeoff then spin it well 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.610
 think earlier 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.380
 and control everything you do 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.330
 how do you move the bike forward how 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.370
 clamp the saddle as you spin the steering wheel 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.740
 how to turn it and how to catch it 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.830
 bring all these movements to automatism 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.530
 The advantages of such training in the first you do not 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.480
 scary so try second in essence 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.670
 you do things absolutely the same as 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.190
 and on a bike with wheels but due to this 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.410
 Itâ€™s much easier for you to understand how 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.990
 done a bar spin if you do something 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.200
 not so much error is much easier to fix 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.120
 than the real bmx the next secret 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.220
 saunas bar is that you 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.800
 need to first try on the slope of the cinema 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.210
 fakes if your city does not have a narrow park 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.030
 auto think in archer you are 100 percent 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.580
 find some tattoo will be for and 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.530
 for wheelchairs or similar sample and 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.050
 the bar is first at the peak you will not 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.090
 scary as with bonika due to the fact that 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.740
 your position of the bike will be in the candle 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.810
 candles are always less scary to turn the steering wheel 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.240
 do a couple of times check bath 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.280
 clamp the bike forward feel 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.770
 the moment that you will turn the steering wheel 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.330
 now we try at first it will be scary 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.820
 you have already practiced the accordion atrovent 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.860
 so get together don't try your 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.140
 first bar spin in life if you 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.780
 feel that something is going wrong 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.850
 I advise all just bite it's better 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.000
 the bike will fall between your legs than we somehow 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.040
 land with the wheel turned if you 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.050
 well trained lords on a bike without 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.040
 wheels mystery fakie you make without 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.830
 special work 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.750
 but if you already took sick fakes then this 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.630
 bar wall on jumped left to do 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.410
 just one step and a couple of times 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.840
 good bani hop 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.640
 consider all your moves if 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.860
 feel you are not ready to do something 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.190
 and more importantly africa or a bar on a bike without 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.350
 wheels to gain more confidence 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.840
 the main thing is to be confident if 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.300
 you sure means you are not afraid means 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.640
 you make a masterly and when you make it 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.160
 stability did not do as often as possible 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.740
 Come as you like it 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.940
 like invested by hand enter 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.770
 like to let go 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.840
 sure and if you won't be tinkering and 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.060
 go through the learning phase bar spin about 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.700
 which now told you all 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.920
 it will turn out but it is better to study the bar 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.650
 sphinx radius or at least tack 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.510
 this tutorial on the back ends 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.900
 and I liked this video myself then put 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.220
 Like can also make a repost and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.950
 subscribe to the channel on u tube there 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.229
 tutorials out first and now 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.360
 you can still visit schools 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.669
 online with cubes we are at the point where you are 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.100
 can comment chat and there 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.410
 much more convenient to watch the video all 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.430
 with you was Dima gazelle come next
