and it's something that I've wanted for
a<00:00:11.070> while<00:00:11.219> since<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.639> came<00:00:11.759> out<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:11.969> 2006<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:13.190> in

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a while since it came out in 2006 and in

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670 
a while since it came out in 2006 and in
2006<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.780> not<00:00:15.990> all<00:00:16.049> that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
2006 it was really not all that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.590 
2006 it was really not all that
options<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.340> either<00:00:17.460> hitting<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> sheds

device<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.359> that<00:03:17.420> yeah<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:19.579> that's<00:03:19.760> pretty

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
device and that yeah and that's pretty

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.640 
device and that yeah and that's pretty
cool<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.750> that's<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.989> pretty<00:03:21.200> cool<00:03:21.410> feature

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
cool and that's a pretty cool feature

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.800 
cool and that's a pretty cool feature
but<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.160> think<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.820> always<00:03:23.060> gonna<00:03:23.390> be<00:03:23.600> back

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
but I think this is always gonna be back

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.259 
but I think this is always gonna be back
there<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.579> mean<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.760> think<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.329> fits<00:03:26.630> all<00:03:27.079> sizes

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
there I mean I think it fits all sizes

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.930 
there I mean I think it fits all sizes
on<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.510> box<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.900> shows<00:03:29.930> dispenser<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.430> why<00:03:31.700> not

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
on the box it shows dispenser so why not

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.130 
on the box it shows dispenser so why not
Spencer's<00:03:32.450> right<00:03:32.690> here

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.960 

of<00:03:36.140> course<00:03:36.470> why<00:03:36.680> wouldn't<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:37.010> these<00:03:37.430> people

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
of course why wouldn't it these people

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.509 
of course why wouldn't it these people
this<00:03:38.269> these<00:03:38.720> engines<00:03:39.079> of<00:03:39.769> course<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.130> does<00:03:40.310> I

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
this these engines of course it does I

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.380 
this these engines of course it does I
think<00:03:41.180> they're<00:03:41.329> shoot<00:03:41.600> out<00:03:41.720> farther<00:03:42.049> or<00:03:42.530> not

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
think they're shoot out farther or not

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.430 
think they're shoot out farther or not
