00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.110

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.629
 Today I introduce you to the palio kroboth 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.219
 in front of the currently on the 1.4 and 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.250
 this also adds a lot of new ones 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.560
 Add dinosaurs and a new world 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:28.910
 but more you will learn after the intro till 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:31.430
 It would be the same again 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.710
 as I said new the nut and so he 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.380
 the nut and a new world at all 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.699
 and we will hang you need only 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.070
 time this item here 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.050
 this is a fossil power team with 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.600
 stones and one arm bone in the middle 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.550
 that's why you need moscow to do that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.649
 he in a form of a normal 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.070
 portal and does a right click so 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.629
 I have to get her out of dungeons then 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.079
 just by the way then there's yes 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.409
 there is still this trio of forestry there 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.030
 you 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.550
 there is a new world there is then 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.590
 just a few new blocks can be there for a short time 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.440
 show how the tree looks like he does 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.470
 then there's something else 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.670
 Of course in the water is good for us 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.410
 Just go to the world and 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.420
 that's what the world looks like, so there is 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.810
 other boy so the colors very different 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.430
 And that is exactly how the world can be 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 here unfortunately the night you can not 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.610
 You can skip the daytime 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.850
 Do not change what a pity 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.500
 but it is not that bad 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.080
 ok i want to say then just caught 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.410
 We start with that 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.600
 trauma traumlos august so please now 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.730
 not somehow dislike me 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.810
 so now i pronounced that i did 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.150
 always find it very difficult especially 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.050
 at sodi please do not start the plant 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.490
 That's why yes, but yes it is 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 your decision is good 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.870
 I would say let's start 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 You can discuss these topics with Robbie Frack 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.910
 and so he counted followed and 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.440
 everywhere and if we are for example 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.420
 attacking Munich then you attack the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.739
 and kill them but then stop that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.040
 He only does it with others in Munich 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.360
 Not 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.890
 yes, I 'll just do it next time 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.030
 further this is the demo foto that is 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.420
 Here is such a small aircraft at the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.349
 currently very aggressive and enough 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.930
 place fifa and the frustration now and then 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.340
 Sometimes Munich will attack you 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.580
 such are the theaters that are the whole 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.269
 clearly making noise everywhere are oh no 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 do not die is a herbivore 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.040
 but they also eat a lot 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.040
 Munich 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.410
 then there is the barry marie jo nix 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:55.049
 that's just how I think so 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.580
 say so the typical 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.900
 carnivore and the deadline tends 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.090
 actually also munich but not always 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.690
 so most of the time he's so different dino 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:10.560
 should rain - and go through too 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.560
 really much of the mipcom bittere away 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.560
 then there is still the city partie that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.570
 this is the deadline too very much 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.209
 It looks like a chicken too 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.250
 anyway a turkey and a 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.470
 This bird also has a special feature and 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.260
 although if you are with and to any 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 a low point goes then then 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.890
 he drowns namely because the can 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:46.980
 not so good from somewhere a spot 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:46.980
 drilled here is our tamed romeos 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.410
 augusta 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.130
 it will get the same damage it took 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.630
 only a short moment because the can has 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.770
 not at all that can not be done at all 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.270
 bad there can not even high 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.010
 others can already swim that 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.580
 but currently just too stupid for that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.100
 are you coming with it? 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.960
 Now he's missing out on the crawling now 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.580
 downstairs and yes I think that's a pity 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.190
 you can not skip the weather here 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:26.860
 can and then finally we come 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:29.110
 He is here for the big party 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.570
 the league lowdon london no idea how 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.940
 it's pronounced that since this 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.110
 really nice with the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210
 tail fin again the moves and so on 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.250
 but that would just be too small 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.310
 in bagdad from the chrome or comes there 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.450
 in the country 100 will intervene 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.700
 if you attack then and did with it 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.320
 absolutely nothing on points of experience 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:56.320
 that's the only good thing here is the water 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.940
 now synonymous of the lot if the mod 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.669
 like it stay tuned because I 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.640
 Show yourself on the desktop now 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:08.740
 installation right here so 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.440
 we go back to the desktop too 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.910
 Installation of the mods what you need 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.010
 These two files are once the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.990
 murder itself and the micro forge as 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.010
 installer, he just goes to the 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.780
 I link like my description 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.970
 sat scrolls simple and tank is 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.010
 at both files here on download 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.690
 then you just start with start and he 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.340
 the windowless execution and are also 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.350
 percent from tata percent on and presses 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.780
 ok then the points minecraft goes 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.220
 folder versions and see here we have 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.410
 So do not minecraft installed 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.210
 we double click on the installer there 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.910
 you have to choose in siders press ok 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.340
 wait and see if it will be okay if we are 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.290
 go back to the mozilla and move 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.669
 just the motto in and so is the 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.620
 murder also already installed goes completely 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.330
 fast and easy with problem 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.340
 just write in the comments and 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.650
 we just try to answer it 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.510
 create a little so there are 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.190
 sometimes the conductors something quite 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.370
 especially so many who do not 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.889
 can decide 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.080
 But he does not care, just let it go 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.060
 a rating because we find the murder 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.229
 and how you find the video and there 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.610
 I would say thanks for watching 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.610
 skin in until next time
