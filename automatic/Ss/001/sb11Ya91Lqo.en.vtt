also<00:01:47.340> slide<00:01:47.939> them<00:01:48.149> back<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.960> split

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
also slide them back so you can split

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.929 
also slide them back so you can split
the<00:01:49.710> legroom<00:01:49.890> between<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> second<00:01:50.759> row<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

the first row and also the third row and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.350 
the first row and also the third row and
that's<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.430> how<00:01:53.579> much<00:01:53.790> difference<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that's about how much difference it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.860 
that's about how much difference it
makes<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
makes and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.340 
makes and
seeds<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.610> vehicle<00:01:57.000> does<00:01:57.120> have<00:01:57.350> rear

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
seeds this vehicle does have rear

seeds this vehicle does have rear
climate<00:01:58.800> control<00:01:59.070> settings<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.730> both

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
climate control settings so both

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.850 
climate control settings so both
passengers<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.780> rear<00:02:00.810> will<00:02:01.470> have<00:02:01.650> their
