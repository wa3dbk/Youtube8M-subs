00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.340
 going on here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.410
 a place to explain 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.420
 will be like a rally of bikers so 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.289
 come on a bike the car is better not not 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 need a court machine 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 try on bikes the machine is not 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.340
 welcome shoot the fuck here 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 I do not know that in short this place is like us 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.630
 will be meeting with the initial starting 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.969
 point of departure 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 this is squared she 13 if by 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.020
 map squares and if on the map then 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.730
 see somewhere is it up to here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.340
 can move way by bus but if 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.010
 jump over here over here that rides on 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.500
 mine here from here you can jump yes and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 run a little 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 just about in general here is not quite close 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.030
 from hp and as if from near them well 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.340
 far from him but it doesn't matter here 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.829
 the place will be the starting point and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.350
 on bikes on bikes exactly bikes we 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.750
 going around the state on the freeway i 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 just flyover lisap autobahn therefore 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.860
 the main thing that is it will be like this 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 we go all 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 But in general, and on the screen and now see 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.810
 as an item to whom how are we going to go and 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 which route in general along the way we 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.009
 probably will not stop and if 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.940
 will be that but I will say shorter in general 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.040
 will end all on 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.710
 the beaches of santa maria on that pier here 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.480
 which is the way behind the back to see hair visible 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.640
 behind there is a far pier 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.770
 some threshold of entertainment which 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.190
 far with benches which such 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.530
 wide shorter here then we will go again 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.260
 from this 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 shouted at the fuel on the bikes we 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.820
 let's climb the mountain of brow 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.890
 only without undercutting guys then 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.740
 what else can we do we can then 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.530
 go don't know home diner well yes 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.000
 and the Jedi Judah a Jew 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.250
 level 25 thousand in the end we are already there 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 decide on what we will do if 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 admin and help with some thing 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.530
 your very think very much if nothing 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.929
 will not by course we will go 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.060
 the club is supposedly jeezy as always 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.220
 by standard and in general then on this 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.070
 probably everything will be there already further 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.710
 improvisation completely at random all 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.530
 It will be the main thing that should pass exactly at 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.170
 us correctly without hesitation so that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.700
 surely a guy has passed it a hundred 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.190
 percent so we humanly 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.620
 drove along the overpass all the whole living 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.620
 so no meat no smoke here 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.810
 this is the most important adequate 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.670
 rpk we have rp organizations now and again 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.470
 bikers so it's not quite 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.020
 gathering is a gathering of bikers so more 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.690
 lush you have to be this don't understand 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.820
 you need to happy drop there taxes need 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.320
 yell each with at least two brackets 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.390
 put more or less somehow here 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.010
 what else did I want to say well in general on 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.440
 preferably on balls well of course you know 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.019
 that the cars will come but this is also not 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.260
 comme il faut a in general about how we 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.180
 will certainly not know I will not 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.280
 of course not to make everyone drive from behind 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.930
 because it is unrealistic so we will 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.720
 drive erratically but absolutely forward you are not 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.209
 hijacking this is the most important thing 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.890
 cars if it is not to go for bikes 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.930
 guys if you are by car that is and for 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.720
 with bikes it is necessary itself it is important 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.519
 because your car lays it all 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.640
 bike all the bikes will fly for a friend 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.490
 friend and 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.310
 close not go we go across the width 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.170
 roads even though it does not matter we are going 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.920
 across the width of the road no one lives us 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.130
 and then we will if you go on the right so 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.770
 a drop of holiday dripping i'm fooling everyone 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:48.920
 Well , in general, the map you saw the way waiting 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.340
 all 21 numbers after tomorrow in that place 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.220
 where I showed at 14 00 Moscow time 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.230
 time and probably still create cum on the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.290
 great khali in which I can speak 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.580
 probably but at the moment started 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.800
 I will speak only one 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.940
 you heard what's going on and to 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.140
 to coordinate and 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.910
 Well, you know, well, to hear that 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.390
 happens and where to go this is the most 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.910
 important 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.910
 And so in general, then on this all the same spirit there
