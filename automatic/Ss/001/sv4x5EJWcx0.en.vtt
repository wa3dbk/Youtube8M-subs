00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
three four five six seven eight so if

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.640 
three four five six seven eight so if
you're<00:02:55.090> doing<00:02:55.240> one<00:02:55.840> without<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.110> cover<00:02:56.380> which

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
you're doing one without a cover which

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.840 
you're doing one without a cover which
is<00:02:56.680> plain<00:02:56.980> white<00:02:57.130> paper<00:02:57.160> you'd<00:02:57.520> actually<00:02:57.700> have

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
is plain white paper you'd actually have

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.180 
is plain white paper you'd actually have
nine<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.360> ten<00:02:58.570> pages<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.860> what<00:02:59.980> I've<00:03:00.070> done

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
nine and ten pages so so what I've done

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.340 
nine and ten pages so so what I've done
is<00:03:00.310> I've<00:03:00.459> made<00:03:00.880> three<00:03:01.630> more<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.900> these<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.230> I'll

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
is I've made three more of these so I'll

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.680 
is I've made three more of these so I'll
have<00:03:02.590> four<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:04.150> would<00:03:04.300> give<00:03:04.420> me<00:03:04.480> four

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
have four and that would give me four

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170 
have four and that would give me four
times<00:03:04.870> eight<00:03:05.200> pages<00:03:05.590> four<00:03:06.520> times<00:03:06.760> eight<00:03:07.150> is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
times eight pages four times eight is

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.600 
times eight pages four times eight is
twenty-four<00:03:07.740> eight<00:03:08.740> to<00:03:08.890> sixteen<00:03:09.280> thirty<00:03:09.459> to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
twenty-four eight to sixteen thirty to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.230 
twenty-four eight to sixteen thirty to
thirty<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.030> five<00:03:10.240> math<00:03:10.570> oh<00:03:11.550> boy<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.150> that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
thirty to five math oh boy and so that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.449 
thirty to five math oh boy and so that
I'm<00:03:13.300> going<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.480> put<00:03:13.600> them<00:03:13.660> all<00:03:13.810> together<00:03:14.459> here

line up the edge you should get a nice
straight<00:04:39.040> fold<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:39.730> should<00:04:39.910> be<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.600> know

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
straight fold and it should be you know

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.170 
straight fold and it should be you know
the<00:04:40.840> same<00:04:41.050> all<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.290> way<00:04:41.380> down<00:04:41.590> okay<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.640> then

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
the same all the way down okay and then

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.900 
the same all the way down okay and then
I'm<00:04:43.270> going<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.450> do<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.720> again<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.850> want<00:04:45.850> to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
I'm going to do that again I want to

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.130 
I'm going to do that again I want to
leave<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.060> little<00:04:46.300> bit<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.600> wiggle<00:04:46.840> room<00:04:46.900> not<00:04:47.110> a

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
leave a little bit of wiggle room not a

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.720 
leave a little bit of wiggle room not a
time<00:04:47.410> just<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.680> little<00:04:47.920> bit<00:04:48.040> though<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:48.460> I'll<00:04:48.580> be

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
time just a little bit though so I'll be

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.460 
time just a little bit though so I'll be
able<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.630> know<00:04:49.660> get<00:04:49.900> these<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.200> flaps

able to you know get these the flaps

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
able to you know get these the flaps
around<00:04:50.680> my<00:04:50.950> book<00:04:52.800> okay<00:04:53.800> hopefully<00:04:54.040> that's<00:04:54.340> not

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
around my book okay hopefully that's not

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.630 
around my book okay hopefully that's not
gonna<00:04:54.640> be<00:04:54.790> too<00:04:55.000> tight<00:04:55.330> just<00:04:56.400> line<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.430> up<00:04:57.580> to

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
gonna be too tight just line it up to

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.560 
gonna be too tight just line it up to
the<00:04:57.730> edge<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.419> crease<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.900> over<00:04:59.200> and<00:05:00.270> then<00:05:01.270> I

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
the edge and crease it over and then I

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.020 
the edge and crease it over and then I
also<00:05:01.840> like<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.260> fold<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.890> in<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.490> middle<00:05:06.030> okay

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
also like to fold it in the middle okay

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.100 
also like to fold it in the middle okay
and<00:05:07.150> then<00:05:07.240> I'm<00:05:07.330> going<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.540> look<00:05:07.690> at<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:07.960> and

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
and then I'm going to look at this and

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.420 
and then I'm going to look at this and
see<00:05:08.230> about<00:05:08.410> what<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.650> have<00:05:08.830> about<00:05:09.010> half<00:05:09.250> an

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
see about what do I have about half an

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.180 
see about what do I have about half an
inch<00:05:09.520> here<00:05:10.030> centimeter<00:05:10.540> or<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.890> I'm<00:05:12.040> gonna

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
inch here centimeter or so so I'm gonna

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.650 
inch here centimeter or so so I'm gonna
make<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.370> fold<00:05:12.669> next<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.060> this<00:05:13.180> one<00:05:13.419> about

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
make a fold next to this one about

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.409 
make a fold next to this one about
centimeter<00:05:14.200> away<00:05:17.640> again<00:05:18.640> if<00:05:18.850> was<00:05:19.090> long<00:05:19.240> thin

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
centimeter away again if was long thin

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.580 
centimeter away again if was long thin
line<00:05:19.570> upper<00:05:19.780> edges<00:05:19.930> we're<00:05:20.140> gonna<00:05:20.230> end<00:05:20.440> up<00:05:20.530> with

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
line upper edges we're gonna end up with

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.290 
line upper edges we're gonna end up with
nice<00:05:20.770> parallel<00:05:21.100> folds<00:05:21.840> okay<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:24.400> then<00:05:24.730> I'm

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
nice parallel folds okay and then I'm

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.480 
nice parallel folds okay and then I'm
gonna<00:05:25.419> put<00:05:25.750> my<00:05:25.960> book<00:05:26.260> in<00:05:26.500> here<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:27.130> figure<00:05:27.370> out

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
gonna put my book in here and figure out

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.320 
gonna put my book in here and figure out
how<00:05:27.760> far<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:28.740> need<00:05:29.740> for<00:05:29.979> my<00:05:30.070> next<00:05:30.400> fold<00:05:30.729> so<00:05:31.120> what

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
how far I need for my next fold so what

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
how far I need for my next fold so what
I'm<00:05:31.419> what<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.600> like<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.840> do<00:05:31.930> here<00:05:32.140> is<00:05:32.200> actually

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
I'm what I like to do here is actually

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.890 
I'm what I like to do here is actually
fold<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.830> back<00:05:33.130> just<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:33.640> can<00:05:33.940> really<00:05:34.540> see

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
fold it back just so I can really see

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.659 
fold it back just so I can really see
and<00:05:34.990> visualize<00:05:35.200> it<00:05:35.770> here<00:05:37.770> hold<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:38.890> there

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
and visualize it here hold it there

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.490 
and visualize it here hold it there
do<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:39.970> same<00:05:40.360> let<00:05:40.750> me<00:05:40.810> just<00:05:40.990> crease<00:05:41.200> that<00:05:43.500> that

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
do the same let me just crease that that

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.409 
do the same let me just crease that that
folding<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:45.250> down<00:05:45.340> it's<00:05:45.850> if<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:46.360> can

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
folding it down it's if you can

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.900 
folding it down it's if you can
pre-crease<00:05:47.260> things<00:05:47.530> you<00:05:47.830> know<00:05:47.950> it<00:05:48.610> really

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
pre-crease things you know it really

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.219 
pre-crease things you know it really
makes<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.180> big<00:05:49.210> difference<00:05:49.390> really<00:05:49.840> makes<00:05:50.080> it

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
makes a big difference really makes it

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.230 
makes a big difference really makes it
look<00:05:50.290> neat<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.040> tidy<00:05:51.400> and<00:05:51.810> um<00:05:53.820> do<00:05:54.820> it<00:05:54.970> again<00:05:55.150> on

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
look neat and tidy and um do it again on

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.140 
look neat and tidy and um do it again on
the<00:05:55.330> other<00:05:55.419> side<00:05:55.690> actually<00:05:56.530> probably<00:05:57.250> eyeball

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
the other side actually probably eyeball

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.700 
the other side actually probably eyeball
it<00:05:58.360> here<00:05:59.130> let's<00:06:00.130> see<00:06:00.520> I<00:06:01.229> think<00:06:02.229> I<00:06:02.560> could

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
it here let's see I think I could

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.260 
it here let's see I think I could
probably<00:06:02.860> I<00:06:03.100> think<00:06:03.130> that's<00:06:03.430> going<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.669> be<00:06:03.790> you

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
probably I think that's going to be you

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.909 
probably I think that's going to be you
can<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.660> can<00:06:04.810> adjust<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:05.290> don't<00:06:05.530> worry<00:06:05.710> if<00:06:05.830> you

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
can you can adjust it don't worry if you

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.650 
can you can adjust it don't worry if you
don't<00:06:06.010> have<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.280> exactly<00:06:06.610> right<00:06:09.390> okay<00:06:10.390> let's

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
don't have it exactly right okay let's

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.090 
don't have it exactly right okay let's
take<00:06:10.900> a<00:06:10.930> look<00:06:11.290> there<00:06:11.530> think<00:06:11.800> that's<00:06:11.919> pretty

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
take a look there think that's pretty

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.219 
take a look there think that's pretty
good<00:06:12.220> okay<00:06:12.520> now<00:06:13.180> we're<00:06:13.630> going<00:06:13.780> to<00:06:13.870> put<00:06:14.110> our

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
good okay now we're going to put our

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.040 
good okay now we're going to put our
booklet<00:06:14.590> in<00:06:15.390> okay<00:06:16.390> so<00:06:16.450> we've<00:06:16.690> got<00:06:16.810> our<00:06:16.900> little

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
booklet in okay so we've got our little

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.469 
booklet in okay so we've got our little
folded<00:06:17.470> spine<00:06:17.770> area<00:06:18.100> that<00:06:18.580> seems<00:06:18.880> to<00:06:19.090> be<00:06:19.240> about

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
folded spine area that seems to be about

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.159 
folded spine area that seems to be about
right<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.520> then<00:06:21.520> we<00:06:21.729> are<00:06:21.910> just<00:06:21.940> going<00:06:22.419> to

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
right and then we are just going to

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.390 
right and then we are just going to
slide<00:06:23.710> our<00:06:24.100> end<00:06:24.460> paper<00:06:25.270> or<00:06:25.630> in-page<00:06:26.310> into<00:06:27.310> the

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
slide our end paper or in-page into the

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.030 
slide our end paper or in-page into the
little<00:06:27.610> pocket<00:06:28.030> that<00:06:28.590> this<00:06:29.590> makes<00:06:29.770> look<00:06:29.919> at

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
little pocket that this makes look at

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.920 
little pocket that this makes look at
this<00:06:30.160> we're<00:06:30.310> doing<00:06:30.520> this<00:06:30.640> real<00:06:30.940> time<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.870> can

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
this we're doing this real time you can

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.480 
this we're doing this real time you can
totally<00:06:32.320> make<00:06:32.350> these<00:06:32.620> run<00:06:32.860> in<00:06:33.039> like<00:06:33.310> less<00:06:33.460> than

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
totally make these run in like less than

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.279 
totally make these run in like less than
ten<00:06:33.700> minutes<00:06:33.880> I<00:06:34.180> think<00:06:34.510> these<00:06:34.720> are<00:06:34.780> also<00:06:35.050> be

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
ten minutes I think these are also be
