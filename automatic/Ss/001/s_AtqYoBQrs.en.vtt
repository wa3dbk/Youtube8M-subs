we've<00:00:02.669> looked<00:00:02.790> at<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.000> few<00:00:03.030> different

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
we've looked at a few different

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.970 
we've looked at a few different
pinpointing<00:00:03.929> techniques<00:00:04.380> for<00:00:04.589> finding<00:00:04.740> a

pinpointing techniques for finding a
target<00:00:05.339> with<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.490> double<00:00:05.759> D<00:00:05.879> coil<00:00:06.210> now<00:00:07.140> that

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
target with a double D coil now that

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.690 
target with a double D coil now that
you've<00:00:07.440> pinpointed<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.130> want<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> recover

you've pinpointed it you want to recover

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.049 
you've pinpointed it you want to recover
it

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
it

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
it
the<00:00:09.809> only<00:00:09.929> thing<00:00:10.139> else<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.469> consider<00:00:10.800> here<00:00:11.040> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the only thing else to consider here is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.580 
the only thing else to consider here is
how<00:00:11.610> deep<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> target<00:00:12.330> might<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.500> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
how deep the target might be if it's a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.620 
how deep the target might be if it's a
coin<00:00:13.799> size<00:00:14.099> item<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:15.089> going<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.420> pretty

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
coin size item it's going to be pretty

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.880 
coin size item it's going to be pretty
accurate<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.139> what's<00:00:16.320> shown<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.590> your

detectors depth indicator because

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.529 
detectors depth indicator because
they're<00:00:18.930> geared<00:00:19.199> toward<00:00:19.500> coin<00:00:19.710> size<00:00:20.010> items

they're geared toward coin size items

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.970 
they're geared toward coin size items
items<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.689> much<00:00:21.810> smaller<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> larger<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.859> be

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
items are much smaller and larger can be

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.880 
items are much smaller and larger can be
a<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.189> different<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> demonstrate

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
a little different so to demonstrate

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.200 
a little different so to demonstrate
I've<00:00:25.890> got<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> little<00:00:26.340> round<00:00:26.609> ball<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
I've got a little round ball here a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.480 
I've got a little round ball here a
piece<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.660> lead<00:00:27.840> from<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> 1800s<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> live<00:00:29.310> in

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
piece of lead from the 1800s it live in

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.690 
piece of lead from the 1800s it live in
fired<00:00:29.730> shot<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.470> I've<00:00:31.590> also<00:00:31.769> got<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> soda<00:00:32.399> can

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
fired shot and I've also got a soda can

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.610 
fired shot and I've also got a soda can
which<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> flattened<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.380> you've<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
which is flattened out so you've got a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.979 
which is flattened out so you've got a
large<00:00:34.890> target<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.579> small<00:00:36.149> target<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.719> addition

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
large target a small target in addition

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
large target a small target in addition
to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> coin<00:00:37.320> size<00:00:37.590> target<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:39.090> we'll<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to the coin size target what we'll do is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.459 
to the coin size target what we'll do is
we're<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> put<00:00:39.930> these<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.230> ground

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
we're going to put these in the ground

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.069 
we're going to put these in the ground
I'm<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> put<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.850> soda<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:42.629> deep

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I'm going to put this soda can down deep

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
I'm going to put this soda can down deep
in<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.500> hole<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.210> what's<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> rumor<00:00:46.020> I'll

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
in this hole and what's the rumor I'll

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.799 
in this hole and what's the rumor I'll
show<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:50.329> about<00:00:51.329> six<00:00:51.570> inches

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
show you that it is about six inches

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.819 
show you that it is about six inches
deep<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.379> once<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.070> bury<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> there

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
deep or so once I bury it up in there

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.110 
deep or so once I bury it up in there
and<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:55.949> gonna<00:00:56.039> put<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.399> piece<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.640> lead<00:00:56.940> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and I'm gonna put this piece of lead in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
and I'm gonna put this piece of lead in
the<00:00:57.210> ground<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> three<00:00:58.859> inch<00:00:59.039> depth

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the ground it's about a three inch depth

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.689 
the ground it's about a three inch depth
so<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.329> small<00:01:00.570> target<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.260> shallow<00:01:01.699> I'm

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
so it's a small target it's shallow I'm

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.920 
so it's a small target it's shallow I'm
gonna<00:01:02.910> bury<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.539> right<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:06.390> I'm

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
gonna bury that up right there and I'm

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.859 
gonna bury that up right there and I'm
gonna<00:01:07.049> mark<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.280> blue<00:01:08.610> chip<00:01:08.909> then

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
gonna mark it with this blue chip then

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
gonna mark it with this blue chip then
our<00:01:10.049> soda<00:01:10.320> cup<00:01:10.770> I'm<00:01:10.979> gonna<00:01:11.130> put<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> bunch<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
our soda cup I'm gonna put a bunch of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.960 
our soda cup I'm gonna put a bunch of
soil<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> bury<00:01:13.409> him<00:01:13.619> deep<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
soil on that and bury him deep so that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
soil on that and bury him deep so that
he's<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> good<00:01:15.509> six<00:01:15.840> inch<00:01:16.049> depth<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:19.650> again

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
he's it a good six inch depth and again

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.320 
he's it a good six inch depth and again
I'll<00:01:20.159> mark<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> top<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> him<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I'll mark the top of him with this

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.960 
I'll mark the top of him with this
orange<00:01:21.600> chip<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> come<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.580> over<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
orange chip so we can come back over and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
orange chip so we can come back over and
know<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.840> we'll<00:01:25.560> take<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> look

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
know where that is and we'll take a look

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.600 
know where that is and we'll take a look
at<00:01:26.250> size<00:01:26.759> versus<00:01:27.299> depth<00:01:31.070> now<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.340> buried

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
at size versus depth now that we buried

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
at size versus depth now that we buried
the<00:01:32.790> small<00:01:33.060> item<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> large<00:01:33.810> item<00:01:34.229> let's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the small item and the large item let's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.230 
the small item and the large item let's
go<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.130> over<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.909> our<00:01:36.000> depth

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
go back over it and see what our depth

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.460 
go back over it and see what our depth
indication<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.350> two<00:01:37.500> items

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.520 

eight<00:01:45.070> inches<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:46.870> get<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.140> coil<00:01:47.350> right

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
eight inches if I get the coil right

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.960 
eight inches if I get the coil right
down<00:01:47.710> flat<00:01:48.010> on<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.190> ground<00:01:48.430> I've<00:01:48.580> got<00:01:48.700> six

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
down flat on the ground I've got six

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
down flat on the ground I've got six
inches

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
inches

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
inches
so<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.240> double<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.659> actual<00:01:52.080> depth<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so that's double the actual depth of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
so that's double the actual depth of
three<00:01:52.740> inches<00:01:52.979> where<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.280> buried<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.700> little

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
three inches where we buried that little

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
three inches where we buried that little
tiny<00:01:54.210> musket<00:01:54.840> ball<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.830> let's<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
tiny musket ball now let's go over the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.980 
tiny musket ball now let's go over the
big<00:01:56.400> target

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.780 

two<00:02:03.890> inches<00:02:04.070> on<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.460> depth

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.850 

so<00:02:08.479> that's<00:02:08.720> six<00:02:09.020> inches<00:02:09.290> deep<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.740> it's

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
so that's six inches deep and it's

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.210 
so that's six inches deep and it's
showing<00:02:10.040> only<00:02:10.310> two<00:02:10.550> inches<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.080> here<00:02:12.530> is

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
showing only two inches this one here is

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.530 
showing only two inches this one here is
three<00:02:13.580> inches<00:02:13.850> deep<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.950> shows<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.580> six

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
three inches deep but it shows to be six

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300 
three inches deep but it shows to be six
to<00:02:17.690> eight<00:02:17.780> inches

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
to eight inches

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.760 
to eight inches
that's<00:02:19.880> what<00:02:20.090> effect<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.140> size<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.620> these

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
that's what effect the size of these

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's what effect the size of these
items<00:02:22.130> has<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
items has on it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.270 
items has on it
coin<00:02:23.150> size<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.630> optimal<00:02:24.080> smaller<00:02:24.800> or<00:02:25.100> much

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
coin size is optimal smaller or much

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.949 
coin size is optimal smaller or much
larger<00:02:25.670> than<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> coin<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.390> gonna<00:02:26.480> affect

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
larger than the coin it's gonna affect

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.470 
larger than the coin it's gonna affect
the<00:02:27.500> reading<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> depth<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:29.300> what

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
the reading of the depth so that's what

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.970 
the reading of the depth so that's what
we're<00:02:29.600> gonna<00:02:29.690> see<00:02:29.959> on<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.319> so<00:02:30.530> let's<00:02:30.709> go<00:02:30.830> back

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
we're gonna see on this so let's go back

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.370 
we're gonna see on this so let's go back
over<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.550> decide<00:02:32.209> how<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.690> tell<00:02:32.930> if<00:02:33.230> it's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
over and decide how can you tell if it's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.250 
over and decide how can you tell if it's
bigger<00:02:33.650> or<00:02:33.890> smaller<00:02:34.040> than<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.550> coin<00:02:34.730> size

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
bigger or smaller than a coin size

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.420 
bigger or smaller than a coin size
anything<00:02:36.260> much<00:02:36.440> smaller<00:02:36.739> than<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> coin<00:02:37.190> size

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
anything much smaller than the coin size

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.920 
anything much smaller than the coin size
item<00:02:37.730> you're<00:02:37.850> going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> lose<00:02:38.239> real<00:02:38.569> quick<00:02:38.780> if

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
item you're going to lose real quick if

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.690 
item you're going to lose real quick if
you<00:02:39.020> lift<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.350> coil<00:02:39.620> off<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.950> ground<00:02:40.190> for

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
you lift the coil off the ground for

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.380 
you lift the coil off the ground for
example

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.290 

as<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.950> lift<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.220> coil<00:02:46.580> off<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.910> ground<00:02:47.150> I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
as I lift that coil off the ground I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.210 
as I lift that coil off the ground I
lose<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:47.900> target<00:02:48.319> right<00:02:48.590> away<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.100> know

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
lose that target right away so I know

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.610 
lose that target right away so I know
that<00:02:49.490> it's<00:02:49.640> small<00:02:49.900> when<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:50.959> go<00:02:51.110> over<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.319> can

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
that it's small when I go over this can

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.360 
that it's small when I go over this can
I'm<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.069> keep<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.310> much<00:02:52.730> higher

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
I'm going to keep that much higher

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.140 
I'm going to keep that much higher
pinpoint

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.550 

I'm<00:03:01.150> still<00:03:01.420> reading<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.750> pretty<00:03:02.110> high<00:03:02.320> off

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
I'm still reading that pretty high off

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.050 
I'm still reading that pretty high off
the<00:03:02.770> ground<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.190> foot<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:03.610> off<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.820> ground

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
the ground a foot or so off the ground

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.600 
the ground a foot or so off the ground
I'll<00:03:04.210> go<00:03:04.300> back<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.480> even<00:03:04.720> swing<00:03:05.020> over<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:09.430> I

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
I'll go back and even swing over it if I

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.340 
I'll go back and even swing over it if I
can<00:03:09.760> lift<00:03:09.940> my<00:03:10.030> coil<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.570> far<00:03:10.840> off<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.170> ground

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
can lift my coil that far off the ground

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.230 
can lift my coil that far off the ground
and<00:03:11.620> still<00:03:11.800> get<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> good<00:03:12.220> solid<00:03:12.550> reading<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:13.090> it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
and still get a good solid reading on it

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.540 
and still get a good solid reading on it
I<00:03:13.420> know<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:13.960> much<00:03:14.290> larger<00:03:14.620> than<00:03:14.920> the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
I know that it's much larger than the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.940 
I know that it's much larger than the
size<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> coin<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:17.260> best<00:03:17.440> way<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.650> test
