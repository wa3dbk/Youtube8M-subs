Guard<00:05:17.800> set<00:05:18.099> that<00:05:18.280> had<00:05:18.520> some<00:05:19.270> of<00:05:19.360> these<00:05:19.419> in<00:05:19.599> and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
Guard set that had some of these in and

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.200 
Guard set that had some of these in and
I<00:05:20.770> actually<00:05:20.919> really<00:05:21.550> do<00:05:21.729> like<00:05:21.760> these<00:05:22.000> think

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
I actually really do like these think

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.480 
I actually really do like these think
that<00:05:22.360> panini<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.710> get<00:05:23.860> too<00:05:24.070> many<00:05:24.190> figures

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
that panini you do get too many figures

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.860 
that panini you do get too many figures
in<00:05:24.669> this<00:05:24.849> set<00:05:26.370> these<00:05:27.370> two<00:05:27.550> guys<00:05:27.700> here<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.660> this

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
in this set these two guys here and this

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.110 
in this set these two guys here and this
is<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.050> twenty<00:05:29.500> dollar<00:05:29.680> set<00:05:30.010> so<00:05:30.280> again<00:05:30.849> one<00:05:31.090> of

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
is a twenty dollar set so again one of

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.960 
is a twenty dollar set so again one of
the<00:05:31.360> cheaper<00:05:31.690> ones<00:05:31.950> I<00:05:32.950> would<00:05:33.190> recommend<00:05:33.729> it<00:05:33.820> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970
