hi<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.259> cardiovascular<00:00:13.259> system<00:00:13.290> I

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
hi this is the cardiovascular system I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.840 
hi this is the cardiovascular system I
have<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> question<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.449> go<00:00:18.449> ahead

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
have a question for you go ahead

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.590 
have a question for you go ahead
what<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.350> cardiovascular<00:00:22.350> system<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
what is the cardiovascular system the

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.689 
what is the cardiovascular system the
cardiovascular<00:00:24.600> system<00:00:25.130> includes<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> heart

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
cardiovascular system includes the heart

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.830 
cardiovascular system includes the heart
and<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> blood<00:00:27.330> vessels<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.789> hot<00:00:29.789> buns<00:00:30.150> blood

the<00:01:11.610> blood<00:01:12.090> carries<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.020> good--nice<00:01:14.010> oxygen

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the blood carries the good--nice oxygen

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.980 
the blood carries the good--nice oxygen
and<00:01:15.210> nutrients<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> body<00:01:17.100> needs<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
and nutrients that the body needs and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
and nutrients that the body needs and
carries<00:01:18.990> away<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> rotten<00:01:20.100> dirty<00:01:20.490> carbon

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
carries away the rotten dirty carbon

sound your heart makes duck duck Duck

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.759 
sound your heart makes duck duck Duck
Duck<00:03:09.850> comes<00:03:10.850> from<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.690> sound<00:03:12.079> of<00:03:12.410> these

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
Duck comes from the sound of these

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.930 
Duck comes from the sound of these
valves<00:03:13.519> opening<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.829> closing<00:03:15.940> blood
