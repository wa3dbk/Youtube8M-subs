00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
maybe it's just hormonal it's I just

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.869 
maybe it's just hormonal it's I just
haven't<00:00:40.650> been<00:00:40.710> able<00:00:40.830> to<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.309> keep<00:00:41.519> up<00:00:41.730> with

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
haven't been able to really keep up with

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.780 
haven't been able to really keep up with
it<00:00:41.970> as<00:00:42.089> much<00:00:42.269> as<00:00:42.449> usual<00:00:42.839> and<00:00:43.430> because<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
it as much as usual and because it's so

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.790 
it as much as usual and because it's so
humid<00:00:45.239> outside<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.809> seems<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.470> usual

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
humid outside it seems like my usual

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.280 
humid outside it seems like my usual
routine<00:00:47.370> isn't<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.390> keeping<00:00:49.170> my

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
routine isn't like really keeping my

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.920 
routine isn't like really keeping my
hair<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.769> very<00:00:49.949> long<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.550> thus<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> started

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
hair for very long and thus so I started

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.240 
hair for very long and thus so I started
wearing<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> pulled<00:00:52.469> back<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> lot<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> know

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
wearing it pulled back a lot and I know

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.569 
wearing it pulled back a lot and I know
that<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> doesn't<00:00:53.850> work<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.090> my<00:00:54.360> hair<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
that that doesn't work for my hair so I

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
that that doesn't work for my hair so I
decided<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> braided<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> hopefully

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
decided to get it braided and hopefully

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
decided to get it braided and hopefully
I'll<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.230> able<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> keep<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> braided<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
I'll be able to keep it braided for a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.439 
I'll be able to keep it braided for a
little<00:00:59.610> while<00:00:59.760> until<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> baby<00:01:00.360> comes<00:01:00.620> so

in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> beginning<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.960> ends<00:01:52.320> tend<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> puff

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
in the beginning the ends tend to puff

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399 
in the beginning the ends tend to puff
up<00:01:53.070> once<00:01:53.340> everything<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.820> dry<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.140> for

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
up once everything is dry but I like for

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
up once everything is dry but I like for
it<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:56.070> smooth<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:57.119> I'm<00:01:57.210> doing<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it to be really smooth what I'm doing is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.440 
it to be really smooth what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:57.810> taking<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.560> flat<00:01:58.860> iron<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.579> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I'm taking my flat iron and this is just

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
I'm taking my flat iron and this is just
like<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.619> cheap<00:02:01.829> flat

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
like a really really really cheap flat

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.929 
like a really really really cheap flat
iron<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:04.460> want<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> say<00:02:05.700> between

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
iron it was like I want to say between

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.120 
iron it was like I want to say between
seven<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.509> ten<00:02:06.750> dollars<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.829> doesn't

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
seven and ten dollars so it doesn't

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.560 
seven and ten dollars so it doesn't
really<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.429> very<00:02:08.610> hot<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
really get very hot and that's what you

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.880 
really get very hot and that's what you
actually<00:02:09.750> need<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.619> with<00:02:10.799> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
actually need to do this with the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050 
actually need to do this with the
synthetic<00:02:11.100> here<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:11.850> end<00:02:11.970> up

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
synthetic here so you don't end up

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.390 
synthetic here so you don't end up
burning<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.450> off<00:02:12.570> unless<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.920> one<00:02:14.280> of

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
burning it off unless you have one of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940 
burning it off unless you have one of
those<00:02:14.549> flat<00:02:14.970> irons<00:02:15.299> with<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.950> heat

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
those flat irons with the heat

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.160 
those flat irons with the heat
regulators<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.630> course<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:19.049> don't

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
regulators on it but of course I don't

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.740 
regulators on it but of course I don't
flat<00:02:19.709> iron<00:02:19.890> mine<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:21.360> not<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
flat iron mine here so I'm not going to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
flat iron mine here so I'm not going to
invest<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.230> bunch<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.470> money<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:23.160> flat<00:02:23.700> iron

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
invest a bunch of money in a flat iron

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.530 
invest a bunch of money in a flat iron
just<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:25.459> just<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.549> do<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.880> synthetic<00:02:27.209> here

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
just to just to do this synthetic here

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.090 
just to just to do this synthetic here
too<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.410> feel<00:02:28.709> it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
too but I do feel it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.790 
too but I do feel it
to<00:02:29.190> keep<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.880> little<00:02:30.060> rank<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.510> need<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.930> so

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
to keep this little rank I need this so

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.970 
to keep this little rank I need this so
what<00:02:32.700> I'm<00:02:32.820> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.060> do<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.830> going

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
what I'm going to do so I'm just going

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.540 
what I'm going to do so I'm just going
to<00:02:35.010> take<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> section<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:37.650> how<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.100> ends

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
to take a section you see how the ends

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.140 
to take a section you see how the ends
look<00:02:38.760> were<00:02:38.970> they<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.670> testing

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
look were they like that and I'm testing

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.640 
look were they like that and I'm testing
this<00:02:42.270> out<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.660> make<00:02:42.810> sure<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:43.500> not

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
this out to make sure that it's not

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.780 
this out to make sure that it's not
something<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.100> going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> singe<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
something that's going to singe the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.400 
something that's going to singe the
braids<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:46.410> take<00:02:46.590> them<00:02:46.770> off<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:48.260> put<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
braids and just take them off I put it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.700 
braids and just take them off I put it
on<00:02:52.100> test<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> make<00:02:53.460> sure<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.910> not<00:02:54.000> too<00:02:54.210> hot

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
on test it to make sure it's not too hot

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.800 
on test it to make sure it's not too hot
very<00:02:55.710> important<00:02:57.560> let's<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.740> bring<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.070> down

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
very important let's just bring it down

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.040 
very important let's just bring it down
and<00:03:01.310> instantly<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:03.870> nice<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.260> flat<00:03:04.880> and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and instantly it's nice and flat and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.000 
and instantly it's nice and flat and
then<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.350> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.710> through<00:03:07.950> my

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
then I'm just going to go through my

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.360 
then I'm just going to go through my
hair<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.710> everything<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.160> don't

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
hair and do everything and you don't

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.110 
hair and do everything and you don't
necessarily<00:03:11.490> need<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> take<00:03:12.420> small<00:03:12.810> sections

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
necessarily need to take small sections

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.790 
necessarily need to take small sections
because<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.390> course<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.110> synthetic<00:03:16.500> you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
because of course this is synthetic you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320 
because of course this is synthetic you
don't<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> worry<00:03:17.490> about<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.910> health<00:03:18.150> of

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
don't have to worry about the health of

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.810 
don't have to worry about the health of
it<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.800> guess<00:03:19.800> in<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.070> very<00:03:20.280> beginning<00:03:20.730> I

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
it I guess in the very beginning I

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.520 
it I guess in the very beginning I
normally<00:03:21.150> take<00:03:21.330> small<00:03:21.630> sections<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:22.380> in

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
normally take small sections just in

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.280 
normally take small sections just in
case<00:03:22.710> I'm<00:03:22.950> misjudging<00:03:23.540> what's<00:03:24.540> going<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.050> with

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
case I'm misjudging what's going on with

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.460 
case I'm misjudging what's going on with
it

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
it

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.670 
it
and<00:03:25.880> closer<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.090> baby<00:03:27.270> just<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.290> case<00:03:28.440> I'm

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
and closer to a baby just in case I'm

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.450 
and closer to a baby just in case I'm
just<00:03:29.040> judging<00:03:29.370> how<00:03:29.970> hot<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.810> irons<00:03:31.260> are<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
just judging how hot the irons are the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.120 
just judging how hot the irons are the
iron<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:34.370> burn<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.610> I'm<00:03:36.000> able<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:37.130> just

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
iron is and I burn it I'm able to just

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.490 
iron is and I burn it I'm able to just
go<00:03:38.310> through<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.850> actually<00:03:39.690> we<00:03:40.110> braid<00:03:40.350> the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
go through and actually we braid the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.740 
go through and actually we braid the
hair<00:03:40.530> without<00:03:40.890> problems<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.940> not<00:03:42.420> having<00:03:42.600> a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
hair without problems and not having a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.270

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
big chunk of hair that I have to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.720 
big chunk of hair that I have to
rebreathe<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.500> wish<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:47.040> see<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.520> you<00:03:47.580> can

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
rebreathe so I wish you see if you can

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.860

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
way and I actually just found another

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.360 
way and I actually just found another
little<00:04:10.610> knot<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:12.379> was<00:04:12.560> at<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.799> end<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.220> one

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
little knot that was at the end of one

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.289 
little knot that was at the end of one
of<00:04:13.400> them<00:04:14.409> and<00:04:15.409> with<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.549> I'm<00:04:16.699> flattered<00:04:17.030> and

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
of them and with the I'm flattered and

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.830 
of them and with the I'm flattered and
then<00:04:17.479> I'll<00:04:17.600> just<00:04:17.780> take<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:18.079> off<00:04:19.570> it'll<00:04:20.570> catch

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
then I'll just take that off it'll catch

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:31.270 
then I'll just take that off it'll catch
it<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.199> take<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.530> right<00:04:21.680> off<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.979> feel

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
it and take it right off and feel

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.570 
it and take it right off and feel
another<00:04:31.550> one<00:04:31.760> in<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:31.970> hair<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:34.070> hopefully<00:04:34.520> it

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
another one in the hair so hopefully it

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:45.120 
another one in the hair so hopefully it
will<00:04:34.669> be

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.470 

again<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.460> something<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.910> can<00:04:47.120> do<00:04:47.300> you

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
again this is something you can do you

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.150 
again this is something you can do you
just<00:04:47.660> have<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.930> make<00:04:48.110> sure<00:04:48.140> you<00:04:48.470> don't<00:04:48.650> use<00:04:48.950> too

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
just have to make sure you don't use too

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.520 
just have to make sure you don't use too
much<00:04:49.190> heat<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.910> then<00:04:50.750> every<00:04:50.990> time<00:04:51.170> you<00:04:51.320> do<00:04:51.500> it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
much heat and then every time you do it

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.080 
much heat and then every time you do it
you<00:04:51.770> want<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:51.980> use<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.250> little<00:04:52.520> bit<00:04:52.580> less<00:04:52.640> heat

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
you want to use a little bit less heat

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.060 
you want to use a little bit less heat
because<00:04:53.810> remember<00:04:54.080> this<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.530> melting<00:04:54.980> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
because remember this is melting the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:06.179 
because remember this is melting the
hair<00:04:55.280> into<00:04:55.400> place

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.350 

we<00:05:06.969> just<00:05:07.149> do<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.330> on<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.599> ends<00:05:08.849> then<00:05:09.849> sometimes

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
we just do it on the ends then sometimes

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.729 
we just do it on the ends then sometimes
like<00:05:10.479> when<00:05:10.659> you<00:05:10.779> sleep<00:05:10.929> you<00:05:11.169> get<00:05:11.319> a<00:05:11.349> little<00:05:11.619> bit

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:11.739 
like when you sleep you get a little bit

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:13.409 
like when you sleep you get a little bit
of<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.889> crimp<00:05:12.159> in<00:05:12.279> your<00:05:12.339> hair<00:05:12.669> up<00:05:12.879> here

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
of a crimp in your hair up here

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.100 
of a crimp in your hair up here
I<00:05:13.679> had<00:05:14.679> one<00:05:14.889> up<00:05:15.009> here<00:05:15.309> and<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.849> did<00:05:16.149> like<00:05:16.389> put<00:05:17.080> a

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
I had one up here and I did like put a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.040 
I had one up here and I did like put a
very<00:05:17.739> very<00:05:18.129> very<00:05:18.369> cool<00:05:18.699> iron<00:05:19.029> on<00:05:19.449> it<00:05:19.629> just<00:05:19.899> to

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
very very very cool iron on it just to

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.799 
very very very cool iron on it just to
get<00:05:20.199> rid<00:05:20.349> of<00:05:20.409> that<00:05:20.649> kink<00:05:20.889> in<00:05:21.009> my<00:05:21.039> hair<00:05:21.399> and

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:21.809 
get rid of that kink in my hair and

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.679 
get rid of that kink in my hair and
because<00:05:22.809> I'm<00:05:23.050> certainly<00:05:23.800> not<00:05:23.919> trying<00:05:23.979> to

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
because I'm certainly not trying to

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.169 
because I'm certainly not trying to
flatter<00:05:25.689> my<00:05:26.050> hair<00:05:26.319> but<00:05:27.419> that's<00:05:28.419> that<00:05:28.749> then<00:05:30.179> put

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:31.179 
flatter my hair but that's that then put

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:35.489 
flatter my hair but that's that then put

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
it away for the next time I guess but

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:45.239 
it away for the next time I guess but
this<00:05:35.649> is<00:05:35.860> how<00:05:36.039> it<00:05:36.219> looks<00:05:43.679> pretty<00:05:44.679> they<00:05:45.069> did

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:45.249 
this is how it looks pretty they did

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:58.239 
this is how it looks pretty they did
such<00:05:45.699> a<00:05:45.729> good<00:05:46.119> job<00:05:46.179> I'm<00:05:46.869> just<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:47.229> excited
