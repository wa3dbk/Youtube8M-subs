00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.959 

hi<00:00:12.420> guys<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.860> today<00:00:14.160> we're<00:00:14.580> gonna<00:00:14.670> be<00:00:14.820> looking

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
hi guys and today we're gonna be looking

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.210 
hi guys and today we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:15.270> the<00:00:15.450> hardware<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.110> benchmark<00:00:16.590> scores<00:00:16.860> of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
at the hardware and benchmark scores of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.630 
at the hardware and benchmark scores of
the<00:00:17.670> swipe<00:00:18.210> phablet<00:00:18.750> f3<00:00:19.280> so<00:00:20.280> let's<00:00:20.460> quickly

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the swipe phablet f3 so let's quickly

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
the swipe phablet f3 so let's quickly
jump<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.119> quadrant<00:00:21.630> standard<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
jump into quadrant standard and see the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.420 
jump into quadrant standard and see the
hardware<00:00:22.800> specifications<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.730> device<00:00:23.970> so

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
hardware specifications of the device so

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.990 
hardware specifications of the device so
as<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.700> it<00:00:26.970> 100<00:00:27.540> 4.1.1<00:00:28.470> jelly<00:00:28.500> bean

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
as you can see it 100 4.1.1 jelly bean

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.630 
as you can see it 100 4.1.1 jelly bean
comes<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.180> a<00:00:30.210> 1<00:00:30.690> gigahertz<00:00:30.900> dual-core<00:00:31.640> armv7

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
comes with a 1 gigahertz dual-core armv7

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.619 
comes with a 1 gigahertz dual-core armv7
processor<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.870> swipe<00:00:34.800> lists<00:00:35.309> 512<00:00:36.180> mb<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.539> ram

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
processor and swipe lists 512 mb of ram

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.800 
processor and swipe lists 512 mb of ram
but<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.440> shows<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.770> about<00:00:38.329> 475<00:00:39.329> mb<00:00:39.720> of

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
but here it shows just about 475 mb of

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.100 
but here it shows just about 475 mb of
ram<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> device<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> let's<00:00:42.660> run<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.900> full

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
ram on the device so let's run the full

00:00:43.110 --> 00:01:09.370 
ram on the device so let's run the full
benchmark<00:00:43.620> test

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.440 

so<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> device<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.009> tu-95<00:01:11.850> three<00:01:12.090> points

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so the device first tu-95 three points

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.080 
so the device first tu-95 three points
in<00:01:12.630> quadrant<00:01:13.080> standard<00:01:13.490> which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.640> quite<00:01:15.060> good

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in quadrant standard which is quite good

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
in quadrant standard which is quite good
and<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> placed<00:01:16.080> above<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> Samsung

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and it is placed above the Samsung

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.370 
and it is placed above the Samsung
Galaxy<00:01:17.520> Tab<00:01:17.700> 10.1<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.540> well<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> Galaxy

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well as the Galaxy

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well as the Galaxy
Nexus<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.330> let's<00:01:21.630> turn<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.229> Bank

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
Nexus so now let's turn on to do Bank

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
Nexus so now let's turn on to do Bank
box<00:01:22.710> under<00:01:22.979> device

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.280 

finally<00:01:52.490> after<00:01:52.610> taking<00:01:52.939> ages<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.540> complete<00:01:53.899> we

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
finally after taking ages to complete we

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.630 
finally after taking ages to complete we
have<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.500> score<00:01:54.799> of<00:01:54.829> seven<00:01:55.280> thousand<00:01:55.610> one

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
have a score of seven thousand one

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.760 
have a score of seven thousand one
hundred<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.210> eleven<00:01:56.329> points<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.320> Andrew

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
hundred and eleven points on the Andrew

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:23.960 
hundred and eleven points on the Andrew
benchmarks<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.040> time<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.460> run<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:01.850> AMA<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.750 

so<00:02:24.970> we<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.239> an<00:02:25.360> enema<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.870> score<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.290> 27.53<00:02:27.250> s

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
so we have an enema to score of 27.53 s

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.320 
so we have an enema to score of 27.53 s
on<00:02:27.970> these<00:02:28.209> swipe<00:02:28.480> phablet<00:02:28.989> f3<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.730> finally

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
on these swipe phablet f3 and finally

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:42.300 
on these swipe phablet f3 and finally
now<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> time<00:02:32.049> for<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.349> modulus<00:02:33.069> benchmarks

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.860 

as<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.490> can<00:02:43.580> see<00:02:43.730> we<00:02:44.000> have<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> five-point

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
as you can see we have a five-point

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.960 
as you can see we have a five-point
might<00:02:45.140> touch<00:02:45.350> screen<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.890> device<00:02:46.130> there

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
might touch screen on the device there

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.550 
might touch screen on the device there
you<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:47.300> guys<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.690> was<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.960> hardware<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
you go guys this was the hardware and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.210 
you go guys this was the hardware and
benchmark<00:02:49.040> tests<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.730> swipe<00:02:50.150> phablet<00:02:50.630> f3

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
benchmark tests on the swipe phablet f3

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.170 
benchmark tests on the swipe phablet f3
