00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
it up I like it I think it gives you a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.080 
it up I like it I think it gives you a
level<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.689> style<00:00:30.960> dimension<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.850> fact

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
level of style dimension and the fact

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.670 
level of style dimension and the fact
that<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> deeper<00:00:34.110> meaning<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.469> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that there is a deeper meaning to it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
that there is a deeper meaning to it
makes<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> much<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.300> appealing

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
makes it that much more appealing
