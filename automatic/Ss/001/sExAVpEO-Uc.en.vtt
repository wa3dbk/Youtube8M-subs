00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.109
 I am going to hear rumors 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.929
 Internet views that there may be one 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.570
 iphone 6 is coming 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.549
 yes not on very short mine but that it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 home plan and they more or less oil 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.830
 Runs the iphones one when I 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.020
 understood a little bit and copropagation yes that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
 probably just an iphone 6s 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 so it's not quite yet 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.869
 clearly 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.779
 I find it plausible now 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 Thumbs comes with apple 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 relying lands products works 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.520
 within a product group 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.590
 a long time ago that was unthinkable 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.969
 that they just put the iphone around them 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.350
 then about that shit 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149
 and then it was just when you got one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.910
 phone him from apple then you have it 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.039
 it takes older but do they 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.489
 are going to split 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.500
 well now we have a 6s plus 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.430
 naturally comes the well-known 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.070
 update for those not the big ups on the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.239
 updating is just what had to go from 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.780
 the five to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.189
 first yes the 5s and then compass 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 the six so the will first have an update 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.840
 out of six, 5s and 5s plus 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.650
 So lay ss yes and jaw not so 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.439
 yummy 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 sss sss 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 no yes i want an iphone 6s 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 yes it should say so, and it was suddenly 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.900
 want yes it is nice to have the iphone 6s yes 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.659
 i think he will i this is it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.490
 saw but I go there 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.770
 no i think whatever you like a little bit now 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.360
 read it who would then pass for me all 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
 what really notorious together for the year 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 then his works is that this year is coming 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 just as the year after that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.840
 possibly those there and those just like the de 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.680
 ipad and the macbook 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 yes , his first job is very thin 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.470
 had to think about it 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.869
 you don't hear much of it then I thought 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.909
 also quite senseless but the couple 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.590
 curved iphones that were there 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.810
 I'm very curious how it goes me 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.670
 Phones became paper thin as a year 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.799
 sure don't bend it's no more 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.020
 then this year is a bit what 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.460
 material used but yes so that is 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.110
 the logical consequence of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.369
 and not only that but i think i am 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.929
 do n't just take his phones out 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.120
 enough by now 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.760
 I saw it extra strong 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.130
 seriously my saw me yes and whole 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.630
 what we how much do you want this is and for that 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.140
 for me this is not the thinnest phone either 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.620
 is more 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.180
 no may really be thin about not at the expense 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.650
 of that firmness is the thing i want 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.000
 I have the feeling something and my hands 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.170
 something in my hands and not it either 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.110
 feeling I carry something in my pants 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.330
 owning and that they are quite the kit 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.470
 could be better but just yeah this is it 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.650
 a little double 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.030
 that there would be that iphone would be very 4-inch 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.430
 so we're going back one step 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.340
 screen will continue as normal 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.230
 high end so I don't believe anything at all 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.090
 of the entire messages to my for the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.580
 They then tide a movie with what just 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.290
 man sit comfortably 3d studio this you 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.780
 this post lived as a designer 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.190
 overcast apple music 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.870
 I also think because it's just one 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.930
 iphone s in design 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.269
 only then a bit thinner and 4 inch 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.739
 no but that is but that is not a that 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.480
 that work but follower would do it higher 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.519
 in the next iphone is going to become thinner 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.900
 yes that 's not so that's one that's it 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.519
 me but that they are for the very branding 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 go that yes I do not know either 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.680
 i would love to have their iphone there 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.510
 why because they are very sorry afterwards 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.900
 wide range of say the iphone 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.549
 name is 1000 times stronger than there 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.859
 yes everyone knows iphone and wifi 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.959
 Deputy nobody was rich 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.030
 there is that now for two generations 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.130
 with the ipad it is that you know they already 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.440
 on it is all under iphone what 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.299
 regards yes mark the images that and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.380
 brand awareness yes so I don't see it that way 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.750
 good why he wouldn't mind 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.549
 add what what what it adds to you 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.989
 for you but good there too 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.790
 little apple has been doing it lately 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.160
 just running out of weird stuff that would bother me 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.709
 nothing surprising that the flowers were there 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.139
 ipad also completely unnecessary so therefore 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.370
 me but they just try them 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.190
 tries a little bit right 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.360
 suggest little premium on the de 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.060
 more expensive 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.830
 because yes ipad air 2 is the coolest ipad 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.920
 everyone is yes 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.520
 so what you and that they prefer it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.110
 do that instead of a 5 and 5c 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.240
 do you know they just say yes the 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.370
 iphone and the iphone there all your like that 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.660
 small cabinet screen is going to be natural 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.330
 not the flagship because it is then 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.519
 so you know 6 industry is 7 modules 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.100
 ef piece was already here in the macbook air's 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.960
 on the smaller macbook is your 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.910
 and that sentence in that sense cider in small 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.940
 kind of logical that they do one 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.130
 cases 7 are going to bring out, and then the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.440
 iphone 7 is just the plus and therefore fast 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.860
 plus go off and then you also have 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.460
 just the iphone 7 and that's small 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.140
 but make that end of day on which 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.380
 area to you you know what how the fuck 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.540
 cares if the iphone air is you well me 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.140
 we think a lot of apple users and 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.060
 lovers 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.100
 yes but yes 9 years maybe I am 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.780
 just a little i want the other 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.050
 case very interesting that the following 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.879
 ipad 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.770
 pressure are pin that added 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.300
 get that i think that's my pathetic 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.580
 yes yes there you have something to that 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.169
 can anyone give me what you need next 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.620
 be it the iPhone is the iPhone 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.659
 is you know i can't quite stand there 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.240
 very busy 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.590
 well we are going to experience it I think 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.090
 that they still best go to the 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.740
 might find the iphone but this 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.909
 specific movie doesn't seem like that 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.479
 very 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.479
 not very authentic
