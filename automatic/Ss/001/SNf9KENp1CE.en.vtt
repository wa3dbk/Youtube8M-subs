stuff too warm to open on the engine
until<00:05:11.780> they<00:05:12.050> reach<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.350> certain<00:05:12.380> temperature

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
until they reach a certain temperature

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.280 
until they reach a certain temperature
and<00:05:13.610> until<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.120> thermostat<00:05:14.660> open<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.110> water

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
and until the thermostat open the water

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.250 
and until the thermostat open the water
is<00:05:15.500> not<00:05:15.620> circulated<00:05:16.220> everywhere<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.960> you<00:05:18.020> want

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
is not circulated everywhere so you want

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.780 
is not circulated everywhere so you want
to<00:05:18.380> add<00:05:18.500> those<00:05:18.710> open<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.340> recording<00:05:19.760> to

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
to add those open to the recording to

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.180 
to add those open to the recording to
all<00:05:20.030> there<00:05:20.390> is<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:21.350> they<00:05:21.560> need<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.710> get<00:05:21.920> warm

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
all there is so they need to get warm

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.190 
all there is so they need to get warm
but<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.850> think<00:05:23.090> right<00:05:23.420> now<00:05:23.630> that<00:05:23.660> there<00:05:24.110> would

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
but I think right now that there would

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.910 
but I think right now that there would
have<00:05:24.260> been<00:05:24.350> warm<00:05:24.710> already<00:05:24.920> so<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:26.810> is<00:05:27.110> for<00:05:27.620> them

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
have been warm already so it is for them

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.950 
have been warm already so it is for them
but<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.490> don't<00:05:28.700> want<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:29.000> just<00:05:29.150> do<00:05:29.360> two

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
but you don't want to just do two

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.800 
but you don't want to just do two
minutes<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.440> want<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.740> do

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:59.250
