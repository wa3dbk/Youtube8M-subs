also<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.720> flying<00:02:33.230> jump<00:02:33.680> or<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.460> which<00:02:34.820> I'm

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
also have flying jump or and which I'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.470 
also have flying jump or and which I'm
sure<00:02:35.960> what<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.230> does<00:02:39.820> okay<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.850> have<00:02:41.030> no<00:02:41.180> idea

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
sure what that does okay I have no idea

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.710 
sure what that does okay I have no idea
what<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.020> does<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.270> guess<00:02:44.270> it<00:02:44.420> maybe<00:02:44.600> it

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
what that does but I guess it maybe it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.030 
what that does but I guess it maybe it
makes<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.020> little<00:02:45.200> bit<00:02:45.290> more<00:02:45.410> easier<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.860> jump

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
makes a little bit more easier to jump

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.310 
makes a little bit more easier to jump
between<00:02:46.160> two<00:02:46.520> points<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.120> will<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:47.780> also<00:02:48.020> have

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
between two points I will then also have

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.350 
between two points I will then also have
the<00:02:48.470> unlimited<00:02:48.830> fixed<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.760> limited<00:02:50.150> which

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
the unlimited fixed and limited which

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.330 
the unlimited fixed and limited which
means<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.930> as<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.710> see<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:51.980> unlimited

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
means that as you see I have unlimited

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.520 
means that as you see I have unlimited
here<00:02:52.910> which<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.390> these<00:02:53.600> little<00:02:53.840> bars<00:02:54.080> down

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
here which is these little bars down

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.410 
here which is these little bars down
here<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.640> these<00:02:56.450> little<00:02:56.690> feet<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.890> was<00:02:58.190> to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
here of these little feet so if I was to

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.360 
here of these little feet so if I was to
stick<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.660> on<00:02:59.900> limited<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.860> can<00:03:01.010> see<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.160> only

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
stick that on limited you can see I only

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.120 
stick that on limited you can see I only
have<00:03:01.580> free<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.570> that'd<00:03:02.720> be<00:03:02.840> one<00:03:03.050> two<00:03:03.380> three<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
have free so that'd be one two three and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.800 
have free so that'd be one two three and
then<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:04.459> out<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.970> I'm<00:03:05.420> going<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.630> end<00:03:05.720> up
