whereas previous projects have all been

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.889 
whereas previous projects have all been
about<00:01:00.480> moving<00:01:01.440> people<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.579> better<00:01:03.059> area<00:01:03.600> or

about moving people to a better area or

about moving people to a better area or
to<00:01:04.080> prefabricated<00:01:04.650> housing<00:01:06.290> because<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.650> of

to prefabricated housing because one of

the advantages if you take an existing

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.760 
the advantages if you take an existing
slum<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.240> land<00:01:12.570> rate<00:01:12.869> issues<00:01:13.439> have

slum is the land rate issues have
already<00:01:13.890> been<00:01:14.189> resolved<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
already been resolved that there is a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.260 
already been resolved that there is a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
structure that is there all that we now

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.990 
structure that is there all that we now
need<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> regenerate<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> slum<00:01:20.520> we

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
need to do is to regenerate that slum we

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.359 
need to do is to regenerate that slum we
are<00:01:21.090> also<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.960> talking<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.500> house

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
are also not just talking about house

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.050 
are also not just talking about house
house<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.570> simply<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> metaphor<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:26.759> can

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
house to me is simply a metaphor it can

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.410 
house to me is simply a metaphor it can
solve<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.840> interlocking<00:01:28.560> set<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.100> problems

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
solve an interlocking set of problems

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.899 
solve an interlocking set of problems
for<00:01:30.420> instance<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.860> goes<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.369> slum

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
for instance when one goes to a slum

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.480 
for instance when one goes to a slum
because<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.110> no<00:01:34.350> facility<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.220> shower

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because there is no facility for shower

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
because there is no facility for shower
inside<00:01:36.060> typically<00:01:36.840> people<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:37.950> shower

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
inside typically people take shower

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.300 
inside typically people take shower
outside<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.439> only<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.710> privacy

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
outside and this is not only a privacy

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.530 
outside and this is not only a privacy
issue<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.850> also<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.150> health<00:01:42.360> issue

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
issue but it's also a health issue

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.289 
issue but it's also a health issue
because<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.680> dirty<00:01:43.920> water<00:01:44.250> gets<00:01:44.640> thrown

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
because the dirty water gets thrown

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.080 
because the dirty water gets thrown
there<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.290> proper<00:01:46.710> sanitation<00:01:47.250> because

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there is no proper sanitation because

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.760 
there is no proper sanitation because
there<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> no<00:01:48.720> school<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.290> no<00:01:49.320> education

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
there is no school there is no education

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.990 
there is no school there is no education
therefore<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.450> thinking<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
therefore what we are thinking of is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
therefore what we are thinking of is
regenerating<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.030> slum<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> point<00:01:55.320> where

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
regenerating the slum to a point where

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.459 
regenerating the slum to a point where
we<00:01:55.829> provide<00:01:56.250> health<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:57.240> provide<00:01:57.659> education

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
we provide health we provide education

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.880 
we provide health we provide education
we<00:01:58.890> provide<00:01:59.340> water<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.360> provide<00:02:00.780> energy<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
we provide water we provide energy and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.039 
we provide water we provide energy and
we<00:02:02.729> also<00:02:02.909> give<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.509> sense<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.840> dignity

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
we also give them a sense of dignity

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.690 
we also give them a sense of dignity

that's right fantastic how are you gonna

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.949 
that's right fantastic how are you gonna
use<00:02:45.100> local<00:02:45.580> materials<00:02:45.610> though<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.810> is

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
use local materials though if this is

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.630 
use local materials though if this is
thought<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.530> one<00:02:47.739> part<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.160> world<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
thought of in one part of the world and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.320 
thought of in one part of the world and
being<00:02:48.819> built<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.269> another<00:02:49.540> part<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.850> need<00:02:52.090> to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
being built in another part we need to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.410 
being built in another part we need to
first<00:02:52.600> understand<00:02:53.200> what<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.400> customer<00:02:54.940> wants

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
first understand what the customer wants

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.120 
first understand what the customer wants
in<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.840> house<00:02:55.989> because<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.680> customer

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
in the house because the customer

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.210 
in the house because the customer
problem<00:02:57.670> has<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> starting<00:02:59.019> point<00:02:59.380> by

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
problem has to be the starting point by

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.120 
problem has to be the starting point by
customer<00:03:00.730> problem<00:03:01.180> what<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:01.360> mean<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.920> you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
customer problem what I mean is if you

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.420 
customer problem what I mean is if you
go<00:03:03.280> into<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.610> slum<00:03:04.030> look<00:03:04.660> at<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> house<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:06.280> is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
go into a slum look at a house there is

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.380 
go into a slum look at a house there is
no<00:03:06.610> ventilation

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
no ventilation

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.420 
no ventilation
therefore<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.170> pitch<00:03:08.530> dark<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.310> no

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
therefore it is pitch dark there is no

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.280 
therefore it is pitch dark there is no
sunlight<00:03:09.670> there<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.599> if<00:03:10.959> there<00:03:11.110> was<00:03:11.170> no

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
sunlight there and if there was no

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.839 
sunlight there and if there was no
electricity<00:03:11.650> they<00:03:12.010> are<00:03:12.069> living<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.430> darkness

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
electricity they are living in darkness

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.030 
electricity they are living in darkness
24/7<00:03:13.690> then<00:03:14.260> because<00:03:14.650> there<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:14.890> no

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
24/7 then because there is no

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.280 
24/7 then because there is no
ventilation<00:03:15.760> there<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.420> no<00:03:16.569> air<00:03:16.750> circulation

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
ventilation there is no air circulation

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.130 
ventilation there is no air circulation
there<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.160> sanitation<00:03:18.880> problems<00:03:19.359> so<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.959> need

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
there is sanitation problems so we need

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.599 
there is sanitation problems so we need
to<00:03:20.260> first<00:03:20.440> understand<00:03:20.920> what<00:03:20.980> their<00:03:21.310> issues

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
to first understand what their issues

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.910 
to first understand what their issues
are<00:03:21.640> then<00:03:22.540> we<00:03:22.780> need<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.140> design<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.769> house

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
are then we need to design the house

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.060 
are then we need to design the house
design<00:03:24.510> requires<00:03:25.510> layout<00:03:26.019> understanding<00:03:26.950> how

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
design requires layout understanding how

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.610 
design requires layout understanding how
the<00:03:27.370> comes<00:03:27.579> house<00:03:27.820> should<00:03:28.060> be<00:03:28.239> laid<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.780> then

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the comes house should be laid out then

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.500 
the comes house should be laid out then
we<00:03:29.859> worry<00:03:30.069> about<00:03:30.160> materials<00:03:30.970> what<00:03:31.239> kind<00:03:31.450> of

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
we worry about materials what kind of

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.539 
we worry about materials what kind of
materials<00:03:31.989> we<00:03:32.140> can<00:03:32.290> use<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:33.040> stay<00:03:33.250> within<00:03:33.430> that

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
materials we can use to stay within that

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.190 
materials we can use to stay within that
price<00:03:33.880> point<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.329> three<00:03:34.450> hundred<00:03:34.720> dollars<00:03:35.019> and

price point of three hundred dollars and

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.979 
price point of three hundred dollars and
the<00:03:35.859> materials<00:03:36.459> will<00:03:36.549> be<00:03:36.730> very<00:03:36.910> local<00:03:37.420> the

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
the materials will be very local the

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.930 
the materials will be very local the
material<00:03:38.470> we<00:03:38.620> use<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.980> Haiti<00:03:39.220> may<00:03:39.880> be

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
material we use in Haiti may be

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.849 
material we use in Haiti may be
different<00:03:40.450> from<00:03:40.750> what<00:03:40.989> we<00:03:41.140> use<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.470> Brazil
