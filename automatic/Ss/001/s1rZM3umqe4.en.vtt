00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.169
 it's 1 to the fact that they are located 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.330

 cursed sanctuaries it's about breaker 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.670
 of curse two holds sums 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.420

 little trick to find them the most 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.170
 quickly possible the trick lies in 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.010
 launching a game in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.020

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.340
 adventure you must have beforehand

 simply to move your mouse 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.100
 on the exclamation point to see if 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.840

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.399
