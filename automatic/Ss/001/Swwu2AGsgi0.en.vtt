when I'm working on a project or an
album<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.600> try<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.079> consistency<00:02:07.649> from

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
album I try and get consistency from

track<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> track<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> things<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
track to track and one of the things I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.270 
track to track and one of the things I
try<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.590> leave<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.799> bass<00:02:11.069> amp

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

try and do is leave the bass amp
settings<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.790> same<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.379> exactly

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
settings the same so this is exactly

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.020 
settings the same so this is exactly
where<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.069> was<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> was<00:02:14.760> playing<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
where it was when I was playing the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:30.550 
where it was when I was playing the
tobias<00:02:15.299> so<00:02:15.690> let's<00:02:15.870> check<00:02:16.049> out<00:02:16.170> some<00:02:16.200> fretless

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.330 

and<00:02:31.560> here's<00:02:31.739> something<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.099> little<00:02:32.310> more

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and here's something a little more

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:44.970 
and here's something a little more
sensitive

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.530 

all<00:02:45.980> right<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.430> let's<00:02:46.610> check<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> effects

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
all right so let's check out the effects

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.930 
all right so let's check out the effects
so<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> first<00:02:48.800> effect<00:02:49.130> I'm<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.430> add<00:02:49.550> is

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
so the first effect I'm going to add is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.449 
so the first effect I'm going to add is
an<00:02:50.090> even<00:02:50.390> tide<00:02:50.600> time<00:02:51.200> factor<00:02:51.740> in<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.130> effects

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
an even tide time factor in the effects

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:10.240 
an even tide time factor in the effects
loop<00:03:06.820> nice<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:09.320> now<00:03:09.470> I'm<00:03:09.590> going<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.800> add<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
loop nice so now I'm going to add the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:26.920 
loop nice so now I'm going to add the
