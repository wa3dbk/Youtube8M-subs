00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.000
 when we listen we elect all this information we remain astonished we remain 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 breathless 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.489
 the first question we ask ourselves is 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:11.219
 I became crazy 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.779
 I'm imagining all these things 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.050
 I would like to reassure those who feel this way 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.390
 you are not crazy 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.239
 you don't have the traveggole 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.460
 the shutters of your awareness are opening and when this happens 

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:26.689
 what we see as unreal 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.869
 for example in 2012 the Americans are burying their dead like 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 they did during the American civil war 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.030
 they were thousands then they will be tens of thousands in the future 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.580
 but this was the powerless time the government was not so used to managing 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.580
 such situations 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.000
 we would like our governments to be able to save us all but we must 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 be practical and realistic 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 there are not enough resources to save everyone 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.170
 many will be left to themselves because our governments have a commitment 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.770
 precise which consists in ensuring the survival of our species 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.350
 this is the main objective 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.000
 one thing needs to be understood quickly 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.439
 that is, the way in which planet x interacts with our sun 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.610
 as the planet approaches the point closest to our sun 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.270
 there will be a cosmic duel of electromagnetic force that lasts from several 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 months 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.720
 in that moment our beautiful planet will be hit by numerous 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 solar storms and cosmic lightning 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.910
 in the kolbrin bible the Egyptians warn us that we will have so much 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 dread that women will be serious men in underwear 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.970
 the whole humanity foolish killer 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.240
 these governments of ours are spinning right now 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.480
 industrialized vicovaro. 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.810
 photo 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.070
 they are working anciently to launch a large fleet of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 observers know vain in the torrent space 2011 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.320
 it is the first time that there is this sense of urgency in the history of the world there 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 they were days of the blackbird 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.849
 many of these observers are already in operation will help in our governments a 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.349
 signaling the world is the man to find ways to defend himself from 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
 metal violence solar storm radiation 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.719
 how are you using yourself 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.829
 lime tree space people not understood by the instruments used in a telescope 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:31.749
 abarth 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.299
 the state used for purposes other than those for which it was built 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.049
 however these objects in orbit can be hit in their world of 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.119
 solar storms 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.119
 but fortunately our governments have anobii 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.639
 in 2007 a giant telescope in the Alessandria-based base on Monday 28th 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.559
 finally operational 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.259
 America in a very short time spent a huge amount to install this 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.069
 large infrared ray telescope - - 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.839
 so that it can report keynes in southern hemisphere boards 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.799
 kidney pain 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.519
 this tool is the ideal vehicle at the right time in the right place 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.739
 now the time will probably come when those who have been chosen me 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.789
 I explain better to be saved 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.099
 zalando evacuated taken via rss urine analysis 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.120
 these are like acacias will survive are 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.680
 no choices have been made by the armies and governments they will have 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 the role of ensuring the continuity of his we had to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.409
 second only 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.409
 do not wash turin 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.249
 obviously many survival doctors will work 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.249
 synonymous will be much more important than sensitive people 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.349
 and then we need a new generation of people scientists 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.349
 highly qualified inverted hyndai holy general 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.659
 many of these people will not know they have been chosen until they come 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.209
 away from the hour I eat 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.720
 now that there won't be enough space resources for a maximum keep alive 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720
 both them and their family 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.159
 it's painful 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.180
 those who will leave their loved ones to survive will sense 

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:34.479
 of joy in their hearts 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.800
 while those who will be taken away will feel a great sense of 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 oppression for this new great responsibility 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.189
 those courage will be accepted 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.759
 for those left alone and themselves there will be fear panic 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.850
 in 2012 we will not learn that people who think rigidly though 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.850
 will survive will not be very phages 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.960
 in the first two tests the first people will be the ones to surrender to theirs 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.180
 destiny 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.699
 those who will think that the chaos that follows will be the perfect casione for 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.220
 taking advantage of personal advantages were a nasty surprise 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.380
 the American military will be recalled from overseas operations was in the 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.819
 task of dealing with the application of the rules of martial laws 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.870
 anywhere in the country 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.360
 those who are used to manipulating the legal system will find themselves in one 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.480
 new situation 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.599
 they cannot risk being outside the law 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.770
 those who decide to behave illegally on the veranda confront each other 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.169
 with immediate and brutal methods 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.699
 it will be in this way that the possibility of going ahead will be guaranteed 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.919
 live civilly 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.020
 many pack up with everything I own 9 with their supplies 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.689
 they will escape from the cities 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.199
 this land ken where the roads will be practicable because there will be me 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.949
 single cars and natural disasters 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.759
 however given the immense scope of the events there will be no guarantees for 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.449
 those chosen by their governments to survive 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.289
 mmo for those who defend themselves will seek solutions on their own 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:10.269
 but there are and will be people prepared to save themselves long before 

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:13.110
 how much will be discussed of all this 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.860
 so when those times come they will be ready and they will know how it turns 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.860
 quietly quickly 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.439
 they will meet with other small groups where service for others will be 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.439
 the rule is not the exception 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.409
 and you will understand that the planet is flat survival and dealing with that 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.869
 that there is in their heart and rather than with the solidity of their bunka 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
 he said he could give very rightly 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.919
 luck helps the prepared mind 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.979
 the penis forecast book 3x6 guide for survival in 2012 published by 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.499
 academy for the Italian edition 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.049
 I offer a practical strategy useful information for those who want 

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:03.579
 walking on this path is only one main purpose 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.319
 i want to become a new york time home 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.430
 massage and breakfast course will leave us voice in mind 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.349
 the matches will have survived thanks to their philosophy of service of the 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:19.159
 others 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:24.080
 they will rise from the ruins will be staged with passion lemon and mint 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.899
 tolerance and above all not 

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:30.879
 because the greatness of this time will witness the marvelous of 

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.289
 birth of the new world 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:33.949
 how will it be
