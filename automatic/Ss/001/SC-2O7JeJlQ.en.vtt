does<00:01:19.110> enhance<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.920> student's<00:01:19.979> experience<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
does enhance a student's experience and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
does enhance a student's experience and
an<00:01:22.140> important<00:01:22.500> role<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.680> schools<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
an important role in schools is the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.000 
an important role in schools is the
social<00:01:24.270> development<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> child<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
social development of a child and the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.710 
social development of a child and the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
whole development of a child and I think

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560 
whole development of a child and I think
