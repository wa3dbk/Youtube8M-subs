the spirits of evil can bring this
monster<00:01:50.219> down<00:01:50.399> perhaps<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.240> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
monster down perhaps this is that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.209 
monster down perhaps this is that
pumpkin<00:01:51.719> there's<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:52.679> to<00:01:52.740> find<00:01:53.009> out

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
is basically a mine so I'm going to pop

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.260 
is basically a mine so I'm going to pop
that<00:01:59.759> their<00:02:00.329> ethics<00:02:01.249> so<00:02:02.249> that's<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.090> an
