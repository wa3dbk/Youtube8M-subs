00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
time to let it dry which probably be

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.210 
time to let it dry which probably be
like<00:01:40.170> 30<00:01:40.380> minutes<00:01:41.240> or<00:01:42.240> getting<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.259> tissue<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
gonna get on it I haven't like I've
noticed<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.060> t-shirts<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> stuff

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
noticed I like on my t-shirts and stuff

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
noticed I like on my t-shirts and stuff
when<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
when I was just like when I got it in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.330 
when I was just like when I got it in
playing<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.020> stuff<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.070> don't

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
playing with that and stuff but I don't

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
playing with that and stuff but I don't
think<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.610> stained<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:04.079> my<00:02:04.200> t-shirt<00:02:04.409> or

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
think it's stained it like my t-shirt or

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.340 
think it's stained it like my t-shirt or
anything<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> might<00:02:06.200> depending<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
anything but it might depending on the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.010 
anything but it might depending on the
fabric<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.890> might<00:02:08.099> stain<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.929> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
fabric it might stain it so just a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.260 
fabric it might stain it so just a
little<00:02:10.229> FYI

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
little FYI

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.970 
little FYI
be<00:02:12.110> careful<00:02:12.440> with<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:12.740> you

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
be careful with it because you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.580 
be careful with it because you
definitely<00:02:13.220> don't<00:02:13.490> want<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.730> ruin<00:02:13.910> your

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
definitely don't want to ruin your

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.260 
definitely don't want to ruin your
outfit<00:02:15.590> or<00:02:15.800> look<00:02:16.160> ridiculous<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:17.000> public

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
outfit or look ridiculous in public

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.330 
outfit or look ridiculous in public
because<00:02:17.540> you've<00:02:17.690> got<00:02:17.840> bronze<00:02:18.380> patches<00:02:19.160> all

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
because you've got bronze patches all

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.190 
because you've got bronze patches all
over<00:02:19.520> your<00:02:19.670> clothes<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.540> other<00:02:20.780> than<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.080> I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
over your clothes but other than that I

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.300 
over your clothes but other than that I
mean<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.470> think<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.680> really<00:02:21.860> doesn't<00:02:22.100> give<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
mean I think it really doesn't give you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.760 
mean I think it really doesn't give you
a<00:02:22.340> nice<00:02:22.580> look<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.180> nice<00:02:23.720> Sheen<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.620> wish

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
a nice look is a nice Sheen to it I wish

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.890 
a nice look is a nice Sheen to it I wish
it<00:02:24.920> would<00:02:25.040> if<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.000> stick<00:02:26.180> closer<00:02:26.600> there<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.320> go

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
it would if I stick closer there you go

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.440 
it would if I stick closer there you go
but<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:31.490> definitely<00:02:31.880> gives<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.240> nice

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
but it definitely gives you a nice

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.650 
but it definitely gives you a nice
bronze<00:02:33.110> look<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.920> smells<00:02:34.160> amazing<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.150> I

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
bronze look and it smells amazing and I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.630 
bronze look and it smells amazing and I
a<00:02:35.960> little<00:02:36.350> goes<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> long<00:02:36.680> way<00:02:36.980> with<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.610> I
