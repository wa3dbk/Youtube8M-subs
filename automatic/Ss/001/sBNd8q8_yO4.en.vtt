so I hope that's as if that happens the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.500 
so I hope that's as if that happens the
one<00:01:50.400> thing<00:01:50.550> that<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:50.880> we'll<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.300> at<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
one thing that I think we'll see at the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.420 
one thing that I think we'll see at the
Oscars<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> cutouts<00:01:52.950> or
