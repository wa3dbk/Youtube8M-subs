okay<00:00:00.810> we<00:00:00.989> are<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.589> review<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.190> Hornet

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay we are going to review the Hornet

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.220 
okay we are going to review the Hornet
II<00:00:03.230> SST<00:00:04.230> bullet<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.400> particular<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:07.400> the

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
II SST bullet this particular one is the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.930 
II SST bullet this particular one is the
225<00:00:10.230> grain<00:00:12.349> 338<00:00:14.059> diameter<00:00:16.220> so<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.730> going

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
225 grain 338 diameter so we are going

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.920 
225 grain 338 diameter so we are going
to<00:00:18.180> shoot<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> into<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.170> water<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.660> see<00:00:21.660> how

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
to shoot it into some water and see how

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:36.070 
to shoot it into some water and see how
it<00:00:22.050> deforms

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.860 

so<00:00:37.080> here<00:00:37.650> is<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:38.040> before<00:00:38.310> and<00:00:38.670> after<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so here is the before and after the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.240 
so here is the before and after the
before<00:00:40.170> bullet<00:00:40.770> weighs<00:00:41.390> 225<00:00:42.390> grains<00:00:43.250> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
before bullet weighs 225 grains the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
before bullet weighs 225 grains the
bullet<00:00:44.790> after<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.510> shot<00:00:45.780> through<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> milk

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
bullet after was shot through the milk

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.680 
bullet after was shot through the milk
jugs<00:00:46.710> weighed<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.730> hundred<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.360> twenty-three

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
jugs weighed a hundred and twenty-three

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
jugs weighed a hundred and twenty-three
point<00:00:49.110> three<00:00:49.260> grains<00:00:51.470> as<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:53.220> can<00:00:53.400> see<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
point three grains as you can see the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.000 
point three grains as you can see the
copper<00:00:54.930> held<00:00:55.320> together<00:00:55.650> well<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.860> lead

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
copper held together well the lead

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.470 
copper held together well the lead
because<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.040> weighs<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.700> came<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.360> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
because I weighs more came out of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.180 
because I weighs more came out of the
copper<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.550> bullet<00:01:05.910> went<00:01:06.119> through<00:01:06.240> five

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
copper is the bullet went through five

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.740 
copper is the bullet went through five
to<00:01:08.190> gallon<00:01:08.610> two<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> half<00:01:09.149> gallon<00:01:09.509> milk

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to gallon two and a half gallon milk

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.800 
to gallon two and a half gallon milk
jugs<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:12.440> pierced<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.610> sixth<00:01:15.149> but<00:01:15.450> did<00:01:15.660> not

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
jugs and pierced the sixth but did not

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
jugs and pierced the sixth but did not
enter<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> after<00:01:19.640> we're<00:01:20.640> reviewing<00:01:20.910> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
enter it so after we're reviewing this

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
enter it so after we're reviewing this
I'm<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:22.440> sure<00:01:22.680> how<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> stacks<00:01:23.399> up<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> other

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I'm not sure how that stacks up to other

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.590 
I'm not sure how that stacks up to other
bullets<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:29.460> expansion<00:01:30.179> is<00:01:30.330> really

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
bullets but the the expansion is really

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
bullets but the the expansion is really
good<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:30.869> these<00:01:31.020> bullets<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.429> see<00:01:32.819> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
good with these bullets you can see the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.290 
good with these bullets you can see the
milk<00:01:33.330> jugs<00:01:33.630> explode<00:01:34.550> because<00:01:35.550> of<00:01:35.819> the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
milk jugs explode because of the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.960 
milk jugs explode because of the
pressure<00:01:37.220> because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.459> a<00:01:38.490> high<00:01:38.729> caliber

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pressure because it is a high caliber

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.070 
pressure because it is a high caliber
round<00:01:39.560> but<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.399> expand<00:01:42.119> fairly

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
round but and they do expand fairly

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.330 
round but and they do expand fairly
quickly<00:01:43.319> because<00:01:44.069> of<00:01:44.520> these<00:01:45.709> ballistic<00:01:46.709> tips

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
quickly because of these ballistic tips

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.600 
quickly because of these ballistic tips
they<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.200> plastic<00:01:49.200> tip<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.369> kind<00:01:50.580> of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
they have a plastic tip so it's kind of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
they have a plastic tip so it's kind of
like<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> hollow-point<00:01:51.390> bullet<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.470> do

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
like a hollow-point bullet so they do

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.779 
like a hollow-point bullet so they do
expand<00:01:53.039> fairly<00:01:53.369> quickly

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
expand fairly quickly

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.839 
expand fairly quickly
although<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.069> supposed<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.640> be

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
although the there are supposed to be

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
although the there are supposed to be
inter<00:01:57.720> bonded<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:59.310> copper<00:02:00.209> and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> lead

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
inter bonded so the copper and the lead

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
inter bonded so the copper and the lead
should<00:02:01.200> stay<00:02:01.560> together<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.550> they<00:02:02.670> did<00:02:02.849> not

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
should stay together but they did not

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.449 
should stay together but they did not
you<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.569> see<00:02:03.959> down<00:02:04.220> hopefully<00:02:05.220> you

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
you could also see down hopefully you

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.469 
you could also see down hopefully you
can<00:02:05.550> see<00:02:05.759> how<00:02:06.229> long<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.310> copper<00:02:08.580> opening<00:02:09.300> is

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
can see how long the copper opening is

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.790 
can see how long the copper opening is
and<00:02:09.750> how<00:02:10.530> short<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.510> all<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.620> weight

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and how short this is so all the weight

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.839 
and how short this is so all the weight
lost<00:02:14.720> all<00:02:15.720> hundred<00:02:16.380> grains<00:02:16.650> likely<00:02:17.610> came

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
lost all hundred grains likely came

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.460 
lost all hundred grains likely came
almost<00:02:18.150> exclusively<00:02:19.050> from<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.190> lead

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
almost exclusively from the lead

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
almost exclusively from the lead
smearing<00:02:22.470> away<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.560> anyway<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.640> see<00:02:26.849> they

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
smearing away so anyway you can see they

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.190 
smearing away so anyway you can see they
fit<00:02:27.030> together<00:02:27.360> exactly<00:02:28.760> exactly<00:02:29.760> together

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
fit together exactly exactly together

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.570 
fit together exactly exactly together
but<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:32.239> they<00:02:33.239> came<00:02:33.450> apart<00:02:34.340> there's<00:02:35.340> my

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
but they they came apart there's my

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.910 
but they they came apart there's my
review
