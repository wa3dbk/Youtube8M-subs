00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030 
so we've scored one regular goal so
that's<00:01:35.700> means<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:37.200> over<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.619> percent

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that's means it's just over one percent

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.940 
that's means it's just over one percent
we<00:01:38.490> scored<00:01:38.790> from<00:01:39.210> shots<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.170> mean<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
we scored from shots so I mean the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
we scored from shots so I mean the
obvious<00:01:41.070> conclusion<00:01:41.430> from<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.689> we

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
obvious conclusion from that is that we

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.450 
obvious conclusion from that is that we
need<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> struggle<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.130> groundbreaking

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
need a struggle it's not groundbreaking

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.359 
need a struggle it's not groundbreaking

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
looking back now I think I was slightly

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.050 
looking back now I think I was slightly
harsh<00:02:25.440> off<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.830> live<00:02:25.950> even<00:02:26.489> though<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.670> stand<00:02:26.970> by

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
harsh off to live even though I stand by

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449

everything<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.540> said<00:02:27.569> about<00:02:27.780> em<00:02:28.340> waiting<00:02:29.340> to

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
everything I said about em waiting to

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.979 
everything I said about em waiting to
the<00:02:29.550> last<00:02:29.580> minute<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.269> good<00:02:30.450> business<00:02:30.810> but

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the last minute is not good business but

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.600 
the last minute is not good business but
there<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> lot<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> mitigating<00:02:31.980> factors<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
there are a lot of mitigating factors so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.759 
there are a lot of mitigating factors so
firstly<00:02:33.000> it's<00:02:33.599> just<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> nature<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769

massive reputation when we signed him
right<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.700> but<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.660> just<00:04:39.870> doesn't<00:04:40.110> seem<00:04:40.470> like

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
right so but it just doesn't seem like

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.070 
right so but it just doesn't seem like
seems<00:04:41.490> it's<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.090> last<00:04:42.300> minute<00:04:42.750> thing<00:04:42.930> that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
seems it's the last minute thing that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.680 
seems it's the last minute thing that
bugs<00:04:43.290> me<00:04:43.410> what<00:04:43.830> why<00:04:44.070> always<00:04:44.310> last<00:04:45.150> minute<00:04:45.270> well

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
bugs me what why always last minute well

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.879 
bugs me what why always last minute well
it's<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.930> nature<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.350> transfer<00:04:46.770> window

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
it's the nature of the transfer window

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.200 
it's the nature of the transfer window
now<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.160> don't<00:04:47.340> agree<00:04:47.700> with<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.910> transfer

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
now I don't agree with the transfer

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.970 
now I don't agree with the transfer
window<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.510> think<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.900> should<00:04:48.990> be<00:04:49.050> shut<00:04:49.650> before

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
window I think it should be shut before

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.379 
window I think it should be shut before
I<00:04:50.160> don't<00:04:50.639> even<00:04:50.730> think<00:04:50.850> there<00:04:51.120> should<00:04:51.240> be<00:04:51.360> a

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
I don't even think there should be a

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.450 
I don't even think there should be a
transfer<00:04:51.900> window<00:04:52.530> because<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:52.980> ridiculous

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
transfer window because it's ridiculous

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.340 
transfer window because it's ridiculous
it's<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.669> restraint<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.090> trade<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.990> like<00:04:55.200> if

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
it's a restraint of trade it's like if

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.659 
it's a restraint of trade it's like if
you<00:04:55.470> look<00:04:55.650> if<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.919> went<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.160> any<00:04:56.520> other

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
you look if you went to any other

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.940 
you look if you went to any other
industries<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:57.870> reads<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.260> transfer<00:04:58.770> window

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
industries it reads the transfer window

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.340 
industries it reads the transfer window
we<00:04:59.220> don't<00:04:59.400> clear<00:04:59.730> about<00:05:00.000> restraint<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.020> trades

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350
