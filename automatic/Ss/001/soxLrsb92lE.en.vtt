and it seems to have lifted it up a
little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:40.230> didn't<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.770> much<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.250> this

area I mean I think I've had a small bit
of<00:00:43.680> improvement<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.510> much<00:00:45.809> along

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.270 
that it was well worth the purchase it's
about<00:01:47.070> 300<00:01:47.640> dollars<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.890> for<00:01:49.890> something<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
about 300 dollars and for something that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
about 300 dollars and for something that
you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> keep<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> long<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you can keep for a long time it's not a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
you can keep for a long time it's not a
lotion<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> apply<00:01:53.520> every<00:01:53.939> night<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
lotion you have to apply every night and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
lotion you have to apply every night and
buy<00:01:54.509> lotion<00:01:54.960> every<00:01:55.259> month<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.369> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
buy lotion every month I think that it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
buy lotion every month I think that it's
a<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.670> good<00:01:56.969> alternative<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.409> mean

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
a really good alternative to that I mean

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.569 
a really good alternative to that I mean
you<00:01:58.710> still<00:01:58.860> might<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.280> use<00:01:59.399> your

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
you still might have to use your

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.999 
you still might have to use your
moisturizer<00:02:00.060> afterwards<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.439> along<00:02:01.979> with

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

moisturizer afterwards but along with
derma<00:02:02.909> roller<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:04.409> doing<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.130> personal

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

was<00:02:10.259> using<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
was using is

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.580 
was using is
serum<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.209> comes<00:02:11.450> with<00:02:11.629> a<00:02:11.659> baby<00:02:11.900> quasar<00:02:12.200> so

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
serum that comes with a baby quasar so

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.530 
serum that comes with a baby quasar so
it's<00:02:12.739> just<00:02:12.950> baby<00:02:13.129> quasar<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.819> hyaluronic

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
acid and it's 80 dollars an ounce so you

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.030 
acid and it's 80 dollars an ounce so you
have<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.810> think<00:02:21.019> about<00:02:21.109> that<00:02:21.379> purchase<00:02:21.859> if<00:02:22.010> you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
have to think about that purchase if you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.640 
have to think about that purchase if you
really<00:02:22.370> want<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.609> have<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.909> that<00:02:23.090> badly<00:02:23.329> I<00:02:24.049> did

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
really want to have it that badly I did

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.140 
really want to have it that badly I did
it<00:02:24.769> for<00:02:24.950> half<00:02:25.219> of<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> time<00:02:25.730> because<00:02:26.060> they

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
it for half of the time because they

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.270 
it for half of the time because they
only<00:02:26.269> had<00:02:26.420> half<00:02:26.599> an<00:02:26.780> ounce<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.769> quasar

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
only had half an ounce of the quasar

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.539 
only had half an ounce of the quasar
serum<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.030> did<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:29.450> half<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.620> treatment

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
serum I did it half of the the treatment

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:32.860 
serum I did it half of the the treatment
time<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:31.879> for<00:02:32.060> four<00:02:32.269> weeks<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.629> the<00:02:32.689> other

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
time so for four weeks and the other

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.500 
time so for four weeks and the other
four<00:02:33.109> weeks<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.409> didn't<00:02:33.709> use<00:02:33.799> anything<00:02:34.129> at<00:02:34.430> all

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
four weeks I didn't use anything at all

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.849 
four weeks I didn't use anything at all
except<00:02:35.510> my<00:02:35.599> regular<00:02:36.079> Aveeno<00:02:36.650> moisturizer

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
except my regular Aveeno moisturizer

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.690 
except my regular Aveeno moisturizer
afterwards<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:39.040> that's<00:02:40.040> about<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.670> I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
afterwards and that's about it so I

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.190 
afterwards and that's about it so I
definitely<00:02:41.030> would<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.719> give<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.049> a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
definitely would have to give it a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.349 
definitely would have to give it a
positive<00:02:42.889> rating<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:43.489> it's<00:02:43.639> not<00:02:43.909> gonna<00:02:44.120> give

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
positive rating but it's not gonna give

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.940 
positive rating but it's not gonna give
you<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> results<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.079> facelift<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.799> is

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you the results of a facelift but it is

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.860 
you the results of a facelift but it is
gonna<00:02:46.069> freshen<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.209> gonna<00:02:47.389> even<00:02:47.659> out

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
gonna freshen you it's gonna even out

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.110 
gonna freshen you it's gonna even out
your<00:02:48.049> tone<00:02:48.349> it<00:02:48.799> may<00:02:48.950> even<00:02:49.310> get<00:02:49.430> rid<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.609> like<00:02:49.849> I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
your tone it may even get rid of like I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.729 
your tone it may even get rid of like I
have<00:02:50.480> freckles<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.019> you<00:02:51.139> can't<00:02:51.349> really<00:02:51.530> see

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
have freckles but you can't really see

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.710 
have freckles but you can't really see
them<00:02:51.889> here<00:02:52.159> and<00:02:53.530> these<00:02:54.530> lines<00:02:54.829> right<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.069> I

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
them here and these lines right here I

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.750 
them here and these lines right here I
find<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.870> they<00:02:57.109> are<00:02:57.139> more<00:02:57.650> smoothed<00:02:58.340> out

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
find that they are more smoothed out

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.610 
find that they are more smoothed out
like<00:02:59.329> they're<00:02:59.510> not<00:02:59.689> so<00:03:00.109> deep<00:03:02.019> besides<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.349> I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
like they're not so deep besides that I

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.280
