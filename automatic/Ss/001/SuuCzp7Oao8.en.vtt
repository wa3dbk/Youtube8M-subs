00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:14.883
 Hearthstone, Blizzard's new free online card game 

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:16.111
 is now available to everyone! 

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:19.405
 In World of Warcraft, we celebrate with a new exclusive mount: 

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:20.651
 the Steed of Hearthstone. 

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.821
 Anyone who hears Hearthstone will get it 

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:25.208
 an epic Steed of Hearthstone for World of Warcraft. 

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.010
 This video will show you what to do 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.983
 to get this mount by playing with Hearthstone 

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:31.474
 and how to get it in World of Warcraft. 

00:00:32.487 --> 00:00:34.175
 Playing Hearthstone is easy! 

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.951

 and you'll be almost ready for fun! 

00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:57.548
 From the beginning you will have to face celebrities from Warcraft 

00:00:57.748 --> 00:00:59.020
 as Millhouse Manalampo 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.401
 Hemet Nesingwary 

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:01.783
 and the Wanderer of Wisdom Cho! 

00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:04.273
 The final introductory mission will see you face 

00:01:04.473 --> 00:01:05.828
 the mighty Illidan Grantempesta. 

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:08.825
 Show him that he was not ready! 

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:10.888
 To tame the mighty Hearthstone Steed 

00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:13.475
 you will have to face worthy opponents 

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.037
 and win three Hearthstone games in Game mode! 

00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:18.645
 A notification in the game will inform you 

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.326
 that you have obtained the Hearthstone Steed. 

00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:21.992
 Once obtained the Hearthstone Steed 

00:01:22.192 --> 00:01:25.182
 you can use it with any World of Warcraft account 

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:26.725
 linked to your Battle.net account. 

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:29.630
 If you have never tried WoW 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.159
 it could be the right time! 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.054
 Download World of Warcraft from it 

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:34.254
 Battle.net Desktop application 

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:35.695
 that you used for Hearthstone. 

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.312
 Click on the World of Warcraft icon on the left 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.187
 and install it: you will get automatically 

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:42.699
 a free account for the Introductory Edition. 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.726
 Once in play, look for the nearest Mailbox: 

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:47.773
 A letter with an attachment is waiting for you. 

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.917
 Use the attachment to add 

00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:51.690
 the Hearthstone Steed to your collection: 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.437
 all the characters of level 20 or higher can use it! 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.459
 We are excited about the idea that everyone can play with Hearthstone 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.966
 What better way to celebrate this new game 

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.505
 if not with a new mount for World of Warcraft? 

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:07.360
 From now on, when you venture to Azeroth 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 you will have a trusted Hearthstone Steed 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.102
 which will bring you back for a couple of card games. 

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:12.794
 Thanks for looking at us ... 

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:14.672
 see you at the inn!
