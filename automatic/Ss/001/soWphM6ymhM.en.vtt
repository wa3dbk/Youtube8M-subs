that<00:03:34.270> it<00:03:34.600> mimics<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.470> lot<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.800> what<00:03:36.040> PS<00:03:36.370> Vita<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
that it mimics a lot of what PS Vita and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.820 
that it mimics a lot of what PS Vita and
