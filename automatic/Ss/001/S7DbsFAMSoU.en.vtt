00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
sharp when I first looked at this I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.620 
sharp when I first looked at this I
thought<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:26.970> piece<00:02:27.210> here<00:02:27.450> wasn't

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
thought that this piece here wasn't

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.890 
thought that this piece here wasn't
sharp<00:02:27.990> maybe<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.320> was<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:30.510> an<00:02:30.600> extra

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
sharp maybe it was just a just an extra

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.150 
sharp maybe it was just a just an extra
solid<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.410> know<00:02:31.500> part<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.860> part<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
solid you know part of a part of the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.830 
solid you know part of a part of the
metal<00:02:32.370> blade<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.880> grab<00:02:33.090> onto<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.750> an

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
metal blade just to grab onto for an

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.870 
metal blade just to grab onto for an
extra<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.950> extra<00:02:35.250> grip<00:02:35.430> or<00:02:35.580> whatnot<00:02:35.730> but

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
extra you know extra grip or whatnot but

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.430 
extra you know extra grip or whatnot but
no<00:02:36.120> that's<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:36.450> actually<00:02:36.840> sharp<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.350> I'd

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
no that's that's actually sharp so I'd

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.870 
no that's that's actually sharp so I'd
be<00:02:37.590> very<00:02:37.620> gets<00:02:37.980> actually<00:02:38.160> sharper<00:02:38.640> than<00:02:38.730> this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
be very gets actually sharper than this

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.670

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
colored wood kind of looks aged to give

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.550

it<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.750> classic<00:02:52.230> look<00:02:54.170> I'd<00:02:55.170> say<00:02:55.380> it's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it that that classic look I'd say it's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
it that that classic look I'd say it's
probably<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> royal<00:02:56.610> blue<00:02:57.080> mixed<00:02:58.080> with
