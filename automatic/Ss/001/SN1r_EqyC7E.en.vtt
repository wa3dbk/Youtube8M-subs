how to solve my problems I'm guessing

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
how to solve my problems I'm guessing
that<00:00:23.640> probably<00:00:24.240> over<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> two-year<00:00:25.260> period<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
that probably over a two-year period I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.400 
that probably over a two-year period I
must<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.369> read<00:00:26.670> maybe<00:00:27.330> close<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.810> thousand

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
must have read maybe close to a thousand

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
must have read maybe close to a thousand
biochemical<00:00:29.250> research<00:00:29.429> reports<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.359> maybe

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
biochemical research reports and maybe

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749

fifty to a hundred different books and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.100 
fifty to a hundred different books and
why<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.030> incredibly<00:00:33.480> useful<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
why was incredibly useful because it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.209 
why was incredibly useful because it
helped<00:00:34.260> me<00:00:34.350> solve<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.680> own<00:00:34.980> weight<00:00:35.190> loss

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
helped me solve my own weight loss

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
helped me solve my own weight loss
problems<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> ultimately<00:00:36.840> led<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
problems and ultimately led to the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
problems and ultimately led to the
formulation<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.950> gave<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.430> their

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
formulation that gave them at their

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.160 
formulation that gave them at their
principles<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.540> also<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:39.840> time

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
principles it was also very time

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.229 
principles it was also very time
consuming<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.160> wish<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.520> had<00:00:41.670> someone<00:00:41.910> point

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
consuming and I wish I had someone point

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
consuming and I wish I had someone point
me<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.510> direction<00:00:42.660> back<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.530> in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
me in the right direction back then in

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
me in the right direction back then in
essence<00:00:44.700> i<00:00:44.820> wish<00:00:44.969> i<00:00:45.090> had<00:00:45.210> someone<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.629> guide<00:00:45.809> me

essence i wish i had someone to guide me

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
essence i wish i had someone to guide me
to<00:00:46.200> tell<00:00:46.410> me<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:47.039> books<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> read<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.700> which

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to tell me which books to read in which

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
to tell me which books to read in which
to<00:00:48.210> skip<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.320> why<00:00:49.469> I'm<00:00:49.530> making<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to skip and that's why I'm making this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.529 
to skip and that's why I'm making this
video<00:00:50.039> today<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.610> there's<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> new<00:00:51.300> book
