00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.170
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.850
 agri moque for wii cohen co.fr is 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.100
 today a video a bit special 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.380
 since we are going to tinker then what is 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.509
 we're going to tinker and we'll try 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.699
 to create a hull book in silicone gel 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.679
 I was often asked what was the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.900
 better protection between the misaligned 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.509
 evening and so I thought why not 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.210
 set sail a little bit 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.359
 result that a pink hull good there I the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.469
 do it quickly just before the video is 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:34.850
 what we will try to do today 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.260
 it's something better than that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.059
 so you need a little bit of 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.870
 material like so already wiko sing faye 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.030
 of course then a cutting board 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.429
 a hull book from pro tect screen 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.899
 points like this one a twitter 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.550
 story of being able to cut out the chord 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.079
 silicone gel one set or ruler I 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.359
 took a set I find it more rigid 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.320
 and it will be more convenient to cut 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.720
 straight and as well on the hull 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.360
 silicone so we will do the test here 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.820
 with this blue hull then in a 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.150
 first time she will have to insert 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.430
 this hull with the coop book for 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.380
 can take limitations of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.100
 cutting 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.990
 so we take the cutter we will come 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.280
 actually cut out at each slice of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.390
 robot of the proofread durable so here 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.020
 I tried to cut and straight 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.020
 all formerly 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.300
 then the first side was 2nd side 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.070
 this saber is good so I go up fast 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.830
 did I made small a size of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.390
 each side then the goal of the game 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.220
 now this is actually cutting 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.200
 all the reread of the flap on the shell in 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.630
 silicone so we find ourselves a little bit 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
 above the volume button we're going to 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.680
 to cut also then for the continuation 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.590
 must dissociate the coke is the fault 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.620
 loop to be able to cut 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:17.750
 I'm going to put it on the side I see there 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.910
 so here is I going to need the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.520
 adjust to be able to cut right 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.220
 basically basically all here are all 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.630
 this part there I go cutting and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.990
 so I place well revealed to me against 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.490
 the part where I'm going to cut out is the 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.280
 hold well and I'm going to pass a shot 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.440
 cutter all the way 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.910
 in order to remove the part that is embarrassed 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.890
 by rereading it in fact from the rab 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.810
 that's it then it's well cut to no 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.600
 problem i'm going to cut out small 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.040
 nicks that I made just now 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:02.710
 to the corner like this thanks a little 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.640
 but there is almost 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.640
 he does not spend much 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.600
 but I'm concentrating 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.709
 here is now aside 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:33.860
 the same I take off the little end too much 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:38.959
 to be able to detach this end of 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:42.319
 silicone and so that's the little you 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.840
 can buy it and I'm fine I managed to 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.340
 cut it right it's pretty clean 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.260
 now there's more than just inserting 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.030
 hull book two years to see if we have 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.829
 well worked with fits perfectly 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.940
 in and that's nickel here I can the 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.129
 fold back and have no 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.440
 problem I was even better than on 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.329
 the hole street the cutting board in 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.670
 it does not even need cutting 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:11.180
 finished like now I have to 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.609
 pick up my week up in five with 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.109
 our cock I will finally disassemble 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.350
 we can try our new 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.350
 shell 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.770
 here and we will integrate it directly 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.210
 in our new hull good I want 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.640
 to have angels coke knowledgeable 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:43.690
 that an even game and rattle put one in 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:44.490
 we will put it after I have more than 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.990
 bothering 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.620
 if he wants well here's me I'll put 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.620
 a little bit of pine 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:03.310
 it was necessary in box and with cocan gel 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.470
 silicone and that's the result 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.830
 we have something nice like 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.990
 all so we can customize our 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.090
 roosters book of eight different colors 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.650
 thanks to the screen protection silicone cock 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.699
 dot com 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.830
 so we end up a little bit with 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.979
 the ultimate protection what are we 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.470
 protects your phone as well as your back 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.419
 the phone and in addition to spells the screen 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.880
 I think that there is greater risk 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.710
 thing and on top of that it stays pretty 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.270
 class and you will have a shell for 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.070
 so to say unique what suddenly 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.520
 so in the end we end up with a 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.760
 hull book at 14 euros 90 as well as a 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.830
 silicone gel shell at 8 euros 90 on 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.710
 protect screen points like what makes 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.460
 a total of 23 euros 80 for this hull 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.560
 I want to say ultimate co so it's 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.470
 very simple to realize I am really 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.849
 a poor handyman and you when you 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.789
 could see it I managed to do it 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.190
 so filming so here's for you to try 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.139
 now here I hope this 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.490
 video will have pleased you I tell you to very 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.060
 soon for next videos 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.060
 ciao
