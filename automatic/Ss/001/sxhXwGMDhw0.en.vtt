it<00:00:27.200> was<00:00:27.410> really<00:00:27.590> very<00:00:27.710> tough<00:00:28.100> for<00:00:28.310> me<00:00:28.630> on<00:00:29.630> the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
it was really very tough for me on the

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.450 
it was really very tough for me on the
beginning<00:00:30.170> of<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.350> race<00:00:30.680> I<00:00:30.890> was<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:31.250> much

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
beginning of the race I was so much

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.340 
beginning of the race I was so much
suffering<00:00:31.670> I<00:00:32.029> thought<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.450> lot<00:00:32.600> today<00:00:32.840> I<00:00:32.960> will

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
suffering I thought a lot today I will

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.980 
suffering I thought a lot today I will
probably<00:00:34.070> stop<00:00:34.340> on<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.820> first<00:00:34.850> film<00:00:35.390> because

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
probably stop on the first film because

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.610 
probably stop on the first film because
I<00:00:36.140> release<00:00:36.740> it<00:00:36.770> I<00:00:37.220> was<00:00:37.460> really<00:00:37.760> struggling<00:00:38.620> but

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
I release it I was really struggling but

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.000 
I release it I was really struggling but
apparently<00:00:40.070> everyone<00:00:40.460> was<00:00:40.790> suffering<00:00:41.210> I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
apparently everyone was suffering I

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.890 
apparently everyone was suffering I
think<00:00:43.010> it<00:00:43.130> was<00:00:43.489> perfect<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.060> not<00:00:44.480> reclined

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
think it was perfect and not reclined

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.840 
think it was perfect and not reclined
they<00:00:45.020> were<00:00:45.140> in<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.320> perfect<00:00:45.710> position

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
they were in the perfect position

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.130 
they were in the perfect position
pretend<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.940> big<00:00:47.090> final<00:00:47.360> did<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.809> stitch<00:00:47.989> we

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
pretend the big final did you stitch we

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.630 
pretend the big final did you stitch we
gasp<00:00:48.410> opponent<00:00:48.830> in<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.040> final

gasp opponent in the final

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.810 
gasp opponent in the final
maybe<00:00:50.150> only<00:00:51.580> because<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:54.350> was<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.820> good

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
maybe only because it was a good

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.360 
maybe only because it was a good
