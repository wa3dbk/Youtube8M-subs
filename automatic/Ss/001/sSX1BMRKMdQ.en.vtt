 Day three in the training camp leans like that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.030
 slowly finished the end to before 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.529
 the vfl but still his fourth test game 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 in preparation for the coming 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.200
 season 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.180
 this time it is for the team of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.380
 Chef Trainer Verbeek vs. Third-tier 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 co the first real test stone played 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 was at the sports center helker berg in 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.680
 billerbeck without ancelotti because of 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.590
 a light back whit a day 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.390
 had to take a break 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 initially quite balanced 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.200
 partie between the vfl and preußen 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.790
 Münster with increasing playing time 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 developed the eleven of chekers 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.399
 but verbeek take better 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 opportunities 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.930
 Michael Maria laid crosswise on marco 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.480
 terrazzino, however, clearly too high 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.219
 targeted 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 and also yannick haberer missed 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.410
 a header a few minutes later that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.899
 Tor simon terodde had more luck there 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.270
 The top scorer hit strong against 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.369
 the installer defended and closed 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 after 36 minutes of its fine 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.679
 single power to 1 0 for the vfl off 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.709
 just two minutes later, the next 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:22.649
 bochum's chance michael maria moves away 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.179
 Prussia keeper niklas kopp stopped short 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.009
 It was then again before half-time 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.789
 but this time it is not terodde 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.560
 Verbeek switched to 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.990
 the break again his entire staff 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.890
 Münster was now after the page change 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.050
 significantly more alert 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 after only three minutes we met at noon 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.440
 lame after a carelessness of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.810
 behind the blue white background 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
 compensation again only three minutes later 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 Prussian players then turned the game 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.880
 as marcus piossek free before andreas 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 looser emerged and the 2 1 for the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.480
 Münster 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.430
 the last of the v falls in the first 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.630
 closing phase again dangerous before the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.910
 opposing goal 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.210
 but with success timo perthel 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.250
 about the nintendo raphael of the 2 2 in 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.110
 the 74 minute inserted 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.110
 which was also the final result
