one amp and that will take about nine
hours<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.410> charger<00:00:55.770> believe<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.370> 500

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hours to charger believe so it's got 500

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
hours to charger believe so it's got 500
life<00:00:57.030> cycles<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.930> take<00:00:58.050> care<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
life cycles so you want to take care of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
life cycles so you want to take care of
the<00:00:58.440> battery<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.789> all<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.149> they

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the battery just like all of them they

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.869 
the battery just like all of them they
do<00:01:00.420> degrade<00:01:01.070> 5,000<00:01:02.070> milliamp<00:01:02.370> hours<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
do degrade 5,000 milliamp hours so if

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
do degrade 5,000 milliamp hours so if
you've<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> battery<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> samsung

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the you always get light that passes

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.000 
the you always get light that passes
through<00:02:59.960> just<00:03:00.960> what's<00:03:01.110> included<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.800> box

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
through just what's included in the box

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
through just what's included in the box
and<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.820> output<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.510> 1.5<00:03:04.080> amps<00:03:04.500> and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
and as one output it's at 1.5 amps and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.310 
and as one output it's at 1.5 amps and
the<00:03:05.460> input<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.850> about<00:03:06.090> 1am<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:06.930> should<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.260> all

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the input is about 1am so should be all

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.020 
the input is about 1am so should be all
right<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:08.310> basically<00:03:08.640> tells<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
right with that just basically tells you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.300 
right with that just basically tells you
the<00:03:09.120> charge<00:03:09.390> levels<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.160> can

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the charge levels and that so you can

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.950 
the charge levels and that so you can
see<00:03:11.580> how<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:14.750> yeah<00:03:15.750> so

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
see how it's going in that and yeah so

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.620 
see how it's going in that and yeah so
the<00:03:16.050> actual<00:03:16.200> product<00:03:16.680> itself<00:03:17.540> holding<00:03:18.540> it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
the actual product itself holding it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.850 
the actual product itself holding it
right<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.140> isn't<00:03:19.350> fully<00:03:19.530> charged<00:03:19.800> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
right now and it isn't fully charged and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.230 
right now and it isn't fully charged and
I<00:03:19.980> know<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.400> few<00:03:20.610> fully<00:03:20.790> charge<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.120> battery

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
I know on few fully charge a battery

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.820 
I know on few fully charge a battery
they<00:03:21.570> do<00:03:21.630> tend<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.960> get<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.350> bit<00:03:22.470> heavier

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
they do tend to get a little bit heavier

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.220 
they do tend to get a little bit heavier
but<00:03:23.040> first<00:03:23.910> impression<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.450> very<00:03:25.070> very<00:03:26.070> solid

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
but first impression is very very solid

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.630 
but first impression is very very solid
it<00:03:28.230> seems<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.590> really<00:03:28.830> high<00:03:28.980> quality<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.520> I'm

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
it seems a really high quality that I'm

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.630 
it seems a really high quality that I'm
quite<00:03:29.910> surprised<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.530> honest<00:03:31.920> of

quite surprised really to be honest of

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.150 
quite surprised really to be honest of
the<00:03:33.390> sort<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.080> magnitude<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.710> how<00:03:34.890> well

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
the sort of the magnitude of how well

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.400 
the sort of the magnitude of how well

that's<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.000> micro<00:04:09.270> USB<00:04:09.630> n<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:09.990> sorry<00:04:10.340> that's

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that's the micro USB n so sorry that's

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.590 
that's the micro USB n so sorry that's
why<00:04:11.490> they've<00:04:11.640> provided<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.180> because<00:04:12.480> it

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
why they've provided that because it

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.480 
why they've provided that because it
uses<00:04:12.780> micro<00:04:13.230> USB<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.710> charge<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:14.250> obviously

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
uses micro USB to charge and obviously

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.330 
uses micro USB to charge and obviously
that's<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.760> USB<00:04:15.180> output<00:04:16.040> that's<00:04:17.040> right<00:04:17.160> there

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
that's the USB output that's right there

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.539 
that's the USB output that's right there
you<00:04:17.400> go<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.790> that's<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.120> that's<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:19.049> blue<00:04:19.230> color

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
evidence to see say it is because I'm

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.529 
evidence to see say it is because I'm
not<00:04:31.470> too<00:04:31.620> sure<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.759> very<00:04:32.880> very<00:04:33.330> nice

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
not too sure but it is a very very nice

power bank so if you're in the market

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.610 
power bank so if you're in the market
for<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:36.860> reasonably<00:04:37.860> sized<00:04:38.569> battery

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
for a a reasonably sized battery

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.800 
for a a reasonably sized battery
capacity<00:04:40.620> power<00:04:40.979> bank<00:04:41.310> as<00:04:42.000> well<00:04:42.300> as<00:04:42.449> actual

capacity power bank as well as actual
size<00:04:43.080> itself<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.860> mean<00:04:44.009> that's<00:04:44.099> it<00:04:44.340> compared<00:04:44.669> to

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
size itself I mean that's it compared to

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.110 
size itself I mean that's it compared to
a<00:04:44.759> box<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.080> for<00:04:46.229> comparison's<00:04:46.830> sake
