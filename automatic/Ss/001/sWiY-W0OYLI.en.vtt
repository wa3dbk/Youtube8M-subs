SI 320 sliding panel saw this particular
machine<00:00:10.860> was<00:00:11.250> used<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.240> smaller<00:00:12.509> shop<00:00:12.809> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
machine was used in a smaller shop and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.169 
machine was used in a smaller shop and
is<00:00:13.410> an<00:00:13.590> excellent<00:00:14.250> condition<00:00:14.790> as<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.030> can

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
is an excellent condition as you can

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.840 
is an excellent condition as you can
tell<00:00:18.380> it<00:00:19.380> does<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> crosscut<00:00:20.130> capacity<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
tell it does have a crosscut capacity of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.620 
tell it does have a crosscut capacity of
3,200<00:00:21.510> millimeters<00:00:22.250> 126<00:00:23.250> inches<00:00:23.670> or<00:00:24.269> roughly

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
3,200 millimeters 126 inches or roughly

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.730 
3,200 millimeters 126 inches or roughly
10<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> half<00:00:25.109> feet<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:27.330> does<00:00:28.080> slide<00:00:28.500> with

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
10 and a half feet it does slide with

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.889 
10 and a half feet it does slide with
these<00:00:30.380> as<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.560> see<00:00:32.690> it<00:00:33.690> does<00:00:33.870> have

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
these as you can see it does have

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.700 
these as you can see it does have
scoring<00:00:35.540> 300<00:00:36.540> millimeter<00:00:36.870> blade<00:00:37.140> capacity

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
scoring 300 millimeter blade capacity

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.750 
scoring 300 millimeter blade capacity
which<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.890> basically<00:00:38.329> 12-inch<00:00:40.640> there's<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
which is basically 12-inch there's that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.389 
which is basically 12-inch there's that
scoring<00:00:42.090> unit<00:00:42.420> only<00:00:43.230> thing<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.469> did<00:00:43.620> notice<00:00:43.950> is

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
scoring unit only thing we did notice is

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.900 
scoring unit only thing we did notice is
that<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:46.590> blade<00:00:46.800> splitter<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.280> missing<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that the blade splitter is missing that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
that the blade splitter is missing that
comes<00:00:48.120> basically<00:00:48.329> mounts<00:00:48.719> off<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.110> yarn

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
comes basically mounts off the back yarn

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
comes basically mounts off the back yarn
comes<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.520> overhead<00:00:50.820> guard<00:00:51.149> mounts

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
comes up and this overhead guard mounts

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
comes up and this overhead guard mounts
to<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.020> blade<00:00:52.199> splitter<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to that blade splitter so that's the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.979 
to that blade splitter so that's the
only<00:00:53.879> thing<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> does<00:00:54.329> not<00:00:54.510> come<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
only thing that does not come with the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.549 
only thing that does not come with the
machine<00:00:56.780> as<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.260> machine

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
machine as you can see this machine

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.000 
machine as you can see this machine
isn't<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.010> wonderful<00:00:59.399> condition<00:01:01.010> clean

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
isn't just wonderful condition clean

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.149 
isn't just wonderful condition clean
case<00:01:02.989> it's<00:01:03.989> clean<00:01:04.229> both<00:01:04.379> mechanically<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
case it's clean both mechanically and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.870 
case it's clean both mechanically and
cosmetically<00:01:05.939> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.750> nice<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> see

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.600 

you<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.299> additional<00:01:13.490> scoring<00:01:14.490> blade

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you do get an additional scoring blade

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.420 
you do get an additional scoring blade
that's<00:01:14.909> brand<00:01:15.180> new<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.390> box

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
have the back panel and the back support
leg<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.790> those<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.299> included<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
leg off those are also included as you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
leg off those are also included as you
can<00:01:40.200> tell<00:01:40.759> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.000> take<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> look<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
can tell if you just take a look at the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.109 
can tell if you just take a look at the
work<00:01:42.869> surfaces<00:01:43.320> you'll<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> ton

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
work surfaces you'll see that not a ton

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.219 
work surfaces you'll see that not a ton
of<00:01:45.149> use<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:45.990> paint

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
of use here because all this paint

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.520 
of use here because all this paint
usually<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.680> rubs<00:01:46.890> off<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.090> see

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
usually just rubs off and we can see

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.170 
usually just rubs off and we can see
it's<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.790> good<00:01:50.970> condition<00:01:53.180> go

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's in really really good condition go

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
it's in really really good condition go
down<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> look<00:01:54.659> real<00:01:54.840> fast<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
down and look real fast down here as you

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.399 
down and look real fast down here as you
can<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:58.280> really<00:01:59.280> clean<00:01:59.490> machine
