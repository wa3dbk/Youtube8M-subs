a<00:01:56.759> franchise<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.509> fear<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.320> don't

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
a franchise out of fear and I don't

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
a franchise out of fear and I don't
think<00:01:58.680> any<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.009> individual<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.670> put<00:01:59.820> himself

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
think any one individual can put himself

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490 
think any one individual can put himself
ahead<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> coach<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.049> team<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
ahead of the coach or the team of the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.139 
ahead of the coach or the team of the
franchise<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.219> therefore<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.640> decision<00:02:03.000> had

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
franchise and therefore our decision had

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.390 
franchise and therefore our decision had
to<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.299> made
