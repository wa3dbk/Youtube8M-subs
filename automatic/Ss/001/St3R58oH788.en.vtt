00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 this program is presented by itself 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 all in one app droughts or 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.840
 people were focused on this episode we'll 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.099
 to talk about the movie under the same 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.099
 star ok 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.070
 First of all it is worth mentioning 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.980
 this film is based on a 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.930
 book by jon wing and who 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.940
 john wayne the interesting thing here is that 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.460
 John Green is known to be a 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.739
 youtuber or quite famous and quite 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.650
 important and within their channels has 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.900
 programs like mind words show cars 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.940
 out loud 'which is part of the blogs 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.860
 brothers and the truth is that all these 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.989
 channels are very good and the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.879
 we highly recommend not only if 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.590
 they are fans of the book and now they know that 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.210
 It had an impact but if they like 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.070
 General content channels 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.980
 youtube these channels are extremely 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.199
 good and entertaining and they return all the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.210
 What is this film film 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.129
 basically under the same star 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.920
 we have two characters on one side 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.080
 we have heysel and we have awards for the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.909
 side of heysel we have this girl who was 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.220
 diagnosed with cancer and already 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.780
 in step reason terminal 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.210
 which obviously it is very 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.090
 Sad depressed life as they no longer 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.070
 it seems very rosy go and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.690
 Another thing is the male character 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.180
 theaters 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.220
 a cancer survivor so 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.250
 Obviously this made him a 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.470
 much more positive person with a new 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.480
 air of life so to speak and who 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.250
 already recovered all the hopes that in 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.590
 perhaps also time were as 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.110
 the De Keyser and nice arises when 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.630
 ghost's character begins to help 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.300
 to haters to see life again from a 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.580
 good way is to push her to give 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.530
 realize that life is beautiful that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.240
 there is still hope that despite 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.010
 that bad things are happening there 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.440
 to enjoy the time we have left and 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.290
 see things in a much more 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 happy happier and remove that gray life 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.880
 who is living heysel and take it to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.360
 something much more optimistic the truth 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.460
 entered extremely cheesy areas and the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 argument and if it is true it is a 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.900
 extremely fair story but it is very 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.490
 well it conducted ie not reach 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.920
 that point where you're all 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.420
 palate full of honey and you say by 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.610
 Please, with your announcement that it's over 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.770
 even as this man as the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.510
 movie really takes you very well 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.300
 emotions let's say that when you have 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.970
 to be laughing as if it makes you laugh 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.580
 sad is sad the same thing happens with 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 motivation with encouragement is a 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.900
 film that takes very good care of 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.880
 hand to these feelings and everything that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.920
 the film has to say 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.530
 Feel not achieve in a very good way 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.200
 fucking like I tell you in this about what it is 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.580
 too cheesy or very roams 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190
 speak it is really 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.900
 very tender and very entertaining something cute 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.940
 which is also parent is that the two 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.590
 Characters are very charismatic no longer 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.540
 we have the character of the girl 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.770
 Depressed at one point we dislike and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.390
 then why not write on it or 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.490
 optimistic but the two characters 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.980
 They are really nice so 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.110
 We can empathize with either two or 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.240
 with the woman with the child and let's say you 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 You can connect to any of these 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.960
 two characters since both are 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
 interesting characters and very complete 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.950
 charismatic even though the movie 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.170
 It is quite entertaining there is a point 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.050
 that says you can feel a little long is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.250
 say how we have a situation 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.560
 constant happening all the time these 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.780
 feelings that make us laugh cry and 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.180
 happy and so at one point you may be 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.370
 again a bit the same so it is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.080
 they can feel the film a bit long 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.819
 I felt so to speak maybe you do not 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.830
 the same thing happens to me and to the other 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.080
 I also felt that I missed a little more 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.940
 know about the lives of his family 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.310
 his parents since I have understood that 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.379
 in the book there is a very good balance 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.540
 Heysel between life and in the life of 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.790
 gaulle and here he leaned much more 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.709
 Heysel to life and a state to see 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.900
 a little more background of this 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.120
 character also seeing it from the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.739
 movie point of view since I have not 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.930
 had the opportunity to read this book 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.239
 the version looks like a movie very well 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.000
 carried very entertaining and with a very 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.120
 good message and I therefore giving it four 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.859
 stars of five if you are avid 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.870
 tell me what those prices and read the 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.120
 book they have not read and how they think 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.220
 this movie worked based on that and 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.079
 leave all that down here in the 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.789
