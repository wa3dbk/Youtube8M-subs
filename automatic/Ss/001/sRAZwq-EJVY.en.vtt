practice<00:01:37.920> team<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> things<00:01:39.150> they

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
practice team one of the things they

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.230 
practice team one of the things they
learn<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.960> review<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> literature

benchmarking with other organizations

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
benchmarking with other organizations
and<00:01:44.750> through<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.930> process<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and through that process I think it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.380 
and through that process I think it
really<00:01:47.700> emulates<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:50.220> type<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.549> poster<00:01:51.210> they

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
really emulates the type of poster they

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
really emulates the type of poster they
create<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.399> paying<00:01:53.610> attention

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
create because they are paying attention

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.569 
create because they are paying attention
to<00:01:54.409> what<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.740> written<00:01:56.100> word<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.460> their

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
to what is in the written word or their

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
to what is in the written word or their
scholarly<00:01:56.969> work<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.540> also<00:01:58.110> what's<00:01:58.350> available

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
scholarly work and also what's available

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.069 
scholarly work and also what's available
through<00:01:59.070> their<00:01:59.640> contacts<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.509> networking

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
through their contacts or networking

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.670 
through their contacts or networking
with<00:02:01.560> other<00:02:01.770> organizations<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.229> think<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
with other organizations I think the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.249 
with other organizations I think the
process<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.490> using<00:02:05.670> evidence-based<00:02:06.479> practice

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
process of using evidence-based practice

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.309 
process of using evidence-based practice
really<00:02:08.099> provides<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:09.030> mather<00:02:09.390> more<00:02:10.020> thorough

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
really provides a mather more thorough

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.220 
really provides a mather more thorough
poster<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.300> actually<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.780> my

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
poster and actually it is my

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.160 
poster and actually it is my
more<00:02:13.560> usable<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:15.000> staff<00:02:15.510> nurses<00:02:15.959> throughout

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
more usable for staff nurses throughout
