00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.789
 recently we have had a happy interest 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:09.669
 note 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.409
 for the Dutch language 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.069
 and talked about that with doctor camping board member of the society 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:20.400
 our language management yes one of two things to improve in the 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:21.939
 preface 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.759
 past time instead of past time now there are too 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.099
 look forward to interest rather than defensive interest that path 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.530
 is made frequently in dutch it is already broken 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.620
 participle last weekend nowadays part becomes descending 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.170
 participation will in principle 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.210
 if it is brought adjectively 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.060
 looks at the mirror 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.320
 incorporated therein 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.300
 piece on my part 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.050
 nevertheless it is true that there is kipping that under your inspiring guidance a communiquÃ© 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.070
 no that's not worth it i said 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.330
 the steering is gas bombs and inspiring steering may I hope mine 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.420
 leadership who is animated and does not have to be visitors 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.620
 go anyway 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.420
 diane but it is true that in the dutch language many conditions do things 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.630
 happen 2 9 confusing 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.190
 I mean to say really a push things things they themselves do not expect 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.340
 I am very strict there 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.400
 someone must have caught it 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.030
 you are also notorious as a writer of the letter you sent on this issue of h 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.130
 you say submitted letters 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.250
 the worrying not to say sending in the three tons therefore falls somewhat 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.300
 already made there 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.220
 yes but he pulled the chain always must make some sort of effort earlier 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.150
 so far in the disappointed results 9 the results are disappointing 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.890
 and that you come to the point because it is up to date 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.970
 unfortunately limited and my time is unfortunately 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.510

 what I do not completely miss I deserve you nothing they only know us 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.620
 to mediate 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.649
 but I say that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.710
 no we are not mediating at the campsite, I just wanted my 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.099
 making compliments for informed tasks I now want a glass of water 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.730
