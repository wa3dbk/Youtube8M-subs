lot of tools a lot of know-how it's

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.330 
lot of tools a lot of know-how it's
actually<00:00:16.199> easier<00:00:16.529> than<00:00:16.770> good<00:00:16.859> thing<00:00:17.070> I'm

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
actually easier than good thing I'm

simple way this right here is a compact
or<00:00:23.340> an<00:00:23.400> HP<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> very<00:00:25.199> basic<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.130> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
or an HP so very basic way to do it

you want this to unsnap be a little

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950 
you want this to unsnap be a little
difficult<00:01:56.430> once<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> top<00:01:57.480> section

don't press against a glass too much

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.900 
don't press against a glass too much
because<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:12.000> want<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.480> snap<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.110> glass
