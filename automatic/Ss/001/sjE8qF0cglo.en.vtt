00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hai xente youtube we are here in the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 red channel more than 55 and in this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.290
 I will teach them how to do the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.929
 tutorial of pencil effect in photoshop 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.040
 cs 6 and good is to say the truth is that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.349
 it's a lot that does not do a tutorial 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 then let's quickly start what 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.440
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.860
 clone our first layer with control 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.170
 j 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.030
 once having the coloring of 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.470
 our coat we are leaving city ​​edition 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.770
 sorry 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.920
 image 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.650
 mode and we're going to go grayscale 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.330
 here we will look like this little 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.610
 sign that says change modes can 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.410
 affect the appearance of the layers you want 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 combine the layers before changing 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.590
 sides of changing so we will 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.530
 we do not change and allow a second 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.540
 because you hear bells ok they took the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.460
 caution bells and we put you discard 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.050
 very well this will make our image 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.960
 come back black and white but also the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.250
 image that we have of bottom is can 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.830
 see that I also change although only 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.500
 we are acting in the copy layer but 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.270
 well then now once we have 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 our black and white image 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.060
 we press the control keys more and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.290
 to reverse the selection of colors and 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.240
 now we are going to upload expose the color 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.270
 this will make our entire layer look 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.490
 white do not hurry up there is not been 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.790
 erased from nothing simply everything has 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.690
 turned white good more or less I understand 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.590
 now we go directly to filter 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.630
 blur and our good friend 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.180
 blur cause will no longer be all the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 work 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.230
 and so this appears the blur leads to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 depend a lot on your image but as 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.830
 you will see the greater the blur because 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 the image has less this effect and if 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.970
 we increase it because it seems that the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.830
 image is simply blank and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.130
 black not then here you have 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.040
 that calculate more or less what will be 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.860
 of your image see in 72 pixels it seems 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.310
 that is simply black and white 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.729
 I naturally work on 11 or 15 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.259
 depending on the image in this 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.720
 I think I'll leave it at 15 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.970
 Well, if I like it 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.270
 we give ok and good our image is 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.690
 list here is already the pencil effect 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.130
 finished and good that can be done with 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.100
 this good effect we can also do 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.970
 other effects like the one I have here or 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.739
 We can see 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.840
 this is the image we have that 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.400
 we just created a few moments but 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.340
 of x we can base ourselves to make several 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 things for example cut out the background 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.099
 and use this same and changing the layer 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.220
 overexposure of color we can give a 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:48.090
 Comic type effect or just cutting 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.200
 the background and giving it something darker 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.260
 here you can put 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.220
 experiment and they can even put it in 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.530
 normal disappear the layer exactly and 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.959
 make play with filters good 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.489
 then there you experience me 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.200
 took care and comment subscribe and 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.519

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.519
