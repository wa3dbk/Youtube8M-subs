00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 and exactly then we 're going to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.120
 present a proposal a matriarchy 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.400
 they tell me that when they went to do the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.830
 reportage they tried the map empanadas 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.870
 white and they were great they have 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.340
 come to national fairs like 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.039
 mixture for example and has been very 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.039
 recognized let's see this sweet information 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.340
 with more than 100 years in the market the 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.110
 sweet tradition of a family and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.390
 lambayecana has led to 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.160
 white manjar pies are one of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.160
 the favorite desserts for many 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.920
 this candy store has the last name of its 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.470
 founding today none of the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.630
 owners keep it to know more 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.760
 of this tradition we talk with glory 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.100
 one of the successors of this 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.790
 and because family has requested no longer 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.770
 we carry but the same recipe follows 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.930
 same recipe the same tradition of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:18.180
 oven that is mud and I myself learned 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.180
 and supervised me 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.850
 that to make the dough the procedure 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.890
 of the mass and so I'm supervising 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.570
 all how is it going to be left 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.570
 just like it was before 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.549
 this business of sweet pies and 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.770
 has four generations of 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.869
 this family doÃ±a gloria shows us the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.869
 procedure to elaborate said delicacy 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.150
 good to make a good pie 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.240
 we have first the process is the first 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.840
 We put the flour is a mixture of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.940
 flour with butter water and the little secret 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.030
 that I always carry it that I'm not going to 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.259
 say because they are going to copy themselves so it is 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.640
 that makes me already supervising the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.510
 texture of the mass so that it does not 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.049
 make neither hard nor very 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.959
 soft because otherwise it would already break and 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.810
 little by little already with the guys I'm going 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.870
 advancing and let it rest so 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.879
 minus two hours three hours the mass and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.549
 then we are continuing with the process of 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:35.260
 paloteo that we call him we put him 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.390
 yamaha white and added rest a little while 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.599
 we started with the repulse that is called 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.790
 re thumb the pie and so little by little 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.670
 you see that we already let it rest on 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.350
 oven and has rested is also removed to 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.260
 the embers and already begins to embroider 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.890
 the pie is removed we put ourselves to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.930
 cool a little bit we already have the copper 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.840
 of honey and by teaching where is the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.350
 dog , honey, I put the honey 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.670
 candy point and with a brush but 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.670

 all in an artisanal way with its oven 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.440
 mud because they think that this way you do not lose 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.600
 essence and flavor 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.110

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.360
