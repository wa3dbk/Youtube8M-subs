00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.380
 when students today I want to talk to you about this ration 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.249
 cell phone 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.189
 which is a mechanism for absolutely fantastic 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.519
 although some students have complained that it is difficult to understand 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.470
 Let's try to solve this problem of yours today. 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.699
 first of all to understand well cellular respiration 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.749
 You need to understand that this was born here. 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.820
 do the cellular respiration 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.810
 what is the central objective of this process? 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.090
 watch well 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.240
 you feed on various types of organic matter carbohydrates 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.270
 lipids proteins 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.340
 all of them can merge with pleasurable energy 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.710
 can use a carbohydrate protein as a source of 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.460
 energy 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.900
 but imagine how complicated it would be 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.200
 have to deal with these three alternatives the whole time 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.750
 imagine that the cell will make an active membrane transport 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.470
 and you well know that active transport of membrane gas energy 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.760
 imagine if the cell at that moment had to decide 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.580
 and now 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 I get energy from a carbohydrate protein the video diwali to do 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.659
 this transport does not give Syria confused 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.810
 moreover I will have to have in them but adapted to all this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.780
 on top of the carbohydrate workouts on top providing the non-enforceability is not 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.560
 like this 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 What does the cell do then 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 it picks up different sources of energy 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.130
 as proteins as lippi provided with carbohydrates 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.870
 extract energy from these components 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.870
 and use this energy to produce atp 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.810
 it ends up converting different energy sources 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.930
 in a good move we thought she had to have 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 he said that the goal of cellular respiration 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 this is what we are worth and is in the group of international 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.829
 arrive me exchange with the dollar arrived already with discount and emc 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.760
 drawing the European invitations concluded 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.480
 everyone coming to occupy a house of exchange have converted from summer 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.930
 It's a lot easier to do business with the same people 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.949
 then the goal of country cellular respiration 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.869
 draw energy from different points 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.739
 and it is convenient for everything an energy currency only that is the answer 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:16.599
 but after all 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.229
 What did she have? 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.489
 it could be mars 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.059
 the atp is a molecule of adn nÃ© 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.229
 linked to a rigorous denied the 3 with the facts 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.459
 getting back to normal 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.039
 it is the goal of eliminating 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.299
 if you for example replace the next passione date defined by 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.199
 agony 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.589
 Are you going to let lose? 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:43.909
 now why atp is so important to leave 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.949
 the question 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.219
 is that with tbz loads a lot of energy 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.289
 intrigues and connections of his fans facts 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 the bonds of phosphate with others are high-energy bonds 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.599
 at some point very close to the rigid life well into the beginning of life 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.099
 ended up setting atp as the currency of exchange 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.399
 but could have been managed pv for example with the coordinator the corpse 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.079
 at the beginning of life because this because even as currency in gt we inherit it 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:19.299
 now by what he realized in time to celebrate the release of the girl and 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.229
 it is not 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:25.109
 the atp is not for energy storage the atp is produced to provide 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:25.800
 energy 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.379
 immediately 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.669
 if the people want to store energy long term is much better produced in the wall 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.169
 the atp is produced to be used already the base used now 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.849
 and this goal of cellular respiration 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.109
 extract energy and food 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.109
 to product 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.259
 All right, but how does cellular respiration do this? 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.699
 have you seen there that she can shake the day from different food sources 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.719
 but let's get glucose as models 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.289
 why glucose is the main source of energy for the saw 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:07.479
 respiration will happen in three stages agricole cib the cycle of strikes and 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.469
 I ended up breathing 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.709
 So let's start by going to the strike for the month. 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.899
 you have already learned that the purpose of cellular respiration and produce steam 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.970
 but glycolysis produces few adherents in fact 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:26.590
 at the beginning of that college I am not do not produce tpi as the toxic gas 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.610
 2 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.169
 so at the beginning that college will consume 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.550
 two attacks 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.469
 but this is not going to be a problem 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.819
 what changes is the continuity of the chemical reactions of the agricultural 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.189
 these apps that were lost at the beginning are recovered 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.109
 which by the end of the year tax are produced four carpets 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.189
 agricultural consumers having breasts 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.490
 but produces 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.490
 then it ends with positive balance of two supporters 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.490
 2 to dpca very public 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.789
 but glycolysis does a very important job 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.650
 understand well 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.680
 the energy part of the glucose state your athletes 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.660
 who lost meters 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.570
 popsci life 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.550
 Remember that of chemistry 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.559
 which forced alex and I do what happens to the molecule of wineries 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.520
 she would be meter and rich in glucose energy 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.639
 and nearly 60 meters in 10 states for a molecule called nothing too much 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.340
 however nothing much receives these electrons becomes dh 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.610
 There are many students who ask me but what is the function of the north 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.439
 the function of nothing from asking for drawn up diameters and clean is on the line 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.630
 it plays an important role in transporting 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.559
 anadia 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:54.229
 you will see that the energy of these electrons that the charge wave will be 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.279
 used in the last stage of breathing 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.279
 which we call the respiratory chain 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.520
 Besides that 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.800
 agricole cib 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.119
 breaking down the glucose molecule is the 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.229
 see the glucose has six cable 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.180
 during the sequence of record reactions 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.539
 the glucose is broken in half 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.520
 and produces two compounds with three carbons 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.409
 what we call peroba 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.189
 so let's review everything 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.210
 4 key 10 major agricultural 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.249
 first 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.669
 at first it consumes two attendants 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.409
 second important event of the record 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.270
 then it produces a loss picture 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.479
 seals consumers and produces four 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.259
 she will end up with a positive balance 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.080
 two attackers 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.650
 big bowling 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.199
 or who decides who to 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.289
 that is 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:54.889
 extract energy-rich letters from glucose 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.870
 and passes into nothingness 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.330
 which becomes dh 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.969
 an afternoon of shopping for vehicles 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:05.379
 it splits glucose molecules in half 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:06.830
 and ends 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.830
 however other compounds of three positions 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.439
 called 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:15.860
 folks 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.979
 this was the first stage of cellular respiration 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:22.100
 see also the videos on the paris gravel 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.419
 and I ended up breathing
