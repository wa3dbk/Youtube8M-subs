feed the water into the canister whereas

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
feed the water into the canister whereas
this<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:52.320> has<00:00:53.010> its<00:00:53.160> own<00:00:53.280> pump

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this one here actually has its own pump

this one here actually has its own pump
which<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:54.030> drive<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> water<00:00:54.690> from<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
which can drive the water from the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.220 
which can drive the water from the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
actually full of water which you might

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
actually full of water which you might
hesitate<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.299> use<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> canister<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
hesitate to use the canister on so the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
hesitate to use the canister on so the
design<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:09.330> simple<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.200> from

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
design is very simple it's got from

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.980 
design is very simple it's got from
inlet<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.310> strainers<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
inlet with strainers and it's got the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
inlet with strainers and it's got the
pump<00:01:13.229> itself<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> pump<00:01:15.060> shoots<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
pump itself and the pump shoots to the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.499 
pump itself and the pump shoots to the
inlet<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> speed<00:01:17.520> controlled<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.390> you've

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
inlet it is speed controlled then you've

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
inlet it is speed controlled then you've
got<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> outlet<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.979> comes<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
got the outlet it comes with all the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
got the outlet it comes with all the
media's<00:01:21.030> inside<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.229> obviously<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
media's inside but obviously the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.230 
media's inside but obviously the
canister<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> basically<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.820> big<00:01:23.939> reactor

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
canister is basically just a big reactor

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.219 
canister is basically just a big reactor
that<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:24.840> whatever<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.140> want

that you can put whatever you want
inside<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:27.990> good<00:01:28.290> results

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
inside it and we get very good results

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.740 
inside it and we get very good results
out<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:29.909> impeller<00:01:30.180> inside

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
out of it there is an impeller inside

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.740 
out of it there is an impeller inside
the<00:01:31.430> little<00:01:32.430> pump<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.119> every<00:01:33.780> quarter<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
the little pump so every quarter or so

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.289 
the little pump so every quarter or so
it's<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> pop<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.119> top<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it's good just to pop the top off it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
it's good just to pop the top off it
give<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> clean<00:01:40.740> take<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
give it a bit of a clean take the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
give it a bit of a clean take the
impeller<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.240> clean<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> housing<00:01:43.229> inside

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
impeller out clean the housing inside

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.950 
impeller out clean the housing inside
pop<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.369> again<00:01:44.579> obviously<00:01:45.479> give

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
pop it all back in again obviously give

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.260 
pop it all back in again obviously give
the<00:01:46.140> canister<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> clean<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.130> required<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the canister a clean as required and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.830 
the canister a clean as required and
away<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> slightly

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
away you go so it's just a slightly

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
away you go so it's just a slightly
different<00:01:52.110> canisters<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.040> typical

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
different canisters here typical

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.569 
different canisters here typical
canister<00:01:54.119> filter<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.350> suits<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
canister filter and it just suits a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.179 
canister filter and it just suits a
couple<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> extra<00:01:57.299> applications<00:01:57.979> where<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
couple of extra applications where you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.530 
couple of extra applications where you
can't<00:01:59.460> you'll<00:01:59.670> normally<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.360> your

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
can't you'll normally use your

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.560 
can't you'll normally use your
traditional<00:02:00.899> canister<00:02:01.320> filter
