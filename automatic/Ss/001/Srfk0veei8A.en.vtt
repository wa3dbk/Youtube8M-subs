00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:15.519
 [music] 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.010
 good afternoon my dear welcome 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.760
 I'm cooking pancakes to my kitchen today 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.420
 on kefir 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.510
 Here are such soft comfortable openwork 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.700
 and very very delicious pancakes on 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.330
 Kefir I cook in two different ways 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.489
 on hot kefir on cold kefir in 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.460
 anyway they do not get tasty 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.440
 tender soft well laced of such 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.790
 pancakes are different here these pancakes on 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.760
 cold kefir they 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.580
 finely laced with small holes it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.220
 hot yogurt turns holes 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.949
 bigger but tell you about it in the course 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.860
 cooking so let's start for the recipe to us 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.360
 need 400 grams of kefir kefir 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.820
 room temperature I have it specially 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.799
 did not warm up 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.950
 now run 2 chicken eggs add 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.380
 add a little salt if desired 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.000
 sugar and like to make pancakes dust 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520
 sweet so I put 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.950
 two tablespoons of sugar can either 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.060
 sugar is not at all I would take it 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.880
 more less in general to your taste 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.810
 all loose and gradually add 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.820
 knead flour pancake dough soda I 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.859
 I will enter the last moment 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.710
 so now we need to make dough 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:37.100
 was a bit thicker than the dough we 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.420
 usually cook for pancakes for everything 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.960
 kneading dough me this time 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.880
 It took about 170 grams of flour but you 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.579
 may need a little more or a little 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.710
 less this is still a little watery 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.969
 because we will add later 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.549
 soda solution so we make dough 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.140
 slightly thicker 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.170
 after the dough is mixed 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.210
 I'll leave him to stand but at least 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.189
 half an hour and you can cook it 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.219
 leave at room 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.550
 temperature say two to three hours 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.500
 pancakes from this will only get better 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.620
 they will be more elastic and will not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.780
 tear during frying 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.450
 fake a small glass we will dissolve not extinguished 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.480
 soda average half a liter of kefir 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.700
 half a teaspoonful can 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.250
 with a small slides not slaked soda 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.269
 we breed small quantities of soda 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.780
 cold water and then the dough again 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.370
 hesitating if you have lumps and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.099
 this did not do what is not dough and so 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.769
 it turned out uniform we add a couple 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.340
 tablespoons of vegetable oil to 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.269
 fry pancakes in a dry pan 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.569
 soda solution all stir and go 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.349
 fry pancakes since the dough 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.510
 we have included 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.519
 cooking oil grease pan 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.440
 I will be just before frying first 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.980
 pancake all the other pancakes i will 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.959
 fry in a dry skillet 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.290
 pour pancake batter into the pan it 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.310
 distributing and waiting when we have shoulders 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.200
 fry on one side of it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.540
 turn and fry with another 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.980
 parties 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.319
 pancakes on such a dough I fry but 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.090
 moderately hot pan that is 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.670
 she must be so hot to 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.319
 pancake just bounced off of it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.540
 skype we need time to 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.250
 soda managed to react a priori with 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.829
 acid contained kefir 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.079
 so that she has time to decompose in the process 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.989
 pancakes roasting and as a result 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.530
 pancakes are well cooked and turned out 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.829
 such 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.660
 finely porous finely laced but if 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.760
 do you want holes on pancakes 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.150
 were bigger so they were more 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.230
 fishnet to cook such pancakes should be on 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.660
 warm yogurt 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.139
 you heat kefir not hot 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.760
 otherwise it is just an hour to warm 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.190
 then knead the pancake dough then 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.349
 beat egg add salt sugar 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.799
 flour 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.720
 stir and then into this warm dough 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.519
 add soda solution stir 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.099
 soda starts to react instantly with 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.039
 acid contained kefir partly 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:21.500
 decompose in warm solution and dough 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.770
 starts loosening it rises 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.410
 more tests did not stir, and immediately 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.080
 go fry pancakes fry them on 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.890
 very hot pan result 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.710
 pancakes obtained with large holes 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.970
 i fry and so and so lately 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.010
 like this is such a small delicacy 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.090
 so our pancakes are prepared from such 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.660
 amount of dough 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.350
 they will be from 14 to 16 depending on 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.660
 pancake thickness on pan size 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.100
 such they turned out very soft 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.750
 very sweet openwork very tasty 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.780
 You can serve pancakes with sour cream. 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.170
 melted butter and jam 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.810
 with honey any variant it will be very 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.870
