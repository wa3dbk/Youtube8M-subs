00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
fights Mousasi has be one guy and I

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.969 
fights Mousasi has be one guy and I
think<00:04:51.880> his<00:04:52.000> name<00:04:52.150> was<00:04:52.240> Queen<00:04:52.570> Latifah<00:04:53.139> and<00:04:53.260> so

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
think his name was Queen Latifah and so

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.530 
think his name was Queen Latifah and so
he<00:04:54.160> hasn't<00:04:54.370> put<00:04:54.669> himself<00:04:54.820> anywhere<00:04:55.389> in<00:04:55.479> a

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
little nog again so this idea of giving

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.909 
little nog again so this idea of giving
the<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:01.750> audience<00:06:02.139> what<00:06:02.320> they<00:06:02.350> want<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.680> see

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
the the audience what they want to see

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.190 
the the audience what they want to see
by<00:06:03.370> creating<00:06:04.090> an<00:06:04.270> audience<00:06:04.660> for<00:06:04.900> seeing

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
by creating an audience for seeing

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.960 
by creating an audience for seeing
something<00:06:05.289> and<00:06:05.860> when<00:06:06.220> you<00:06:06.310> look<00:06:06.490> at<00:06:06.669> at

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
something and when you look at at

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.420 
something and when you look at at
Gustafson<00:06:07.840> vs.<00:06:08.260> little<00:06:08.530> nog<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:08.950> think<00:06:09.310> that

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
Gustafson vs. little nog I think that

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.760 
Gustafson vs. little nog I think that
feels<00:06:09.580> like<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:09.970> idea<00:06:10.300> like<00:06:10.510> Daniel<00:06:11.440> Cormier

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
feels like the idea like Daniel Cormier

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.409 
feels like the idea like Daniel Cormier
could<00:06:12.039> wreck<00:06:12.250> our<00:06:12.430> rematch<00:06:12.760> so<00:06:13.060> let's<00:06:13.240> give<00:06:13.390> a

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
could wreck our rematch so let's give a

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.149 
could wreck our rematch so let's give a
little<00:06:13.659> nog<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.289> maybe<00:06:14.620> that's<00:06:14.890> a<00:06:15.010> fight

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
little nog and maybe that's a fight

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.409 
little nog and maybe that's a fight
he'll<00:06:15.340> win<00:06:15.520> that's<00:06:15.729> not<00:06:15.880> something<00:06:16.150> we<00:06:16.270> used

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
he'll win that's not something we used

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:16.800 
he'll win that's not something we used
to<00:06:16.510> see

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
to see

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.570 
to see

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
so much out of the UFC that could be a

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.100 
so much out of the UFC that could be a
