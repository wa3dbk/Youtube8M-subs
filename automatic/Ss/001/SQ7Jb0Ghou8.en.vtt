 today we see the video review 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.220
 of a very special accessory that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.009
 will surely tickle the idea is 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.320
 as soon as you have the chance 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.110
 you will buy for what it is 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 as you can see it is a normal usb key 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.600
 the kingston product is called 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.090
 datatraveler micro duo and in this case 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.120
 the version that I and you were able to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.660
 the white then a 16 usb stick 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.950
 gigabyte 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.900
 ok you will tell me and then what to reject 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.770
 will be able to do the video review of 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.130
 a usb stick 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.530
 this usb key has the peculiarity 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.079
 to have on the opposite side 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
 the micro usb connector this thing wants 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.420
 to say means that it can be inserted 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.049
 in any android device that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.210
 clearly usb supports on the go for 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.299
 transfer data or increase memory 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 of the say of our smartphone the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.450
 everything is really very simple not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.700
 need drivers are good for nothing if 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.050
 areas clearly only the smartphone 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.280
 compatible 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.229
 I now have a lgg flex with the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 which one to try 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.090
 let's see what you see will suffice 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 simply insert really from 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.869
 right part and wait for it to come 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.830
 detected by the operating system lg ha 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.020
 a very nice interface you see that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.130
 we immediately shows some options I 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 I want to open the file manager 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 we select all the files you see this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 the internal file and the usb file 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.210
 that is kingston's tina key 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.520
 connected 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 let's access these files inside 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.869
 are the functions 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.970
 sorry the files I have inside we try 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.970
 maybe to play a video 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 so what this video is now 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.130
 reproduced by the key is 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.690
 absolutely no problems 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 because to what things his visit 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.180
 it will be something else to use 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.830
 this key first if 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.630
 we have to make backups we have memory 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.360
 full we have a smartphone with little 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.880
 memory immediately ready away 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.530
 let's download the pictures that the pictures 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.230
 we have taken and we copy dinners in the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.000
 in memory or vice versa we can 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.130
 transfer files from our pc to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.260
 our smartphone simply and in a 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.680
 moment we copy the files with the usb and the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.690
 we connect to our device 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.540
 everything happens to say very fast 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.940
 using usb 2.0 is not yet at 3.0 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.980
 however the data transfer really a lot 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.670
 I will show you for example the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.940
 transfer of a folder we do 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.480
 couple internal archive 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.760
 ok as you can see there was the folder with 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.500
 in three rows 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.720
 I chose just the least file e 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.850
 let's try again 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:29.890
 let's talk with these copy internal arqiva 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.270
 ok you saw that everything really is 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.710
 very easy 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.660
 the important thing that before 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.810
 always disconnect better to use 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.270
 the system we always say of the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.330
 smartphone to disconnect and disassemble 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.800
 the usb archive this works with the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.630
 Most LG Smartphones 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.550
 also works with most 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.720
 of samsung smartphones I make you 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.530
 also see his quickly 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.180
 working with a galaxy note 3 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.710
 we connect well there are between you and 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.570
 Acsi night between once connected 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.630
 tells us USB connector connected and there 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.680
 the publisher opens immediately 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.030
 in the file manager we say in the meantime 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.860
 all ours are displayed 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.550
 archives you see I am internal memory is 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.260
 micro sd usb drive memory and these 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.370
 are the files that are inside and now 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.370
 let's start a song 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.590
 so I really don't know a solution 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.050
 very optimal to have a solution 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.210
 very convenient and above all a solution 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.180
 which is not expensive at all because why 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.970
 the price of this device that you 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.400
 remember the kinder sport and it's called 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.640
 datatraveler micro duo is for the model 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.180
 from 16 gigabytes to around 15 euros therefore 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.430
 let's say a very good expenditure for us 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.880
 allows you to have an accessory really 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.470
 useful that we can always take with us 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.470
 a greeting from diego hello
