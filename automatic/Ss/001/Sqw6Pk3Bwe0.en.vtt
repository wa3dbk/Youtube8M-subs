 the 400 shots said henry georges clouzot 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.109
 is a movie that has positively so many years 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.779
 the most sensitive film I've seen since the war 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.759
 as to the appreciation of jean-cocteau chaos 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.859
 what was not less laudatory 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 I've never been so upset at the movies 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.550

 she continues to push the throat during the hours following this 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.760
 revelation 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.070
 a great talent we love that I greet with admiration and our respectful

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.980
 as evidenced by paul billaudeau france-soir 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.940
 the film did not win simply because it's beautiful like anything

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 I tell them things and that deserves a great instance of besanÃ§on 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.050
 the subject of this film 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.780
 everything has been so spontaneously and so generously expressed so far 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.299
 beautiful and sincere 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.299
 which tears us off the softly hear 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.939
 without criticizing without grandiloquence

 but looking for the absolute and led you right 0-2 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.999
 for others less familiar with balzac and I would say it's a 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.809
 tenebrous affair 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.899
 anyway right because there 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.779
