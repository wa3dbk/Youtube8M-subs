00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
would kind of try to get some of the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.850 
would kind of try to get some of the
elements<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.050> those<00:00:34.200> shows<00:00:34.410> they've<00:00:34.590> liked

and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.110> talking<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> some<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> drivers

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
and I was talking to some of the drivers

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.319 
and I was talking to some of the drivers
that<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:38.730> input<00:00:39.149> in

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that actually had some input in

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.360 
that actually had some input in
designing<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.079> track<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:40.860> said<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
designing this track they said that it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.459 
designing this track they said that it
actually<00:00:41.640> turned<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.390> 90<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> 92

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
actually turned out to be about 90 to 92

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.490 
actually turned out to be about 90 to 92
percent<00:00:44.270> exactly<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.289> had

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

and<00:00:57.570> conquer<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> track<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> very

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and conquer the track they do a very

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.139 
and conquer the track they do a very
good<00:00:58.949> job<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.000> like

good job we want to know what they like
what<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.480> don't<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
what they don't like what they like are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.990 
what they don't like what they like are
the<00:01:02.129> moves<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.489> set<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.850> for

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the moves that set them up for

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
the moves that set them up for
combinations<00:01:03.480> things<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.650> look<00:01:04.949> different

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
combinations things that look different

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.640 
combinations things that look different
there's<00:01:05.820> 11<00:01:06.180> different<00:01:06.330> obstacles<00:01:06.720> platforms

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there's 11 different obstacles platforms

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.469 
there's 11 different obstacles platforms
in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.740> track<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.430> 33<00:01:08.880> different<00:01:09.060> ramps

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
in the track there's 33 different ramps

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
in the track there's 33 different ramps
in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> track<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.740> gives<00:01:10.950> essentially<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in the track so that gives essentially a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.789 
in the track so that gives essentially a
lot<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> different<00:01:12.210> variables<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.290> 24

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
lot of different variables for when 24

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.590 
lot of different variables for when 24

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that brought up something that I have

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
that brought up something that I have
never<00:01:28.020> heard<00:01:28.320> before<00:01:28.369> what<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.610> behind<00:01:29.759> me

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
never heard before what we see behind me
is<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> cars<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.680> they

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
is they actually take the cars and they

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
is they actually take the cars and they
stack<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.790> vertically<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.840> basically<00:01:34.200> on

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
stack them vertically so basically on

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
stack them vertically so basically on
their<00:01:34.439> sides<00:01:34.740> instead<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
their sides instead of just on the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
their sides instead of just on the
regular<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.020> stand<00:01:37.259> tell<00:01:37.740> us<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> little

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
regular way they stand tell us a little

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.609 
regular way they stand tell us a little
bit<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.310> how<00:01:38.610> how<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.930> trucks<00:01:40.229> hit

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
bit about how how that the trucks hit

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490 
bit about how how that the trucks hit
those<00:01:40.799> differently<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.579> some<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> tricks

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
those differently and some of the tricks

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
those differently and some of the tricks
that<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that they can do off of that well it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
that they can do off of that well it's
actually<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.659> looks<00:01:45.869> almost<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.229> BMX<00:01:46.560> ramp

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
actually it looks almost like a BMX ramp

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.899 
actually it looks almost like a BMX ramp
and<00:01:46.950> we've<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.369> calling<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> jammer

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and we've been calling it the jammer

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.819 
and we've been calling it the jammer
stack<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.390> year<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.500> designed

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
stack all year and it's really designed

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.139 
stack all year and it's really designed
for<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> couple<00:01:50.430> different<00:01:50.520> things<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
for a couple different things it's a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
for a couple different things it's a
slower<00:01:51.329> speed<00:01:51.509> obstacle<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.649> of

slower speed obstacle do a lot of
different<00:01:52.829> things<00:01:53.040> off<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> vertical<00:01:53.790> pop

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
different things off with a vertical pop

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.240 
different things off with a vertical pop
good<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:54.990> slap<00:01:55.170> wheelies<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.100> back
