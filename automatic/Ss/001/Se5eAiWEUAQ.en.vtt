00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
okay this is a radiator out of a 2001

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.740 
okay this is a radiator out of a 2001
f-350<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> man<00:00:04.710> ended<00:00:05.670> up<00:00:05.819> having<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.509> put

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
f-350 that a man ended up having to put

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.850 
f-350 that a man ended up having to put
three<00:00:07.429> transmissions<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.670> okay<00:00:09.380> because<00:00:10.380> they

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
three transmissions in okay because they

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.499 
three transmissions in okay because they
kept<00:00:11.130> overheating<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.030> would<00:00:12.150> burn<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
kept overheating and it would burn the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
kept overheating and it would burn the
clutches<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.290> obviously<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.980> man

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
clutches up and obviously the man

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
clutches up and obviously the man
doesn't<00:00:14.429> know<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:14.880> he's<00:00:15.000> doing

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
doesn't know what he's doing

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.410

radiator was covered with this stuff and
you<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> transmission<00:00:34.380> guy<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.489> as

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you know the transmission guy is just as

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
you know the transmission guy is just as
guilty<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.270> he<00:00:36.719> should<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.020> checked

the damn radiator finally the radiator

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.209 
the damn radiator finally the radiator
shuttled<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> blew<00:00:41.160> up

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
goes into the radiator here actually

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.049 
goes into the radiator here actually
created<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.250> pressure<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:47.969> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
got a cooling problem the thing that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
got a cooling problem the thing that

they never checked the radiator

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.050 
they never checked the radiator

shape<00:01:56.310> wait<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.000> don't<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
shape wait you don't think the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.940 
shape wait you don't think the
transmission<00:01:58.020> builder<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> cry

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
transmission builder is about to cry

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
transmission builder is about to cry
because<00:01:59.159> he's<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.909> only<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.390> he<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.869> made

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
because he's not only has he not made

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.840 
because he's not only has he not made
profit<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.619> lost<00:02:01.950> money<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.579> deal

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
profit he lost money on this deal

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.219 
profit he lost money on this deal
there's<00:02:03.450> no<00:02:03.600> way<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.020> build<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
there's no way you can build a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
there's no way you can build a
transmission<00:02:04.619> three<00:02:04.950> times<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.369> make<00:02:05.490> money

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
transmission three times and make money

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
transmission three times and make money
so<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.049> care<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.380> truck<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.799> takes

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
so you take care of your truck it takes

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
so you take care of your truck it takes
care<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.060> don't<00:02:09.360> take<00:02:09.539> care<00:02:09.599> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
care of you if you don't take care of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
care of you if you don't take care of
