the syrups and stuff compared to just

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.550 
the syrups and stuff compared to just
blasting<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> stuff<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:35.230> could<00:02:35.380> make

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
blasting the stuff in so you could make

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.250 
blasting the stuff in so you could make
yours<00:02:35.830> into<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> mix<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.180> could<00:02:37.630> make<00:02:37.810> mine<00:02:37.990> into

yours into a mix I could make mine into
a<00:02:38.290> mix<00:02:38.530> but<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.920> kind<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.520> makes<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.360> less

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
a mix but that kind of makes it less

in<00:03:49.180> there<00:03:49.360> but<00:03:49.540> okay

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
in there but okay

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.150 
in there but okay
we're<00:03:50.260> gonna<00:03:50.350> shake<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.590> up<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.920> see<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.070> it

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
we're gonna shake it up and see if it

00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:07.850 
we're gonna shake it up and see if it
breaks

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.960 

and<00:04:08.860> you're<00:04:08.980> like<00:04:09.099> why<00:04:09.280> was<00:04:09.459> he<00:04:09.549> shaking<00:04:09.730> it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
and you're like why was he shaking it

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.030 
and you're like why was he shaking it
that<00:04:10.120> long<00:04:10.330> I'm<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:11.170> taking<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.620> while<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.769> get

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
that long I'm just taking a while to get

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.149 
that long I'm just taking a while to get
chilled<00:04:12.340> there's<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.030> lot<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.269> liquid<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.599> there

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
chilled there's a lot of liquid in there

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.409 
chilled there's a lot of liquid in there
so<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.280> theory<00:04:15.579> is<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.909> more<00:04:16.090> ice<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.389> have

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
so the theory is the more ice you have

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.340 
so the theory is the more ice you have
the<00:04:16.780> better<00:04:16.900> chance<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.290> it's<00:04:17.500> gonna<00:04:17.620> break

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.670 

you<00:04:21.100> know<00:04:21.190> just<00:04:21.449> cuz<00:04:22.449> this<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> don't<00:04:23.530> every

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
you know just cuz this I don't every

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.230 
you know just cuz this I don't every
time<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:23.949> film<00:04:24.160> Shuai<00:04:24.400> they<00:04:24.729> become<00:04:25.030> really

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
time I film Shuai they become really

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.060 
time I film Shuai they become really
hard<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.690> create<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.530> seal

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
hard to create that seal

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.560 
hard to create that seal
oh<00:04:27.100> we're<00:04:27.880> also<00:04:28.000> gonna<00:04:28.150> do<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.389> on<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.600> rocks

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
oh we're also gonna do this on the rocks

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.510 
oh we're also gonna do this on the rocks
now<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:32.110> probably<00:04:32.380> want<00:04:32.710> these<00:04:32.860> crushed<00:04:33.280> ice

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
now you probably want these crushed ice

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.090 
now you probably want these crushed ice
I<00:04:33.760> used<00:04:34.090> all<00:04:34.300> mine<00:04:34.949> and<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:36.130> private<00:04:36.550> recipe<00:04:38.100> and

I used all mine and a private recipe and

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.590 
I used all mine and a private recipe and
it<00:04:39.190> goes<00:04:39.340> back<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.639> that<00:04:39.760> planning<00:04:40.120> ahead<00:04:40.210> part

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
it goes back to that planning ahead part

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.219 
it goes back to that planning ahead part
back<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.710> planning<00:04:42.070> ahead<00:04:42.960> whoa<00:04:43.960> that

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
layer maybe two and a half smells like a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.920 
layer maybe two and a half smells like a
margarita<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:56.410> it's<00:04:56.590> good

acidity

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
acidity

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.679 
acidity
they'll<00:05:51.679> try<00:05:51.949> say<00:05:52.159> like<00:05:52.999> you<00:05:53.089> get<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.360> acidity

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
they'll try say like you get the acidity

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.809 
they'll try say like you get the acidity
when<00:05:53.869> you<00:05:53.959> turn<00:05:54.139> it's<00:05:54.319> like<00:05:54.439> lemonade<00:05:54.830> you're

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
when you turn it's like lemonade you're

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:59.469 
when you turn it's like lemonade you're
getting<00:05:56.029> that<00:05:56.119> acidity<00:05:56.569> so<00:05:58.179> you're<00:05:59.179> getting

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
getting that acidity so you're getting

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.059 
getting that acidity so you're getting
what<00:05:59.629> tastes<00:06:00.019> like<00:06:00.139> somebody<00:06:00.499> to<00:06:00.619> squeeze<00:06:00.919> the

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
what tastes like somebody to squeeze the

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.249 
what tastes like somebody to squeeze the
lime<00:06:01.279> in<00:06:01.459> here<00:06:01.699> so<00:06:02.300> that's<00:06:02.509> good<00:06:02.749> that's<00:06:02.929> kind

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
lime in here so that's good that's kind

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.869 
lime in here so that's good that's kind
of<00:06:03.319> key<00:06:03.499> because<00:06:03.709> if<00:06:03.919> it's<00:06:04.099> not<00:06:04.189> sour<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:04.819> it

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
of key because if it's not sour and it

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.359 
of key because if it's not sour and it
ends<00:06:05.059> up<00:06:05.119> being<00:06:05.330> sweet<00:06:05.809> over<00:06:06.259> sweet<00:06:06.559> then<00:06:07.219> it's

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:07.369 
ends up being sweet over sweet then it's

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.579 
ends up being sweet over sweet then it's
gonna<00:06:07.459> seem<00:06:07.909> a<00:06:07.939> little<00:06:08.029> fake<00:06:08.449> unless<00:06:09.139> you<00:06:09.289> just

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
gonna seem a little fake unless you just

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:10.929 
gonna seem a little fake unless you just
put<00:06:09.709> a<00:06:09.740> lot<00:06:09.889> of<00:06:10.009> agave<00:06:10.399> nectar<00:06:10.429> in<00:06:10.819> there

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
put a lot of agave nectar in there

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:17.499 
put a lot of agave nectar in there
that's<00:06:11.119> always<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.330> good<00:06:11.449> time<00:06:15.939> besides<00:06:16.939> the

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
that's always a good time besides the

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.519 
that's always a good time besides the
fact<00:06:17.689> that<00:06:17.779> there's<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.050> lot<00:06:18.199> of<00:06:18.289> high<00:06:18.379> fructose

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
fact that there's a lot of high fructose

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:23.109 
fact that there's a lot of high fructose
corn<00:06:18.830> syrup<00:06:19.069> I<00:06:20.289> like<00:06:21.309> the<00:06:22.309> simplicity<00:06:22.610> of<00:06:22.939> it

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:23.119 
corn syrup I like the simplicity of it

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.029 
corn syrup I like the simplicity of it
and<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.689> keeps<00:06:23.959> the<00:06:24.169> Cavallino<00:06:24.649> coming

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
and it keeps the Cavallino coming

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.389 
and it keeps the Cavallino coming
through<00:06:25.339> you're<00:06:25.939> getting<00:06:26.179> some<00:06:26.330> in<00:06:26.419> that<00:06:26.539> raw

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
gonna be better but if you're looking

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.420 
gonna be better but if you're looking
for<00:06:48.439> an<00:06:48.529> alternative<00:06:49.009> where<00:06:49.129> people<00:06:49.369> don't

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
for an alternative where people don't
