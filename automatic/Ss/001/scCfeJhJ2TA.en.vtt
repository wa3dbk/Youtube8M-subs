in<00:00:13.519> this<00:00:14.519> video<00:00:14.820> I'm<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.330> teach<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
in this video I'm going to teach you a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
in this video I'm going to teach you a
trick<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.410> discovered<00:00:16.980> while<00:00:17.190> writing<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
trick I discovered while writing the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.420 
trick I discovered while writing the
book<00:00:17.880> which<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> rotation<00:00:19.619> trick<00:00:19.890> from<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
book which is a rotation trick from the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.480 
book which is a rotation trick from the
diagram<00:00:21.500> first<00:00:22.500> let's<00:00:22.769> review<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
diagram first let's review how you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390 
diagram first let's review how you
multiply<00:00:23.820> numbers<00:00:24.150> by<00:00:24.689> drawing<00:00:24.960> lines<00:00:25.400> let's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
multiply numbers by drawing lines let's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.710 
multiply numbers by drawing lines let's
say<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> multiply<00:00:27.119> 12<00:00:27.510> by<00:00:28.260> 13<00:00:29.720> for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
say you want to multiply 12 by 13 for

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.970 
say you want to multiply 12 by 13 for
the<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.439> 12<00:00:31.890> we'll<00:00:32.610> draw<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.149> line<00:00:33.980> for

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the one in 12 we'll draw one line for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
the one in 12 we'll draw one line for
the<00:00:35.100> two<00:00:35.370> we'll<00:00:36.270> leave<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:37.079> bit<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the two we'll leave a little bit of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.000 
the two we'll leave a little bit of
space<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> draw<00:00:38.340> two<00:00:38.579> lines<00:00:39.739> for<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> other

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
space and draw two lines for the other

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400 
space and draw two lines for the other
number<00:00:41.550> we'll<00:00:42.300> draw<00:00:42.570> lines<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.230> other

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
number we'll draw lines in the other

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.750 
number we'll draw lines in the other
direction<00:00:47.510> now<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.899> group<00:00:49.320> up

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
direction now we will group up

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.630 
direction now we will group up
intersections<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.239> lines<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.370> far

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
intersections of the lines on the far

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
intersections of the lines on the far
right<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.690> six<00:00:55.160> intersections<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:57.559> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
right there are six intersections in the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.420 
right there are six intersections in the
middle<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.309> five<00:00:59.789> intersections<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
middle there are five intersections and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.980 
middle there are five intersections and
on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> left<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.660> intersection

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
on the left there's one intersection

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
on the left there's one intersection
these<00:01:06.990> numbers<00:01:07.560> tell<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> answer

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
these numbers tell you what the answer

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
these numbers tell you what the answer
is<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.240> 12<00:01:09.960> times<00:01:10.470> 13<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.750> 156<00:01:15.200> but<00:01:16.200> there's<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is so 12 times 13 is 156 but there's a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
is so 12 times 13 is 156 but there's a
cool<00:01:16.770> thing<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.210> draw

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
cool thing you can do now that you draw

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.280 
cool thing you can do now that you draw
in<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> diagram<00:01:20.360> let's<00:01:21.360> remove<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
in the diagram let's remove some of the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.859 
in the diagram let's remove some of the
labels<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:25.880> what<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
labels now what we're going to do is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.340 
labels now what we're going to do is
rotate<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.650> entire<00:01:29.250> diagram<00:01:29.869> 90<00:01:30.869> degrees

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
rotate this entire diagram 90 degrees

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.850 
rotate this entire diagram 90 degrees
and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> discovered<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
and the thing I discovered is that you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.330 
and the thing I discovered is that you
now<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.759> new<00:01:36.240> diagram<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.040> solve

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
now get a new diagram and this can solve

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.499 
now get a new diagram and this can solve
a<00:01:38.549> new<00:01:38.909> multiplication<00:01:39.840> problem<00:01:41.329> let's<00:01:42.329> look

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
a new multiplication problem let's look

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.200 
a new multiplication problem let's look
at<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> lines<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> upper

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
at the lines that are going to the upper

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.899 
at the lines that are going to the upper
right<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.840> line<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:50.700> we

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
right here we have one line and then we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
right here we have one line and then we
have<00:01:51.030> three<00:01:51.390> lines<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.740> means<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> first

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
have three lines so that means the first

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
have three lines so that means the first
number<00:01:54.119> we're<00:01:54.360> multiplying<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:55.259> 13<00:01:57.500> for<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
number we're multiplying is 13 for the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.520 
number we're multiplying is 13 for the
lines<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.460> direction<00:02:00.079> we<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.259> two

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
lines in the other direction we have two

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.039 
lines in the other direction we have two
lines<00:02:01.829> followed<00:02:02.610> by<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.030> line<00:02:03.270> which

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
lines followed by one line which

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.999 
lines followed by one line which
represents<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> number<00:02:05.159> 21<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.649> diagram

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
represents the number 21 so this diagram

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.730 
represents the number 21 so this diagram
represents<00:02:08.899> 13<00:02:09.899> times<00:02:10.470> 21<00:02:11.599> we<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.810> again

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
represents 13 times 21 we can again

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.440 
represents 13 times 21 we can again
group<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.250> intersections<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.390> are

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
group the intersections that are

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.770 
group the intersections that are
vertically<00:02:15.990> aligned<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.120> three<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
vertically aligned we have three on the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.010 
vertically aligned we have three on the
right<00:02:19.190> seven<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.460> center<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.060> two<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
right seven in the center and two on the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.830 
right seven in the center and two on the
left<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:23.730> gives<00:02:23.970> us<00:02:24.090> our<00:02:24.240> answer<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
left and that gives us our answer that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.080 
left and that gives us our answer that
13<00:02:25.350> times<00:02:25.740> 21<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:27.590> 273<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.820> really

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
13 times 21 is 273 and this is really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.110 
13 times 21 is 273 and this is really
cool<00:02:30.450> we've<00:02:30.810> solved<00:02:31.350> another<00:02:31.800> problem<00:02:32.120> from

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
cool we've solved another problem from

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.220 
cool we've solved another problem from
the<00:02:33.300> same<00:02:33.570> diagram<00:02:34.140> we've<00:02:34.440> already<00:02:34.710> drawn<00:02:36.230> but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the same diagram we've already drawn but

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.830 
the same diagram we've already drawn but
we<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.530> even<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.890> more<00:02:38.030> let's<00:02:39.030> go<00:02:39.300> ahead<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
we can even do more let's go ahead and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.770 
we can even do more let's go ahead and
rotate<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.470> diagram<00:02:41.040> by<00:02:41.550> 90<00:02:41.970> degrees<00:02:42.300> once

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
rotate this diagram by 90 degrees once

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.110 
rotate this diagram by 90 degrees once
more<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.840> new<00:02:46.260> diagram<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.280> we

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
more we now have a new diagram and we

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.610 
more we now have a new diagram and we
can<00:02:48.300> solve<00:02:48.510> another<00:02:49.110> multiplication<00:02:49.710> problem

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
can solve another multiplication problem

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.290 
can solve another multiplication problem
the<00:02:52.620> lines<00:02:52.890> going<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:53.370> into<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> right<00:02:54.030> are

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
the lines going up into the right are

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.960 
the lines going up into the right are
two<00:02:54.360> lines<00:02:54.990> followed<00:02:55.530> by<00:02:55.680> one<00:02:55.920> line<00:02:56.160> which<00:02:56.790> is

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
two lines followed by one line which is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.950 
two lines followed by one line which is
21<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.850> lines<00:02:59.850> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> bottom<00:03:00.750> right

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
21 the lines going to the bottom right

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.150 
21 the lines going to the bottom right
are<00:03:01.710> three<00:03:02.190> lines<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.930> one<00:03:04.170> line<00:03:04.380> so

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
are three lines and then one line so

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.410 
are three lines and then one line so
that's<00:03:05.370> 31<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.350> diagram<00:03:07.650> represents<00:03:08.550> 21

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
that's 31 so this diagram represents 21

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.300 
that's 31 so this diagram represents 21
times<00:03:09.930> 31<00:03:11.750> will<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:12.930> count<00:03:13.230> up<00:03:13.560> vertically

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
times 31 will now count up vertically

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.780 
times 31 will now count up vertically
aligned<00:03:15.080> intersections<00:03:16.080> there's<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
aligned intersections there's one on the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.530 
aligned intersections there's one on the
right<00:03:18.030> five<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.350> center<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:19.920> six<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
right five in the center and six on the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.450 
right five in the center and six on the
left<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.400> means<00:03:23.730> 21<00:03:24.480> times<00:03:24.870> 31<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:26.120> 651

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
left so that means 21 times 31 is 651

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.310 
left so that means 21 times 31 is 651
we're<00:03:29.460> not<00:03:29.640> done<00:03:29.820> yet<00:03:29.850> we<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.570> do<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.900> one

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
we're not done yet we can do this one

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.610 
we're not done yet we can do this one
more<00:03:31.620> time<00:03:32.120> we'll<00:03:33.120> rotate<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.750> diagram<00:03:34.200> 90

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
more time we'll rotate the diagram 90

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.130 
more time we'll rotate the diagram 90
degrees<00:03:35.120> now<00:03:36.120> there's<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.450> pattern<00:03:36.750> each<00:03:37.110> time

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
degrees now there's a pattern each time

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.520 
degrees now there's a pattern each time
you<00:03:37.620> rotate<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.190> diagram<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.420> turns<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:40.050> that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
you rotate the diagram it turns out that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.110 
you rotate the diagram it turns out that
you're<00:03:40.710> going<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:40.980> switch<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.550> two<00:03:41.730> numbers

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
you're going to switch the two numbers

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240 
you're going to switch the two numbers
and<00:03:42.330> switch<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.230> digits<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.860> second

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and switch the digits in the second

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.150 
and switch the digits in the second
number<00:03:44.550> but<00:03:45.540> let's<00:03:45.570> go<00:03:45.930> ahead<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.410> count<00:03:46.770> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
number but let's go ahead and count the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.930 
number but let's go ahead and count the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
the right are 1 followed by 2 which is

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.380 
the right are 1 followed by 2 which is
12<00:04:00.590> we<00:04:01.590> now<00:04:01.770> count<00:04:02.160> up<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.430> intersections

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
12 we now count up the intersections

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.710 
12 we now count up the intersections
there's<00:04:03.930> two<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> right<00:04:04.940> 7<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.300> center

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
there's two on the right 7 in the center

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.970 
there's two on the right 7 in the center
and<00:04:06.950> 3<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.340> left<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.420> we<00:04:09.540> have<00:04:09.630> 31<00:04:10.050> times<00:04:10.590> 12

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
and 3 on the left so we have 31 times 12

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.820 
and 3 on the left so we have 31 times 12
is<00:04:11.930> 372<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:14.240> we<00:04:15.240> rotate<00:04:15.690> one<00:04:15.930> more<00:04:16.140> time<00:04:16.380> we're

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
is 372 if we rotate one more time we're

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.860 
is 372 if we rotate one more time we're
back<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.430> our<00:04:17.459> original<00:04:17.730> problem<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.780> 12<00:04:19.140> by<00:04:19.350> 13

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.260 
on
you<00:04:27.180> orient<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.520> it's<00:04:29.520> really<00:04:29.730> amazing

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
you orient it so it's really amazing

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.200 
you orient it so it's really amazing

this<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.820> first<00:04:42.120> time<00:04:42.480> that<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.110> video<00:04:43.350> has

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
this is the first time that a video has

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.070 
this is the first time that a video has
been<00:04:43.770> made<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.610> show<00:04:44.880> you<00:04:44.940> how<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.540> can<00:04:45.810> rotate

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
been made to show you how you can rotate

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.020 
been made to show you how you can rotate
the<00:04:46.530> diagram<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.190> solve<00:04:47.850> other<00:04:48.150> problems<00:04:50.030> so

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
the diagram and solve other problems so

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.660 
the diagram and solve other problems so
this<00:04:51.240> connects<00:04:51.660> geometry<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.710> arithmetic<00:04:52.950> in

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
this connects geometry and arithmetic in

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.610 
this connects geometry and arithmetic in
a<00:04:53.850> completely<00:04:54.390> unsurprising<00:04:55.050> way<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.380> it's<00:04:58.530> a

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
a completely unsurprising way so it's a

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.590 
a completely unsurprising way so it's a
cool<00:04:58.830> trick<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.310> hope<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.760> like<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.300> please
