00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
propeller yourself I made made all this

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.280 
propeller yourself I made made all this
stuff<00:01:32.040> yep<00:01:32.550> okay<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.210> start<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
stuff yep okay you start out with just a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
stuff yep okay you start out with just a
sheet<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> balsa<00:01:35.010> wood<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:36.150> paper<00:01:36.360> and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sheet of balsa wood and some paper and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.340 
sheet of balsa wood and some paper and
glue<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> together

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
glue it together

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
glue it together
how<00:01:37.500> long<00:01:37.680> does<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.190> make

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
how long does it take you to make

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.890 
how long does it take you to make
something<00:01:38.730> like<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.880> something<00:01:39.480> like<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
something like that something like this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
something like that something like this
might<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.560> four<00:01:40.830> or<00:01:40.920> five<00:01:41.100> hours<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
might take four or five hours but the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.969 
might take four or five hours but the
really<00:01:42.450> extreme<00:01:42.840> stuff<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.380> take<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.680> many<00:01:43.830> as

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
really extreme stuff can take as many as

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.640 
really extreme stuff can take as many as
like<00:01:44.580> 40<00:01:45.030> hours<00:01:45.060> working<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.350> how<00:01:46.530> much

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
like 40 hours working on it and how much

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.260 
like 40 hours working on it and how much
does<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:46.860> weigh<00:01:47.160> you<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:47.729> discussed<00:01:48.120> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
does that weigh you and I discussed it
