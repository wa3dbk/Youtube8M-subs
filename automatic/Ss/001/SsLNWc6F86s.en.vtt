00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
they're portable what I have seen some

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.360 
they're portable what I have seen some
people<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.660> they<00:04:22.350> fold<00:04:22.650> them<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.100> way

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
people do is they fold them in this way

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.600 
people do is they fold them in this way
and<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:25.260> wouldn't<00:04:25.560> recommend<00:04:25.800> folding<00:04:26.310> them<00:04:26.460> in

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
and I wouldn't recommend folding them in

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.240 
and I wouldn't recommend folding them in
that<00:04:26.820> way<00:04:26.850> mainly<00:04:27.780> because<00:04:27.810> your<00:04:28.620> designs

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
that way mainly because your designs

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.980 
that way mainly because your designs
will<00:04:29.520> end<00:04:29.850> up<00:04:29.970> scratching<00:04:30.330> together<00:04:30.810> and

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
will end up scratching together and

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.660 
will end up scratching together and
maybe<00:04:31.110> scratch<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.920> have<00:04:32.250> heard<00:04:32.400> some

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
maybe scratch I have heard some

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.100 
maybe scratch I have heard some
complaints<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.270> people<00:04:33.600> scratching<00:04:33.930> their

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
complaints of people scratching their

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.470 
complaints of people scratching their
logos<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.830> I'm<00:04:35.460> guessing<00:04:35.820> that's<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.120> reason

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
logos and I'm guessing that's the reason

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.780 
logos and I'm guessing that's the reason
why<00:04:36.890> but<00:04:37.890> when<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.100> put<00:04:38.130> them<00:04:38.340> like<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.580> your

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
why but when you put them like this your

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.100 
why but when you put them like this your
cushions<00:04:39.150> are<00:04:39.270> hitting<00:04:39.540> each<00:04:39.660> other<00:04:39.780> and

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
cushions are hitting each other and

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.160 
cushions are hitting each other and
nothing's<00:04:40.830> going<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.070> happen<00:04:42.110> now<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
nothing's going to happen now the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.460 
nothing's going to happen now the
cushions<00:04:43.710> themselves<00:04:44.400> are<00:04:44.870> very<00:04:45.870> comfortable

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
cushions themselves are very comfortable

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.220 
cushions themselves are very comfortable
they're<00:04:46.920> very<00:04:47.070> soft<00:04:47.460> very<00:04:47.580> cushiony<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.870> would

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
they're very soft very cushiony I would

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.780 
they're very soft very cushiony I would
have<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.530> say<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.950> they<00:04:50.160> do<00:04:50.220> take<00:04:50.550> some

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
have to say that they do take some

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.310 
have to say that they do take some
getting<00:04:51.090> used<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.510> though<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:52.050> admit

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
getting used to though I would admit

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.110 
getting used to though I would admit
that<00:04:52.500> when<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.680> put<00:04:52.920> them<00:04:53.040> on<00:04:53.160> initially<00:04:53.640> they

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
that when I put them on initially they

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.060 
that when I put them on initially they
didn't<00:04:54.360> feel<00:04:54.510> too<00:04:54.540> comfortable<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.470> I'm

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
didn't feel too comfortable and I'm

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.200 
didn't feel too comfortable and I'm
guessing<00:04:56.220> that<00:04:56.550> was<00:04:56.640> because<00:04:56.730> I've<00:04:56.970> never

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
guessing that was because I've never

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.150 
guessing that was because I've never
been<00:04:57.390> used<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.780> over<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.320> ear<00:04:58.500> cushions<00:04:59.010> but

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
been used to over the ear cushions but

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.280 
been used to over the ear cushions but
after<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.550> while<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.060> if<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.720> adjust<00:05:01.110> them

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
after a while and if you adjust them

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.230 
after a while and if you adjust them
right<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:02.610> will<00:05:02.760> find<00:05:03.000> them<00:05:03.210> very

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
right you will find them very

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.730 
right you will find them very
comfortable<00:05:03.900> they<00:05:04.050> don't<00:05:04.200> bother<00:05:04.350> you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
comfortable they don't bother you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.560 
comfortable they don't bother you
basically<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.670> need<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.030> break<00:05:06.240> them<00:05:06.420> in

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
basically you just need to break them in

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.450 
basically you just need to break them in
and<00:05:06.720> get<00:05:06.810> used<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.230> them<00:05:07.380> now<00:05:07.560> they<00:05:08.010> do<00:05:08.070> feature

overall<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.599> sound<00:06:06.840> quality<00:06:06.960> was<00:06:07.139> pretty

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
overall the sound quality was pretty

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.860 
overall the sound quality was pretty
good<00:06:07.650> on<00:06:07.830> these<00:06:08.009> and<00:06:08.280> they<00:06:08.909> do<00:06:08.969> future<00:06:09.479> 40

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
good on these and they do future 40

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.510 
good on these and they do future 40
millimeter<00:06:10.229> drive<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:10.800> they<00:06:10.949> do<00:06:11.009> get<00:06:11.310> loud

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
millimeter drive so they do get loud
