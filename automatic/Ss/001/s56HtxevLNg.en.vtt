some weight off the counter weights of
this<00:00:17.100> big-block<00:00:17.910> Chevy<00:00:18.500> crankshaft<00:00:21.050> hi<00:00:22.050> John

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this big-block Chevy crankshaft hi John

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.700 
this big-block Chevy crankshaft hi John
from<00:00:22.619> close<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:22.949> sardine<00:00:23.490> well<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:25.170> just

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
from close to my sardine well as I just

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.700 
from close to my sardine well as I just
said<00:00:26.220> you're<00:00:26.699> probably<00:00:26.939> wondering<00:00:27.330> why<00:00:27.449> we're

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
said you're probably wondering why we're

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.660 
said you're probably wondering why we're
taking<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:28.890> weight<00:00:29.010> off<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.400> counter

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
taking some weight off these counter

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.110 
taking some weight off these counter
weights<00:00:30.170> we've<00:00:31.170> actually<00:00:31.410> got<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.090> bore<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
weights we've actually got a bore and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.270 
weights we've actually got a bore and
Stroke<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.899> rod<00:00:34.140> length<00:00:34.380> combination<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
Stroke and rod length combination that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.430 
Stroke and rod length combination that
means<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> remove<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.780> 400

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
means that we have to remove about 400

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.889 
means that we have to remove about 400
grams<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:38.210> weight<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> counter

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
grams of weight off of the counter

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.220 
grams of weight off of the counter
weights<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.649> crankshaft<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
weights on this crankshaft because the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
weights on this crankshaft because the
connecting<00:00:43.230> rods<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.620> 200<00:00:44.040> well<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.000> two

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
connecting rods are 200 well it's two

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.410 
connecting rods are 200 well it's two
hundred<00:00:45.270> thousands<00:00:46.640> extra<00:00:47.640> long<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
hundred thousands extra long on the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.720 
hundred thousands extra long on the
length<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> four<00:00:49.980> hundred<00:00:50.070> thousand<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
length or is a four hundred thousand so

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
length or is a four hundred thousand so
whatever<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.360> anyway<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.710> happened<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
whatever it is anyway what happened to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
whatever it is anyway what happened to
do<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.879> modification<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.230> can

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
do this modification so that we can

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
do this modification so that we can
actually<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.920> thing<00:00:55.980> balanced<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:57.329> put

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
actually get this thing balanced we put

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
actually get this thing balanced we put
it<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> balance<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.350> came<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.559> with

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it on the balance and we came up with

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.660 
it on the balance and we came up with
about<00:00:58.920> 400<00:00:59.550> grams<00:00:59.670> out<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> balance<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.670> by

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
about 400 grams out of balance so by

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
about 400 grams out of balance so by
removing<00:01:03.000> weight<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> make

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
removing weight here it's going to make

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
removing weight here it's going to make
it<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.100> easier<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> corrections

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it much easier to make the corrections

00:01:06.390 --> 00:02:49.210 
it much easier to make the corrections
on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> machine<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.439> to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.559 

alright<00:02:50.220> well<00:02:50.370> here's<00:02:50.550> our<00:02:50.730> crank<00:02:51.090> after

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
alright well here's our crank after

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.720 
alright well here's our crank after
we've<00:02:51.810> balanced<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> thing<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.610> can

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
we've balanced the thing and as you can

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.220 
we've balanced the thing and as you can
see<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.120> didn't<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.600> take<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.990> whole

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
see we didn't have to take out a whole

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.410 
see we didn't have to take out a whole
lot<00:02:55.410> they<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.700> take<00:02:56.819> out<00:02:56.970> quite<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.240> bit

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
lot they have to take out quite a bit

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.059 
lot they have to take out quite a bit
but<00:02:57.600> not<00:02:57.990> as<00:02:58.140> much<00:02:58.319> as<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.650> would<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:59.010> we

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
but not as much as we would have if we

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.890 
but not as much as we would have if we
had<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.370> take<00:02:59.490> full<00:02:59.760> 400<00:03:00.239> grams<00:03:00.480> off<00:03:00.720> this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
had to take full 400 grams off this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.630 
had to take full 400 grams off this
thing

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.620 

anyway<00:03:10.640> if<00:03:10.850> you<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.120> questions<00:03:11.540> about

anyway if you have questions about

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.090 
anyway if you have questions about
