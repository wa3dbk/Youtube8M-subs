00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
refocus there without a doubt it seems

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.979 
refocus there without a doubt it seems
that<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.940> need<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.270> nights<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.690> score

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
that you need to have nights we score

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.690 
that you need to have nights we score
plenty<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.500> girls<00:02:20.709> or<00:02:20.950> struggle<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.430> get<00:02:21.520> any

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
plenty of girls or struggle to get any

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.030 
plenty of girls or struggle to get any
goals<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.050> probably<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.500> pattern

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
goals and that probably that pattern

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.800 
goals and that probably that pattern
probably<00:02:24.340> falls<00:02:24.550> against<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.970> higher<00:02:25.510> teams

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
probably falls against the higher teams

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.970 
probably falls against the higher teams
and<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.080> lower<00:02:26.230> teams<00:02:26.560> why<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.890> think

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
and the lower teams why do you think

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.199 
and the lower teams why do you think
that<00:02:27.069> is<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.489> just<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.819> difference<00:02:28.090> in

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
that is is it just a difference in

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.910 
that is is it just a difference in
styles<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.870> other<00:02:29.019> teams<00:02:29.230> now<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> think

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
styles that the other teams now I think

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.100 
styles that the other teams now I think
you<00:02:30.790> know<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.120> all<00:02:31.239> fairness<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.750> think<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
you know in all fairness I think the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.050 
you know in all fairness I think the
goaltender<00:02:32.620> was<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.769> big<00:02:32.950> reason<00:02:33.100> why<00:02:33.310> millions

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
goaltender was a big reason why millions

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.840 
goaltender was a big reason why millions
court<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.690> made<00:02:35.050> some<00:02:35.200> terrific<00:02:35.440> saves<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
court and I made some terrific saves and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.000 
court and I made some terrific saves and
I<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.840> know<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.019> look<00:02:38.230> at<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.500> if<00:02:38.620> two

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
I think you know you look at it if two

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.650 
I think you know you look at it if two
or<00:02:39.040> three<00:02:39.310> four<00:02:39.519> of<00:02:39.610> them<00:02:39.700> chances<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.239> fallen

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
or three four of them chances are fallen

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.229

much<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.100> that<00:03:51.640> doesn't<00:03:52.390> change<00:03:52.420> my

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
much in it and that doesn't change my

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.710
