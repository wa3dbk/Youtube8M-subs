00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:23.110
 This Levin has another balance that we have made since the beginning of development 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.450
 that is 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:32.290
 Put this front hook on the front and use it in reverse 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:39.100
 It will be used in reverse mode 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 As a feature of this reverse mode, parallel posture is set in this regular setting. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:50.270
 Slightly in order to keep horizontal attitude long 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:56.820
 The distance to the rear heavy can be extended explosively when the weight comes backward 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 And since the top and the back are in, the front draining becomes better 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 While the regular setting keeps the range firmly and swims tenaciously 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.020
 Reverse mode 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.460
 You will be able to drain the shallow range tight well 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.620
 And 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.720
 This role of finkier is regular 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.120
 If you give the slalom action to the left and right tenaciously 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.140
 And while the swim 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.140
 This is to 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.049
 Stabilize tight, high pitch swim 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.049
 It changes to the work of keel 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.650
 As a valid usage situation of this reverse mode 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 Huh 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:51.659
 Throw away a large shallow area 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:57.520
 And long cast at the time the ball is out in the distance or invite the fish in the swim of placing the year shallow range in the rise 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.590
 I think that it can be used very effectively to invite in the surface 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.370
 this 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.570
 Keep the range firmly in the regular setting 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.430
 a 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.340
 Good on the water 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:17.450
 swimming 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:20.980
 It can be used widely from how to show and invite to how to throw away and invite the surface with tight pitch 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.830
 In the form of a sinking pencil 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 This Levin and Yuri will be developed
