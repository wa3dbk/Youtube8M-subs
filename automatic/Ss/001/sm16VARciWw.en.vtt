00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.779 
liner up started anyway what a mess you
could<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.890> thing<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.189> built<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.730> was

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
could see how this thing is built it was

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.170 
could see how this thing is built it was
built<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.179> two-by-six<00:00:31.489> to<00:00:32.489> put<00:00:32.669> sixes<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
built out of two-by-six to put sixes and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.639 
built out of two-by-six to put sixes and
then<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.530> uses<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> 7<00:00:37.230> 16<00:00:37.620> 10

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
then we uses we use it we use a 7 16 10

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.270 
then we uses we use it we use a 7 16 10
inch<00:00:38.070> plywood<00:00:38.989> 716<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.070> board

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
inch plywood 716 like that way for board

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
inch plywood 716 like that way for board
stuff<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.879> half<00:00:42.210> inch<00:00:42.480> whatever<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.140> can

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
stuff or half inch whatever you can

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
stuff or half inch whatever you can
usefully<00:00:43.590> quarter<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.250> might<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.579> using<00:00:44.789> at

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
usefully quarter we might be using at

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.990 
usefully quarter we might be using at
this<00:00:45.210> time<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> wall<00:00:47.370> inside<00:00:47.730> wall

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this time and then as a wall inside wall

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
this time and then as a wall inside wall
and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.450> use<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.020> cell<00:00:49.230> text<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.770> half

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and then we use the cell text at half

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.240 
and then we use the cell text at half
inch<00:00:50.219> styrofoam<00:00:50.969> board<00:00:51.270> next<00:00:52.199> inside<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
inch styrofoam board next inside of that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
inch styrofoam board next inside of that
and<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.820> also<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> floor<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and we also put that on the floor I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
and we also put that on the floor I
think<00:00:55.170> I've<00:00:55.289> doubled<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> fourth<00:00:56.340> made

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
think I've doubled up on the fourth made

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.029 
think I've doubled up on the fourth made
it<00:00:57.030> salt<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> mean<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
it salt but you can see I mean this is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.299 
it salt but you can see I mean this is
ten<00:00:59.460> years<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:01.109> add<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.620> leaks<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
ten years and it's add some leaks and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.050 
ten years and it's add some leaks and
it's<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.510> nasty<00:01:04.189> but<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> celtics

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it's just nasty but that's the celtics

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
it's just nasty but that's the celtics
on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> bottom<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:08.820> spots<00:01:09.860> where

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
on the bottom and that's all spots where

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
on the bottom and that's all spots where
mice<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:12.150> gotten<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.900> room<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.260> made

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
mice have gotten into this room and made

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.929 
mice have gotten into this room and made
nests<00:01:14.119> back<00:01:15.119> behind<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:16.340> mean<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
nests back behind I mean this thing is a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.990 
nests back behind I mean this thing is a
disaster<00:01:18.060> zone<00:01:19.009> but<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.340> 10<00:01:20.520> years<00:01:20.759> I'm

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
disaster zone but for 10 years I'm

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.420 
disaster zone but for 10 years I'm
really<00:01:21.750> surprised<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.860> doesn't<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
really surprised actually it doesn't I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
really surprised actually it doesn't I
thought<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> would<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:24.450> worth<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:26.130> here

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
thought it would be a lot worth but here

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.090 
thought it would be a lot worth but here
at<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> bottom<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> liner

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.080 

so<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> next<00:01:31.270> step<00:01:31.600> is<00:01:31.900> rip<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.560> thing<00:01:32.619> out

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
so the next step is rip this thing out

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520 
so the next step is rip this thing out
we're<00:01:34.090> going<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.270> repaint<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.380> get

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
we're going to repaint and get

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.260 
we're going to repaint and get
everything<00:01:35.740> dressed<00:01:36.189> up<00:01:36.430> real<00:01:36.670> nice<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.150> then

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
everything dressed up real nice and then

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.539 
everything dressed up real nice and then
we'll<00:01:37.420> start<00:01:37.630> working<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.259> pond<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.799> new

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
we'll start working on the pond a new

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.640 
we'll start working on the pond a new
pond<00:01:39.790> new<00:01:40.450> ponds<00:01:40.720> go<00:01:40.930> be<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.080> little<00:01:41.320> deeper

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
pond new ponds go be a little deeper

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.370 
pond new ponds go be a little deeper
same<00:01:41.979> with<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:43.240> way<00:01:43.509> it'll<00:01:43.750> be<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.960> same<00:01:44.170> I'm

that snow shovel and then come across
give<00:01:51.009> them<00:01:51.100> some<00:01:51.250> more<00:01:51.369> square<00:01:51.700> footage<00:01:52.470> did

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
give them some more square footage did

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.070 
give them some more square footage did
you<00:01:53.590> did<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:53.920> make<00:01:54.159> your<00:01:54.630> field<00:01:55.630> run<00:01:55.899> I<00:01:58.080> don't
