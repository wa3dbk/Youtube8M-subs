00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
first and but you know overleveled is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.770 
first and but you know overleveled is
better<00:02:55.200> leveled<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.240> love<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.390> make<00:02:57.510> sense

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
better leveled I love that make sense

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
go I knew he was gonna heal so I go for

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.979 
go I knew he was gonna heal so I go for
facade<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.580> get<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> bit<00:03:17.970> more<00:03:18.269> damage<00:03:18.570> on<00:03:18.840> him

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
facade to get a bit more damage on him

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.470 
facade to get a bit more damage on him
before<00:03:19.920> actually<00:03:20.280> going<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.760> using<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.120> vital

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
before actually going and using on vital

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.860 
before actually going and using on vital
front<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.890> they<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> bit<00:03:23.610> damaged<00:03:23.940> and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
front so they got a bit damaged and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
front so they got a bit damaged and
maybe<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.500> couple<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.830> seismic<00:03:26.190> tosses<00:03:26.670> will

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
maybe a couple of seismic tosses will

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.180 
maybe a couple of seismic tosses will
actually<00:03:27.030> take<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.300> out<00:03:27.420> but<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.660> don't<00:03:27.900> know

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
actually take it out but I don't know

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.180 
actually take it out but I don't know
tear<00:03:29.190> seismic<00:03:29.640> toss<00:03:30.050> so<00:03:31.050> takedown<00:03:31.500> can<00:03:31.860> do<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
tear seismic toss so takedown can do a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.490 
tear seismic toss so takedown can do a
bit<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.489> damage<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.780> probably<00:03:34.380> not

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
bit of damage but it's probably not

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.130 
bit of damage but it's probably not
something<00:03:34.739> you'll<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> worry<00:03:35.700> about

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
something you'll have to worry about

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
something you'll have to worry about
seeing<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:38.130> said<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.610> only<00:03:38.850> AM<00:03:40.160> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
seeing is like I said it's only AM it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.900 
seeing is like I said it's only AM it
actually<00:03:41.760> does<00:03:41.880> hit<00:03:42.090> them<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.660> recoil<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.290> well

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
actually does hit them in recoil as well

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.250 
actually does hit them in recoil as well
not<00:03:44.910> sure<00:03:45.060> how<00:03:45.209> you'd<00:03:45.390> hit<00:03:45.600> yourself<00:03:45.780> by

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
so fire types you have are gonna do a

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.920 
so fire types you have are gonna do a
hell<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:21.979> lot<00:04:22.099> of<00:04:22.129> damage<00:04:22.310> sorry<00:04:22.729> about<00:04:22.849> that
