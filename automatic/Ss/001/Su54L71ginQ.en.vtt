00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.980
 fifa in the days so certain point the Easter and the Christmas is to wait every year by the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.539
 launch of a new fifa by electronic arts franchise 15 years 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 does not show signs of fatigue and seems to finally take full advantage of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.690
 of the current generation of consolidate 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.029
 after some disappointing technical problems 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 found in previous games 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.330
 in a troubled transition period 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.110
 whether it is true or not that about 250 modifications were made in relation to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.140
 to what was 8 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.130
 it's kind of impossible to confirm 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 but it is sensitive to the difference between the versions the new game looks much more 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.630
 modern well finished and complex 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
 distancing himself not only from his older brothers 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.220
 but also from competition 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.480
 in the popular case pro evolution soccer series of konami 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.890
 which technically stopped in time 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 the graphics are more defined the movement of the players is more 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.910
 and realistic modeling of the elements that make up the games is much more 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.909
 rich 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 other examples arise when athletes raise their hands 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.030
 to warn you that they are free 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 when you feel that each one possesses the mass with the differentiated coral 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.710
 which influences its acceleration of shock with other opponents and when 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.480
 I realized that goalkeepers can sit 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.740
 on certain plays when noticing the crime 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.100
 morishita action increasing the difficulty of scoring a goal 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.260
 In a sense, the fifa series is still a more mechanical and 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.119
 cerebral 'and so not so intuitive with deep tati a soc 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.520
 which should keep the rivalry on the rise for longer 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.509
 but then aware of it 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.969
 continues to invest in an artificial intelligence system that adapts 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.660
 the player's skills 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.210
 which ends up reversing the match and do not let things get too easy or 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.329
 difficult 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.010
 if mechanics is still able to share the opinions of fans of games 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.899
 soccer 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:17.519
 at least you can not deny that fifa 9 brings content to spare to last the year 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.579
 between various mandatory modes in this type of game. 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.910
 great highlight for matches the fly 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.820
 is the manager molds that puts the player in the management of a club by several 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.730
 goalkeeper in matches of 10 against 10 things get well confused principle 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.720

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.430

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:58.219

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.130
 Ironically 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.679
 the promoter stressed 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.919
 with so many minutiae options and novelties at times it may seem 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.199
 bureaucratic or too complex for those who clung to simplicity 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.380
