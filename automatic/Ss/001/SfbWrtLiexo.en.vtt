00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.830
 my family and my special friends then 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.570
 to be drafted by the Canadian to buy 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.300
 a little more I think it's 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:23.070
 why people were happy 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 we always have because I have a locker 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 but when you know a fan of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.870
 senators and the judgment convert those 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:40.950
 who fall I watched play that comes 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.300
 to change majtan ali ben helli I am 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.960
 an attacker who can play the ale then 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 In the center 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.079
 I see that we see repeats patrice 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.250
 shepherd smelling an apple attack 28.2 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.590
 on both sides of the rink is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.969
 capable of character then go the most 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.680
 a power winger who do 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.750
 blow who apply layouts 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 failure which i have a style of play that I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.390
 can pips to my strength I had 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 meetings but also with others 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.090
 tickets we never know in his 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.470
 common repechage that can turn 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 then I am very happy that it is 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 canada the game I play I realize to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 lose but I think she was 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.299
 perceived as a hope spread like a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.770
 bigger but I do not know if in the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.979
 people's perceptions come 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.490
 tumble is not it so 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.710
 Tai Chi that are taken into account 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 I spent several things I had a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.189
 early anti season with an injury and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.140
 ch'timi then I change them more 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.479
 there it starts well and I think 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.130
 that I do not know how to explain 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.979
 on but I so much the task is what I 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.149
 suggest you demonstrate in the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.579
 series doing it well was not 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.750
 to the offensive authors but side of the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.280
 character that I can bring putting into 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 failure both team leaders and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.819
 everything is encompassed in this tale at pau 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.739
 maybe in the light of all that 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.149
 I had done in the series udder 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.130
 for those I'm happy with because 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.630
 I arrive in a role of neglected if we 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.239
 can say to try to make my way 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.340
 then go up to the game but you play bay 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.230
 comeau would like it but a white one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.060
 attitude is blank follows everywhere when 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.500
 I started at one point and then I 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.500
 notice that ice cream then skate 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.680
 until when 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.890
 as soon as
