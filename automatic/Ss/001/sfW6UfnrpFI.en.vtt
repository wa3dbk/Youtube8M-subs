right so then and she would look for EPA
and<00:01:55.710> DHA

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and DHA

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.240 
and DHA
on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.180> back<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.140> supplemental<00:01:58.979> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
on the back but this supplemental in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330 
on the back but this supplemental in
doesn't<00:01:59.700> differentiate<00:02:00.090> between<00:02:01.130> how<00:02:02.130> many

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
doesn't differentiate between how many

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
doesn't differentiate between how many
the<00:02:02.640> total<00:02:02.969> milligrams<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.479> fish<00:02:03.600> oil<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> how

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the total milligrams of fish oil and how

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.330 
the total milligrams of fish oil and how
you're<00:02:04.480> actually<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.960> EPA<00:02:05.200> DHA<00:02:05.470> this<00:02:06.130> would

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
you're actually the EPA DHA this would

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.190 
you're actually the EPA DHA this would
probably<00:02:06.520> not<00:02:06.910> be<00:02:07.180> your<00:02:07.450> best<00:02:07.510> choice<00:02:07.900> yeah<00:02:08.020> I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
probably not be your best choice yeah I

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.719 
probably not be your best choice yeah I
would<00:02:08.649> probably<00:02:09.039> put<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.250> one<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.700> you

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
would probably put that one that you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.220 
would probably put that one that you
have<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.910> buying<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.300> myself<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.810> put<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.110> one

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
have a buying it myself I put that one

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.390 
have a buying it myself I put that one
back<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.560> show<00:02:11.710> because<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.040> want<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.250> know

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
back in the show because I want to know

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.050 
back in the show because I want to know
specifically<00:02:13.030> how<00:02:13.750> much<00:02:14.370> those<00:02:15.370> omega-3s<00:02:15.910> are

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
specifically how much those omega-3s are

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.210 
specifically how much those omega-3s are
DHA<00:02:16.650> EPA<00:02:17.650> okay<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:18.490> she<00:02:18.640> kept<00:02:18.850> browsing<00:02:19.600> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
DHA EPA okay but she kept browsing and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.220 
DHA EPA okay but she kept browsing and
here<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.400> another<00:02:21.550> one<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.330> serving<00:02:23.080> size

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
here is another one this serving size

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.250 
here is another one this serving size
for<00:02:23.260> two<00:02:23.560> soft<00:02:23.890> gels<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.400> scroll<00:02:25.060> down<00:02:25.090> see<00:02:25.660> EPA

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
for two soft gels I scroll down see EPA

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.240 
for two soft gels I scroll down see EPA
and<00:02:26.500> DHA<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.940> an<00:02:28.170> 1,200<00:02:29.170> milligrams<00:02:29.290> so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
and DHA that is an 1,200 milligrams so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.090 
and DHA that is an 1,200 milligrams so
this<00:02:31.150> seems<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> great<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.140> yeah<00:02:32.920> they're

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
this seems like a great one yeah they're

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.460 
this seems like a great one yeah they're
cute<00:02:33.250> soft<00:02:33.550> oh<00:02:33.670> yeah<00:02:33.910> BM<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:35.050> Cooper

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
cute soft oh yeah BM that Cooper

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.620 
cute soft oh yeah BM that Cooper
complete<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.070> excellent<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:36.970> -<00:02:37.330> soft

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
complete is an excellent one so - soft

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.320 
complete is an excellent one so - soft
gels<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.680> over<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> thousand<00:02:39.700> versus<00:02:40.090> four

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
gels to get over a thousand versus four

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.630 
gels to get over a thousand versus four
right<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.620> other<00:02:41.740> one<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.070> not<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.550> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
right the other one it's not that it's a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.250 
right the other one it's not that it's a
bad<00:02:42.670> product<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.480> just<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.020> need<00:02:44.170> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
bad product it's just that you need to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.410 
bad product it's just that you need to
take<00:02:44.380> twice<00:02:45.040> as<00:02:45.070> much<00:02:45.310> together<00:02:45.520> okay<00:02:46.180> so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
take twice as much together okay so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.810 
take twice as much together okay so
sometimes<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.080> worth<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.489> look<00:02:48.670> for

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
sometimes it's worth it to to look for

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.610 
sometimes it's worth it to to look for
those<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.180> are<00:02:49.300> more<00:02:49.330> concentrated<00:02:50.230> okay

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
those that are more concentrated okay

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.199 
those that are more concentrated okay
yeah<00:02:50.980> I've<00:02:51.130> been<00:02:51.160> specifically<00:02:51.730> looking<00:02:52.120> at

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
yeah I've been specifically looking at

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.310 
yeah I've been specifically looking at
the<00:02:52.360> EPA<00:02:52.630> DHA<00:02:54.239> if<00:02:55.239> she<00:02:55.510> wanted<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:55.989> more

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
the EPA DHA if she wanted to get more

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the EPA DHA if she wanted to get more
omega-3s<00:02:56.830> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
omega-3s and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.790 
omega-3s and
not<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.330> from<00:02:58.480> fish<00:02:58.600> oil<00:02:58.720> alone<00:02:59.050> or<00:02:59.410> finished

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
not just from fish oil alone or finished

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.680 
not just from fish oil alone or finished
how<00:03:00.100> could<00:03:00.670> she<00:03:00.700> be<00:03:00.790> able<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.120> there<00:03:01.300> well

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
how could she be able to get there well

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.170 
how could she be able to get there well
we<00:03:01.840> can<00:03:01.989> get<00:03:02.170> Omega<00:03:02.830> threes<00:03:03.130> also<00:03:03.730> from<00:03:03.910> plant

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
we can get Omega threes also from plant

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.240 
we can get Omega threes also from plant
sources<00:03:04.270> okay<00:03:04.780> no<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.320> fish<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.860> mean<00:03:06.010> if<00:03:06.070> she's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
sources okay no the fish I mean if she's

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
sources okay no the fish I mean if she's
eating<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.489> lot<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.820> fish<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.870> she<00:03:08.020> would

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
eating a lot of fish that she would

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.840 
eating a lot of fish that she would
probably<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.709> know<00:03:08.799> cut<00:03:09.280> back<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.489> little<00:03:09.610> bit

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
probably you know cut back a little bit

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.300 
probably you know cut back a little bit
on<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> couple<00:03:10.660> months<00:03:10.890> especially<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.160> fatty

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
on a couple months especially the fatty

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.120 
on a couple months especially the fatty
fish<00:03:12.549> like<00:03:12.580> salmon<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.269> my<00:03:13.450> favorite<00:03:13.840> sources

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
fish like salmon and my favorite sources

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.370 
fish like salmon and my favorite sources
now<00:03:15.130> our<00:03:15.280> plant<00:03:15.580> sources<00:03:15.940> such<00:03:16.690> as<00:03:16.720> on

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
now our plant sources such as on

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.750 
now our plant sources such as on
flaxseed<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.040> normal<00:03:18.959> but<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.190> Omega<00:03:21.489> threes

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
flaxseed and normal but the Omega threes

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.670 
flaxseed and normal but the Omega threes
however<00:03:22.540> there<00:03:23.049> are<00:03:23.140> different<00:03:23.440> amenities

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
however there are different amenities

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.270 
however there are different amenities
okay<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:25.060> fish<00:03:25.299> omega<00:03:26.049> threes<00:03:26.350> are<00:03:26.620> EPA<00:03:26.950> DHA

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
okay the fish omega threes are EPA DHA

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.610 
okay the fish omega threes are EPA DHA
and<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:29.019> plant<00:03:30.060> omega-3s<00:03:31.060> are<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.510> la<00:03:31.900> event

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
and the plant omega-3s are a la event

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.850 
and the plant omega-3s are a la event
different<00:03:33.070> acronym<00:03:33.670> so<00:03:34.330> they're<00:03:35.019> not<00:03:35.620> they're

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
different acronym so they're not they're

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.550 
different acronym so they're not they're
bad<00:03:35.980> because<00:03:36.190> they're<00:03:36.730> good<00:03:36.910> however<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
bad because they're good however to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.810 
bad because they're good however to
convert<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.250> EPA<00:03:40.030> DHA<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.530> process<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.610> not

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
convert to EPA DHA the process is not

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.370 
convert to EPA DHA the process is not
very<00:03:43.000> efficient<00:03:43.420> at<00:03:43.480> all<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:44.049> they<00:03:44.230> know<00:03:44.350> very

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
very efficient at all so they know very

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.990 
very efficient at all so they know very
little<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.250> EPA<00:03:45.549> DHA

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
little on the EPA DHA

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.539 
little on the EPA DHA
that's<00:03:46.330> good<00:03:46.540> for<00:03:46.780> us<00:03:46.989> but<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.590> not<00:03:48.010> as<00:03:48.280> good

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
that's good for us but just not as good

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.300 
that's good for us but just not as good
as<00:03:48.820> directly<00:03:49.780> from<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.110> EPA<00:03:50.440> DHA<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.100> ha
