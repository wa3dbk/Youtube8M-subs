00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
never say that right but anyhow it's got

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090 
never say that right but anyhow it's got
that<00:00:33.540> plate<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.170> that's<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that plate so that's kind of one of the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
that plate so that's kind of one of the
things<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> style<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.090> most<00:00:36.330> notable

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
things that this style is most notable

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.870 
things that this style is most notable
for<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> date<00:00:38.370> code<00:00:38.580> on<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.060> is<00:00:40.880> four

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
for and the date code on this is four

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.050 
for and the date code on this is four
zero<00:00:42.210> five<00:00:42.660> eight<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.380> 45th<00:00:43.860> week<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.280> 2008

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
zero five eight so the 45th week of 2008

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.450 
zero five eight so the 45th week of 2008
so<00:00:45.240> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> fairly<00:00:46.350> aged<00:00:46.920> bag

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so this is actually a fairly aged bag

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
so this is actually a fairly aged bag
it's<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.060> four<00:00:48.390> years<00:00:48.540> old<00:00:48.900> three<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it's about four years old three and a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's about four years old three and a
half<00:00:49.980> years<00:00:50.220> old<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.800> I'd<00:00:52.800> say<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.220> probably

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
half years old and I'd say it's probably

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.370 
half years old and I'd say it's probably
held<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.940> pretty<00:00:54.060> well<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.840> probably

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
held up pretty well I'm about probably

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.650 
held up pretty well I'm about probably
the<00:00:55.500> third<00:00:56.070> owner<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.790> this<00:00:57.030> which

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the third owner of this which

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.360 
the third owner of this which
unfortunately<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.290> think<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.740> testament<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
unfortunately I think is a testament to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.720 
unfortunately I think is a testament to
the<00:01:00.180> Eva<00:01:00.450> style<00:01:01.070> possibly<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.220> working<00:01:02.610> out

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the Eva style possibly not working out

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
the Eva style possibly not working out
for<00:01:02.970> everyone<00:01:03.360> it's<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.290> getting

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
for everyone it's really not getting

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
for everyone it's really not getting
very<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:04.920> used<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.189> my<00:01:05.339> house<00:01:05.519> either<00:01:05.759> but

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
very much used in my house either but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
very much used in my house either but
I'd<00:01:06.540> say<00:01:06.810> four<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> know<00:01:07.890> having<00:01:08.100> changed

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
I'd say four and you know having changed

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450 
I'd say four and you know having changed
hands<00:01:08.969> a<00:01:09.149> few<00:01:09.299> different<00:01:09.630> times<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.460> what

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
hands a few different times and what

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
hands a few different times and what
looks<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.759> probably<00:01:12.149> sporadic<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.869> by

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
looks like probably sporadic use by

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
looks like probably sporadic use by
everyone<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.710> owned<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.450> know

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
everyone that's owned it it's you know

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.940 
everyone that's owned it it's you know
it's<00:01:15.719> held<00:01:15.899> up<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.049> well<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.649> zipper<00:01:16.859> on

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it's held up really well the zipper on

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.969 
it's held up really well the zipper on
these<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.579> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.810> accessory<00:01:19.469> type<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
these is a little accessory type of

zipper<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.579> I<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.929> like<00:01:22.170> these

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
zipper and I actually really like these

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
zippers because they zip really nicely

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
zippers because they zip really nicely
really<00:01:24.479> smoothly<00:01:24.929> and<00:01:25.649> they're<00:01:25.859> also<00:01:26.009> very

which is kind of nice if you go out to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
which is kind of nice if you go out to
dinners<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.889> that<00:01:50.009> sort<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.369> thing<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.149> do

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
dinners and that sort of thing so I do

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.779 
dinners and that sort of thing so I do
like<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.600> feature<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.709> I<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
like that feature and I like that it

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.789 
like that feature and I like that it
seems<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.329> held<00:01:54.539> up<00:01:54.659> pretty<00:01:54.869> well<00:01:55.020> even

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
seems like it's held up pretty well even

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
seems like it's held up pretty well even
though<00:01:55.859> it's<00:01:56.009> always<00:01:56.340> attached<00:01:56.639> to<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> bag

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
though it's always attached to the bag

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.449 
though it's always attached to the bag
there's<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:57.719> way<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.959> get<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.319> off<00:01:58.499> unless

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
there's no way to get this off unless

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.459 
there's no way to get this off unless
you<00:01:59.609> alter<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.119> bag<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.959> if<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.170> wearing<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
you alter the bag so if you're wearing a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.289 
you alter the bag so if you're wearing a
crossbody<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.039> chain<00:02:02.490> does<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> stay<00:02:03.270> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
crossbody the chain does have to stay on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
crossbody the chain does have to stay on
there<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> feel<00:02:04.289> like<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.560> held<00:02:04.799> up

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
there but I feel like it's held up

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.700 
there but I feel like it's held up
pretty<00:02:05.159> well<00:02:05.340> even<00:02:05.880> though<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.329> always

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
pretty well even though it's always

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.969 
pretty well even though it's always
on<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.010> bag<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:08.660> plate<00:02:09.110> honestly<00:02:09.800> probably

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
on the bag the plate honestly probably

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.010 
on the bag the plate honestly probably
shows<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.550> most<00:02:10.729> wear<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.300> style<00:02:11.600> because

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
shows the most wear on the style because

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.290 
shows the most wear on the style because
it's<00:02:12.200> got<00:02:12.350> scratches<00:02:12.680> all<00:02:13.010> over<00:02:13.040> it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
it's got scratches all over it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.210 
it's got scratches all over it
you<00:02:14.660> know<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.810> mean<00:02:15.170> I'll<00:02:15.620> try<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.950> show<00:02:16.190> a

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
you know I mean I'll try to show a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.949 
you know I mean I'll try to show a
little<00:02:16.310> detail<00:02:16.880> show<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.150> up<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> front<00:02:17.750> up

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
little detail show it up to the front up

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.170 
little detail show it up to the front up
to<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> side<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.730> there's<00:02:19.910> little

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
to the side but you know there's little

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.580 
to the side but you know there's little
scratches<00:02:20.600> down<00:02:20.720> here<00:02:20.900> at<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.050> bottom<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.530> I

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
scratches down here at the bottom and I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.750 
scratches down here at the bottom and I
think<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.160> kind<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.459> inevitable

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
think that it's just kind of inevitable

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.660 
think that it's just kind of inevitable
with<00:02:23.450> wear<00:02:23.780> especially<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.160> Eva<00:02:25.340> as

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
with wear especially on the Eva as

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.910 
with wear especially on the Eva as
opposed<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.300> goal<00:02:26.450> area<00:02:26.630> hobo<00:02:27.620> style

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
opposed to the goal area hobo style

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920 
opposed to the goal area hobo style
because<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.330> plates<00:02:29.569> gonna<00:02:29.720> be

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
because that like the plates gonna be

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.720 
because that like the plates gonna be
more<00:02:30.110> underneath<00:02:30.500> your<00:02:30.650> arm<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.700> can

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
more underneath your arm and you can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.160 
more underneath your arm and you can
protect<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.360> little<00:02:32.569> bit<00:02:32.660> more<00:02:32.870> but<00:02:33.080> if

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
protect it a little bit more but if

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.990 
protect it a little bit more but if
you're<00:02:33.319> wearing<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.830> crossbody<00:02:34.430> or<00:02:34.580> even

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
you're wearing this crossbody or even

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.820 
you're wearing this crossbody or even
using<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.300> as<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.540> clutch<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.470> I'm<00:02:36.590> kind<00:02:36.800> of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
using it as a clutch and I'm kind of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.290 
using it as a clutch and I'm kind of
holding<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.220> your<00:02:37.340> hand<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.819> swinging<00:02:38.209> it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
holding in your hand and swinging it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300 
holding in your hand and swinging it
around<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.780> think<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> plate<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.070> this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
around I think that the plate on this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.580 
around I think that the plate on this
Eva<00:02:40.610> style<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.019> lot<00:02:42.320> more

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
Eva style is going to get a lot more

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.680 
Eva style is going to get a lot more
wear<00:02:42.920> than<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.700> would<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:43.910> like<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.300> shoulder

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
wear than it would on like a shoulder

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.840 
wear than it would on like a shoulder
bag<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.709> think<00:02:45.890> that's<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.310> kind<00:02:46.519> of<00:02:46.580> one<00:02:46.730> of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
bag so I think that's is kind of one of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.920 
bag so I think that's is kind of one of
the<00:02:47.000> unfortunate<00:02:47.870> things<00:02:48.140> about<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:49.100> style

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the unfortunate things about this style

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.070 
the unfortunate things about this style

the interior on the dhaniya bean is this

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.140 
the interior on the dhaniya bean is this
red<00:02:54.380> kind<00:02:54.739> of<00:02:54.830> canvas<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.550> easy<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.970> clean

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
bit since it's the canvas and then I

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.350 
bit since it's the canvas and then I
really<00:03:12.650> like<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:13.010> detachable<00:03:13.519> strap<00:03:13.730> on<00:03:14.120> this

it's<00:03:21.019> very<00:03:21.260> all-weather<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.769> really<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.340> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
it's very all-weather I really like that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.580 
it's very all-weather I really like that
these<00:03:23.299> clips<00:03:23.720> seem<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.200> be<00:03:24.320> pretty

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
these clips seem to be pretty

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.199 
these clips seem to be pretty
substantial<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.579> haven't<00:03:25.910> had<00:03:26.030> any

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
substantial and I haven't had any

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.479 
substantial and I haven't had any
problems<00:03:26.600> with<00:03:26.630> these<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.370> obviously<00:03:28.370> they

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
problems with these and obviously they

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.100 
problems with these and obviously they
have<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.700> little<00:03:29.060> turning<00:03:29.420> aspect<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:29.959> them

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
have the little turning aspect on them

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.370 
have the little turning aspect on them
and<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.320> works<00:03:30.560> great<00:03:30.920> as<00:03:31.070> well<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:33.230> can

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
and that works great as well so you can

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.289 
and that works great as well so you can
clip<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.680> on<00:03:33.799> both<00:03:34.010> sides<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.700> then<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.120> is

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
clip it on both sides and then that is

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.449 
clip it on both sides and then that is
what<00:03:35.510> makes<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.959> into<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.350> longer<00:03:36.920> crossbody

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
what makes it into the longer crossbody

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.759 
what makes it into the longer crossbody
bag<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.360> really<00:03:38.660> no<00:03:38.780> issues<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.440> strap

the<00:03:40.010> strap<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.459> held<00:03:40.640> up<00:03:40.760> great<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.360> doesn't

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the strap is held up great it doesn't

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.880 
the strap is held up great it doesn't
really<00:03:41.690> show<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.110> much<00:03:42.170> where<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.829> do

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
necessarily works for me but just as far

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
as wear and tear goes I felt like the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.539 
as wear and tear goes I felt like the
bag<00:04:02.989> has<00:04:03.170> really<00:04:03.440> hold<00:04:03.650> up<00:04:03.769> very<00:04:03.950> well

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.940 
bag has really hold up very well
especially<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.570> this<00:04:05.660> dummy<00:04:05.930> being<00:04:06.500> print

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
especially in this dummy being print

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.340 
especially in this dummy being print
it's<00:04:07.250> very<00:04:07.790> durable<00:04:08.060> it's<00:04:08.450> very<00:04:08.720> all<00:04:08.900> seasoned

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.380 
it's very durable it's very all seasoned
and<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.980> think<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.459> is<00:04:10.640> a<00:04:10.670> great<00:04:10.940> option

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
and I think that this is a great option

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.840 
and I think that this is a great option
if<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:11.810> need<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.200> small<00:04:12.590> bag<00:04:12.859> like<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.250> that

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
if you need a small bag like this that

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.920 
if you need a small bag like this that
can<00:04:14.000> go<00:04:14.180> into<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.480> lot<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.720> different

can go into a lot of different
situations<00:04:15.680> maybe

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
situations maybe

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.490 
situations maybe
be<00:04:16.310> dressed<00:04:16.579> up<00:04:16.760> maybe<00:04:17.000> be<00:04:17.239> dressed<00:04:17.540> down<00:04:17.630> this

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
be dressed up maybe be dressed down this

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.620 
be dressed up maybe be dressed down this
is<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.680> really<00:04:19.010> versatile<00:04:19.489> bag<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:20.120> holds<00:04:20.510> up

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
is a really versatile bag that holds up

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.200 
is a really versatile bag that holds up
really<00:04:21.049> well<00:04:21.230> so<00:04:21.730> there<00:04:22.730> really<00:04:22.940> isn't

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
really well so there really isn't

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.050 
really well so there really isn't
anything<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:24.260> major<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.340> note<00:04:25.520> other<00:04:25.760> than

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
anything of major to note other than

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.030 
anything of major to note other than
this<00:04:26.240> front<00:04:26.540> plate<00:04:26.780> being<00:04:27.350> susceptible<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
this front plate being susceptible to

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.020 
this front plate being susceptible to
getting<00:04:28.430> scratched

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
getting scratched

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.370 
getting scratched
I<00:04:29.120> believe<00:04:29.420> especially<00:04:30.080> with<00:04:30.200> this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
I believe especially with this

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.530 
I believe especially with this
particular<00:04:30.710> style<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.970> know<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.150> corners

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
particular style you know the corners

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.380 
particular style you know the corners
have<00:04:32.690> all<00:04:32.840> held<00:04:33.050> up<00:04:33.170> really<00:04:33.290> well<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:34.390> just

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
have all held up really well and just

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.940 
have all held up really well and just
overall<00:04:35.690> on<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.050> body<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.470> bag<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.890> really

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
overall on the body of a bag it really

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.900 
overall on the body of a bag it really
looks<00:04:37.430> great<00:04:37.640> so<00:04:38.240> there<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.170> a<00:04:39.430> little<00:04:40.430> clutch

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
looks great so there is a little clutch

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.430 
looks great so there is a little clutch
I<00:04:40.940> believe<00:04:41.270> it's<00:04:41.420> I'm<00:04:41.750> gonna<00:04:41.930> botch<00:04:42.140> these

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
I believe it's I'm gonna botch these

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.110 
I believe it's I'm gonna botch these
names<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:42.890> I<00:04:42.950> apologize<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:43.670> it's<00:04:43.850> like<00:04:43.970> the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
names so I apologize but it's like the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.180 
names so I apologize but it's like the
millah<00:04:44.690> clutch<00:04:45.110> or<00:04:45.440> Amelia

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
millah clutch or Amelia

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.610 
millah clutch or Amelia
I<00:04:46.220> think<00:04:46.550> it's<00:04:46.670> Milla<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.990> does<00:04:48.200> not<00:04:48.350> have

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
I think it's Milla and it does not have

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.620 
I think it's Milla and it does not have
this<00:04:48.830> plate<00:04:49.100> so<00:04:49.130> just<00:04:49.700> imagine<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.270> believe<00:04:50.540> it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
this plate so just imagine I believe it

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.110 
this plate so just imagine I believe it
sound<00:04:50.780> like<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.990> monogram<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.070> usher<00:04:52.460> so

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
sound like the monogram and the usher so

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.730 
sound like the monogram and the usher so
just<00:04:53.270> imagine<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:53.840> had<00:04:53.990> something<00:04:54.590> of

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
just imagine if you had something of

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.380 
just imagine if you had something of
round<00:04:55.130> about<00:04:55.460> this<00:04:55.700> size<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.360> shape

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
round about this size and the shape

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
just wish it was maybe a little bit

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.380 
just wish it was maybe a little bit
taller<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:13.220> it<00:05:13.310> accommodated<00:05:13.820> my<00:05:14.060> things

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390

taller so that it accommodated my things
a<00:05:14.630> little<00:05:14.750> bit<00:05:14.960> better<00:05:15.140> but<00:05:15.770> other<00:05:16.010> than<00:05:16.220> that
