00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.110
 then we simulate a hunt 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.270
 situation is still very green now 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.060
 here in summer but you can do it there 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.810
 nevertheless represent very well 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.090
 it is so chronologically that I am 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.740
 Of course many times on the way already a lot 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.780
 So I can see from the trunk 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.140
 For example, often see where which change 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.210
 go 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.420
 I can see where I am already there 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.250
 shot field or not 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.449
 of course i have safety aspect 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.370
 There's always I have to 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.170
 check if the ladder somehow 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.670
 works or is broken I fractured 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.990
 must be the ground that emerged through the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.610
 check whether I certainly stand 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.950
 can or is somehow funny or 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.220
 whether I am running loud or disturbing 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.570
 example , must make or snow of 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.430
 the seat of something like that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.869
 and then I can take care of that 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.940
 What I really do later really 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.300
 namely wants to do on the success 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.180
 have the first which I stood on the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.530
 always watch where is actually shot 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.060
 or security locks 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.740
 are often that is so that you neighbor 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.240
 has or has been drawn to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.920
 enriched by not being allowed to shoot 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.590
 for example, I watch so the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 but often for the immediate 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.340
 nahbereich still my bags will be saw 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.050
 in it that so here I would 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.880
 For example, complain completely 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.630
 Here you can easily from the seat 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.979
 cut away for something further in 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.050
 things depending on the state that's just always 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.520
 very individual where I stand I have 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.039
 an open hochwald I only 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.670
 shot or whatever 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.660
 Rangefinder is always recommended 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.950
 if you do not know where you are before 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.619
 always gets a little bit more space 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.700
 you always have certain points 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.350
 can read out 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.759
 that is important for example for 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.970
 the hold measure and of course 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.740
 a hunt that is always good 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.360
 Frank I have on the bridge 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.130
 relatively rare but only if 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.290
 I know that there are big areas to 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.210
 for example, on a training ground with 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.720
 large open space shooting ranges 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.760
 or something 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.680
 because I most the otherwise over fifa only 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.330
 that's relatively rare to address 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.280
 I'm in a hunt the precise amount 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.720
 but have to look there are places where 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.620
 I need it when I shoot 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.910
 sectors and all that has measured 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.650
 and the change would come as far as I am concerned 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.750
 In any case , I can recognize myself 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.760
 always so prepared from the sitting 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.269
 or later I'll be like that too 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.129
 would really align so I stand 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.629
 or everything is so close and so 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.620
 I have absolutely no time 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.030
 perhaps 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.730
 I still stand up, too 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.319
 the whole time are on what one 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.790
 Magnification I lost my goal 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.610
 or do I make a reflex sighting 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.349
 for example when I have it and 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.569
 otherwise it is actually relative 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:15.890
 quickly set up that way then I 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:17.319
 really can get started and load 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.940
 and be ready 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.290
 he is residue for the simulation 1 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.090
 actually quite suitable here but 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.110
 two pretty different shot 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.319
 situation if you have one 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.000
 side a longer fall in that trap 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.099
 schneise there we go now in the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.129
 simulation assumes that he is safe too 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.840
 who this is now just distancing 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.489
 for that I would be the big one 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.299
 let it glass on it now that I'm on it 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.120
 I would just target readers 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.040
 and then I would like to try it 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.500
 I would shoot there later 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.329
 probably more like me that me 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.560
 actually sit down or either 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.019
 depending on the state that is just very 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.390
 individually even kneel would 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.139
 then just a perfect pad for the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.459
 to get distance 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.319
 on the short side here we would have 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.489
 now a relatively close shot tailor 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.889
 Recording distance 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.660
 there you can go to gusto if 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.260
 for example the glass simply 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.419
 decreases 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.829
 a small pusher opens or 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.400
 For example, a reflex visor I have 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.959
 now in the version here the the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.180
 made glass off because I'm a relative 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.150
 good escape so far on this 17 80 have 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.169
 Of course I have to speed up a lot here 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.520
 can go and move me what you have there 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.240
 for example, with the trade is 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.180
 actually always a bit 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.010
 trainings and and and taste 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.270
 actually I like myself do rare 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.190
 what with the grant, if any then 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.620
 hold on tight but there are of course 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.270
 different matter of taste for and there 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.289
 is recommended if I only one now 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.669
 such stand has recommended it 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.440
 actually more or less the whole 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.240
 standing time because until now I made 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.229
 from the sitting up here come that 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.669
 would take too long 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.919
 So here I would really have the whole 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.020
 be in eighth position and be in time 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.139
 then added quickly as his to 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.139
 can 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.060
 even for such short stalls as here 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.849
 short English is a hole creates 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.600
 very helpful on the long side 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.530
 He helps me because I am 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.570
 but creates a very pleasant 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.130
 I had a natural hand gesture 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.870
 Just make sure you also shoot 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.940
 relatively far away gives for the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.220
 short side it is just like me 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.320
 I'm going to stop by a fast 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.090
 Targeted hand guidance also to the deduction 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.560
 at the right distance I always have 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.750
 the same distance to come inside 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.450
 then just by quickly in a good 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.530
 Attitude to the goal 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.910
 Do not putter me at all 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.380
 There are many who say when repeating 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.120
 I would not find that hole and 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.190
 Came there so did not wake that means so 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.990
 this is not the case but you come 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.670
 on the contrary, even after the reptile 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.710
 always the same thing again and again 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.960
 in the always in the same attitude and 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.260
 can there just then with such a thing 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.760
 to go right and also when repeating 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.110
 itself I mean we now have a 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.910
 simulation situation i do not have 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.410
 loaded but it is just that one 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.660
 relatively fast and clean 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.230
 even after repeating again 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.700
 come in another advantage 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.070
 a hole made it so fast 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.380
 Stands is that you coffin the gun 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.140
 very comfortable if you can 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.360
 There is no pressure here it loosens 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.040
 a bit strange and something very different 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.020
 western but it is really one 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.880
 extremely comfortable hand attitude one can out 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.440
 said that I can do it so to speak 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.030
 hold for hours without the hand 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.580
 or something else is tired but 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.230
 still fast directly in a target 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 Extremely for me because I have not been there before 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.840
 hole I could do that exactly 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.580
 compare so for me that's one 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.810
 extreme relief for fast 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.810
 stalls and fast stops 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.140
 Yes
