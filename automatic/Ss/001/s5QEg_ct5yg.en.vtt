00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello and welcome to the topic 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.480
 cast the show around the orders cruz 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.580
 on-line 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
 since today the release of the console version 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 I would like to bring you five things with you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.039
 approximately one you necessarily know 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.039
 should before you crash into the game 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.800
 even before the release of teese came 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.690
 agree to those who claimed that 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.430
 control and be the user interface 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.440
 designed for the console 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.420
 and to be honest I too have 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.370
 that theory believed that too 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.710
 somehow obvious if a pc game 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.870
 For example, the skills at five 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.430
 is often reduced to six pieces 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.379
 this is a sign for a port of one 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.640
 console or at least a design 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.920
 decision for a later 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.899
 console version now we know that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.140
 the not so was for the consoles 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.460
 version was the old july completely 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.560
 revised he sees the on the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.600
 pc similar and you can see clearly that it 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.820
 But the same game is the adjustments 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.110
 are undeniable 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.300
 especially the size of the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.190
 individual windows and icons would be you 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.070
 on the pc quite small and space-saving 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.820
 are you great on the console 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.470
 large 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.360
 this adaptation probably depends on it 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.560
 together that you usually have a console 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.630
 a tv connects and 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.520
 accordingly far away from it so sets 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.929
 must also the elements accordingly 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.270
 be bigger so you still have them 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.690
 can recognize reasonably 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.550
 interesting is also the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.560
 Keyboard layout at first glance 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.030
 It seems a bit confusing though 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.200
 Once you get used to it 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.569
 she plays quite well 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.489
 the only criticism of me about it 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.530
 is just that interaction with 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:46.149
 items or npcs on the same 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.610
 Taste is like jumping 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.140
 both are on iks what every now and then 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.700
 leads to a jumping character 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.110
 if you actually lure a box 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.330
 But then you wanted the crate 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.800
 Suddenly not luton because she was 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.450
 example already emptied or because 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.069
 it is a non-integrable box 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.520
 and then you just jump called the 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.679
 around 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.619
 but what's the name of it? 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.619
 jump makes you lean or something like that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.659
 as a console player you have the pc 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.280
 a lot ahead in the course of the game 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.110
 Last year was at various corners 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.239
 and ends patched and improved 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.470
 Updates brought big changes like 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.390
 the right or the champion system 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.090
 but also smaller things like that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.280
 armor dyeing or new dungeons as 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.409
 pc players had a long time with bugs 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.420
 elapsed or unfinished at 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.549
 playing experience and only when the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.159
 months have passed in the country 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.840
 gradually the updates time in the 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.730
 one loyal player every month 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.040
 abo paid fees to his ex 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 all this is free for console players 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.819
 house every single update and everyone 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.530
 single patch will be in the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.099
 Console version available from startup 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.540
 his 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.940
 for the same price as that 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.650
 original game against what 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.750
 Some players claim it feels 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.370
 this now clearly more complete and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.440
 finished to the release 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.209
 just the incredible annoying ones 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.950
 bucks the first week and the input 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.079
 Delay in the fight will thiess 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.760
 console players no longer experience one 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.650
 I do not like to imagine what happens 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.329
 if you were so in this condition 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.220
 would have been read over a year ago 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.220
 maybe there would be an abo 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.510
 I just mentioned it already 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.190
 no duty but more for these since 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.930
 the conversion to both play one must 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.280
 Just buy the game one more time 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.410
 can then play unlimited 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.569
 one concludes nevertheless an abo receives 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.270
 you have a few minimal benefits 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.160
 that would be 1 10 percent bonus on each 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.050
 collected points of experience gold 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.950
 craft research and craft 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.069
 inspiration 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.440
 You will also receive 1500 kroner each month 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.970
 whom you have an abo the can you in 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.400
 Crowns shop for things like 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.950
 Costumes or healing potions later but also 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.900
 probably for dlcs and while your abo 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.769
 You have access to active things anyway 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.459
 all dlcs 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.660
 but as I said it is purely optional 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.790
 however, you have to play as a console player 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.340
 but still an active subscription at xbox 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.590
 own live or playstation plus 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.830
 If you do not have this, you can not 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.830
 play 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.510
 There was an announcement recently 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.000
 was annoyed at many fans 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.660
 here is no text on the console 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.760
 have chat 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.650
 came out to see the last one 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.270
 consoles beta first answer 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.890
 responsible of his ex still 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.970
 falsely with the note that 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.840
 it very well in the finished version 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.970
 will be 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.860
 later but then rowed back and 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.260
 officially declared that there is no 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.180
 text chat on the console will be in 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.740
 the same breath became the use of 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.460
 mouse and keyboard on the console 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.410
 prevented 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.000
 if you for some reason 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.650
 you were looking forward to it on the couch 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.030
 to sit with mouse and keyboard 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.250
 we want to deliver by one 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.630
 controller these two messages 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.150
 Of course, they are directly related 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 together with a controller is a 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.320
 text most cumbersome and none 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.760
 case practical because you mouse and 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.200
 not have the console game keyboard 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.180
 probably because of too big 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.180
 Inequality in the pvp makes it quite 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.500
 meaning to remove the text but you may 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.700
 quite the question of the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.890
 meaningfulness of this decision 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.660
 make one of the main components of a 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.430
 cars is the social one of the 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.380
 Players chat is thus one 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.270
 an essential part of the game experience him 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.280
 to remove is an important element 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.050
 to remove completely from the game 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.580
 Apart from that you can not go to 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.720
 part of very interesting talks one 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.430
 chat 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.980
 the economy is also very different 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.780
 be without chat who knows there is one 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.550
 voice chat in the game but should then the 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.010
 Dealers will advertise their goods there as well 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.640
 Barker for the sake of the best 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.640
 I can not imagine 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.919
 Although today is the official release 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.690
 the console version of teese that is 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.120
 but not that it's a reboot for everyone 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.770
 is there the console version originally 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.240
 was planned much earlier and afterwards 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.070
 repeatedly moved backwards 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.199
 has to have his mix the players 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.180
 offered first a pcb and too 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.979
 buy and later for a small one 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.320
 obolus to switch to the console 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.820
 after all I've heard it is 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.870
 not a lot of players do this 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.000
 deal have been received 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.770
 they only played their part on the pc 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.720
 characters rattled and the castles 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.160
 in theory and made sure now 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.660
 you could do yours a few weeks ago 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.430
 characters on the console version 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.889
 Copy and there from further today 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.270
 of course that has the consequence that 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.320
 these games with a clear 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.479
 start the projection 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.520
 In some cases they have been like this for over a year 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.620
 played and just this time they are 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.419
 Now it's time to retake that 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.100
 pc of course not different but the 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.650
 console version would release today 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.810
 is that a little novum then for 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.479
 release there are already max level charts 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.430
 just in open world pvp have this 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.870
 a great advantage and become a player 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.570
 thus the pvp in the first weeks 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.490
 but dominate quite honestly there is now 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.039
 really worse when the complete 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.479
 new since when is this easy you can 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.460
 even benefit from it because you are 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.840
 could contact people at the problems 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.729
 know the game from the effeff 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.650
 It is already growing 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.300
 giving guild structures simply asks 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.940
 sometimes the whole thing has a lot 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.200
 positive 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.300
 and with that, I am also at the end of this 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.979
 There are a few videos as you can see 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.840
 Things to do about the console version 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.370
 should know and even if I myself 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.990
 not gonna play on the console 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.030
 I think they are good for the game 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.950
 Could in any case I wish you 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.930
 Have fun at the consumer areal 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.440
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.440
 next time
