the<00:00:12.240> last<00:00:12.480> story<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.230> ended<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.880> basic

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the last story we ended with the basic

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.779 
the last story we ended with the basic
structure<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:17.210> website<00:00:18.770> of<00:00:19.770> HW<00:00:20.310> HTML

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
structure of I website of HW HTML

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.500 
structure of I website of HW HTML
document<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.220> HTML<00:00:23.220> tag<00:00:23.460> close<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.119> open

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
document so the HTML tag close and open

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.500 
document so the HTML tag close and open
and<00:00:25.320> close<00:00:25.529> head<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.160> body<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.359> also

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and close head and body and we also

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
and close head and body and we also
wrote<00:00:27.750> lead<00:00:27.930> pipe<00:00:28.230> paragraph<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.429> title

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
wrote lead pipe paragraph and the title

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270 
wrote lead pipe paragraph and the title
of<00:00:30.179> our<00:00:30.960> website

um

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.000 

so<00:00:36.440> there's<00:00:37.440> basic<00:00:37.829> structure<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.800> now

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so there's basic structure and it now

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.640 
so there's basic structure and it now
we're<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> go<00:00:41.909> over<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:43.879> basics<00:00:45.229> how<00:00:46.229> to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
we're going to go over the basics how to

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.300 
we're going to go over the basics how to
create<00:00:48.340> an<00:00:48.430> image<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:49.690> to

you probably know BB scripts from forums

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:16.670 
you probably know BB scripts from forums
which<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.190> basically<00:01:06.610> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.940 

for<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> link<00:01:17.700> whatever<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:20.600> HTTP

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
for a link whatever you want to be HTTP

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
for a link whatever you want to be HTTP
that's<00:01:22.950> basically<00:01:23.550> what<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.120> love<00:01:24.480> you<00:01:24.510> know

that's basically what I love you know

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.700 
that's basically what I love you know
how<00:01:25.710> does<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.120> but<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:27.150> link<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.660> HTML<00:01:28.380> sleep

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
how does that but a link in HTML sleep

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.580 
how does that but a link in HTML sleep
special<00:01:30.380> starts<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.800> four<00:01:32.130> anchor

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
special starts off with a four anchor

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.859 
special starts off with a four anchor
and<00:01:36.080> then<00:01:37.080> needs<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:38.070> few

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.899 

parameters<00:01:41.869> say<00:01:42.619> probably<00:01:42.979> which<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.640> firstly

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
parameters say probably which is firstly

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.240 
parameters say probably which is firstly
ate<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.810> hrs

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
ate the hrs

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.880 
ate the hrs
which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.720> location<00:01:49.020> where<00:01:49.230> it's<00:01:49.500> going

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
which is the location where it's going

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.880 
which is the location where it's going
so<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.600> could<00:01:51.750> either<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.200> site<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.680> your

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so it could either be your site on your

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.180 
so it could either be your site on your
website<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.640> could<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.210> index<00:01:55.190> dot

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
website which could be like index dot

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.780 
website which could be like index dot
HTML<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:57.590> course<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.890> also<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.310> I

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.940 

URL<00:02:03.790> http

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.140 

calm<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.569> that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
calm so I have that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.550 
calm so I have that
