on<00:04:12.419> our<00:04:12.660> skies<00:04:12.959> now<00:04:13.169> for<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> few<00:04:13.680> years<00:04:13.709> it's

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
on our skies now for a few years it's

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.770 
on our skies now for a few years it's
well<00:04:14.579> known<00:04:14.819> that<00:04:14.879> they<00:04:15.150> were<00:04:15.180> testing<00:04:15.660> these

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
well known that they were testing these

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.479 
well known that they were testing these
aircraft<00:04:16.289> well<00:04:16.470> before<00:04:16.829> they<00:04:17.010> notified

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
aircraft well before they notified

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849 
aircraft well before they notified
people<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:17.970> they<00:04:18.060> even<00:04:18.239> existed<00:04:18.479> now<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.650> top

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
people that they even existed now on top

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.890 
people that they even existed now on top
of<00:04:19.919> all<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.220> we<00:04:20.579> have<00:04:20.699> unmanned<00:04:21.239> drones<00:04:21.599> up

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
of all that we have unmanned drones up

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.960 
of all that we have unmanned drones up
in<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.139> sky<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.740> those<00:04:23.190> things<00:04:23.400> really<00:04:23.729> look

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
in the sky and those things really look

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.200 
in the sky and those things really look
strange<00:04:24.710> there<00:04:25.710> are<00:04:25.830> some<00:04:26.039> proof<00:04:26.340> for<00:04:26.760> all<00:04:27.000> you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
strange there are some proof for all you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.379 
strange there are some proof for all you
doubters<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.780> naysayers<00:04:28.440> out<00:04:28.770> there<00:04:29.210> he<00:04:30.210> was

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
doubters and naysayers out there he was

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.080 
doubters and naysayers out there he was
just<00:04:30.539> talking<00:04:30.750> about<00:04:31.110> unmanned<00:04:32.039> drones<00:04:32.669> in

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
just talking about unmanned drones in

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.570 
just talking about unmanned drones in
the<00:04:33.150> sky<00:04:33.599> they<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.740> unmanned<00:04:35.159> drones<00:04:35.430> are

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the sky they the unmanned drones are

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.050 
the sky they the unmanned drones are
here<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.510> they<00:04:36.659> are<00:04:36.690> real<00:04:37.199> it<00:04:37.380> looks<00:04:37.409> like

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
here and they are real it looks like

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.270 
here and they are real it looks like
UFOs<00:04:39.060> are<00:04:39.539> here<00:04:39.780> too<00:04:40.020> but<00:04:40.260> what<00:04:40.500> are<00:04:40.680> they<00:04:40.919> what

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
UFOs are here too but what are they what

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.250 
UFOs are here too but what are they what
are<00:04:41.430> these<00:04:41.550> unidentified<00:04:41.820> flying<00:04:42.599> objects

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.870 

especially<00:04:46.260> for<00:04:46.710> somebody<00:04:46.919> that<00:04:47.099> has<00:04:47.370> no<00:04:47.550> idea

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
especially for somebody that has no idea

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.570 
especially for somebody that has no idea
what<00:04:48.090> they<00:04:48.210> could<00:04:48.389> even<00:04:48.510> be

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
what they could even be

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.580 
what they could even be
and<00:04:51.300> certainly<00:04:51.840> some<00:04:52.080> people<00:04:52.379> may<00:04:52.530> be

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
and certainly some people may be

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.439 
and certainly some people may be
skeptical<00:04:53.400> when<00:04:53.550> they<00:04:53.669> hear<00:04:53.879> that<00:04:53.909> somebody's

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
skeptical when they hear that somebody's

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.689 
skeptical when they hear that somebody's
reporting<00:04:55.229> lights<00:04:55.409> in<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.680> sky<00:04:55.919> but<00:04:56.159> perhaps

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
reporting lights in the sky but perhaps

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.820 
reporting lights in the sky but perhaps
there<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.120> logical<00:04:57.629> explanation<00:04:57.810> for<00:04:58.470> some

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
there is a logical explanation for some

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.379 
there is a logical explanation for some
of<00:04:58.949> these<00:04:59.039> light<00:04:59.280> displays<00:04:59.699> they've<00:05:00.210> been

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
of these light displays they've been

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.899 
of these light displays they've been
reported<00:05:00.930> all<00:05:01.379> over<00:05:01.439> all<00:05:02.099> over<00:05:02.159> the<00:05:02.520> country

round<00:05:05.099> it<00:05:05.460> doesn't<00:05:05.699> seem<00:05:05.819> to<00:05:05.879> be<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> particular
