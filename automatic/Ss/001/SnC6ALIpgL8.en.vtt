00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello welcome to play with me in this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 video we are going to use the elements of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.309
 the ice cream factory litigation between 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.539
 the accessories that this interesting one brings 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.750
 toy is plasticine read 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.080
 plus let's see how is this play dough 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.080
 I'm going to start with this color in pin 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.250
 when we play the plasticine we give ourselves 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.730
 mind that it has a texture in effect 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 different to the normal play doh this 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 Plasticine is much softer 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.230
 and in fact it smells different 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.420
 good this plasticine we are going to place it 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.780
 here in this template that brings this 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.780
 game 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 we put enough plasticine of this 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:09.330
 peek color 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.330
 on this left side of the template 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.610
 and on the right side we're going to place 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.610
 this other color of plasticine on white 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.080
 and good now we are going to close this 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.090
 little template and we put it in this 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.090
 building inside the ice cream machine 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.980
 we're fine and now we're going to do 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.729
 our first ice cream which will have the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.729
 Vanilla and cherry flavors 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.129
 i 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.540
 look how cute does not cause with this 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.850
 let's continue making ice cream with 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.880
 this fun ice cream factory this 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.710
 litigation now I will use this 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.710
 plasticine in yellow 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.150
 let's put this play dough in this 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.909
 template or container where we should place 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.959
 the play doh so we can do the 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.959
 ice creams that we want 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.650
 here I am going to combine this plasticine 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.670
 yellow with this plate in red color 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.280
 and strong pink and from this other side you 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.200
 I'm going to put this plasticine 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.840
 here I am now making a 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.959
 quite interesting combination because 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.380
 the blue plasticine is play dough read 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.380
 normal 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.599
 let's do with these plasticine of 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.049
 these three different colors a 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.049
 nacelle 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.900
 how cute now we are going to put him 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.560
 some decorative details to these 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.200
 sides 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.200
 let's do it with the linenses 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.500
 ah 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.850
 look how nice to really know how to provoke 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.650
 eat them but unfortunately not 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.320
 can because this play dough is not 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.290
 edible and good I hope you have them 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.060
