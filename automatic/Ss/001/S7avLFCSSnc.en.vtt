00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.320 
gonna be fighting and you can kind of
sneak<00:03:22.140> around<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:23.220> fights<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.150> back

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
sneak around the fights and get back

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.449 
sneak around the fights and get back
stabs<00:03:24.660> which<00:03:25.020> still<00:03:25.320> count<00:03:25.590> as<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.190> long

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
stabs which still count as you as long

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.820 
stabs which still count as you as long
as<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.730> are<00:03:26.910> still<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.360> sneak<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.680> way

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
as you are still in sneak and that way

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.949 
as you are still in sneak and that way
you<00:03:28.890> can<00:03:29.340> get<00:03:29.490> non<00:03:30.000> back<00:03:30.150> set<00:03:30.330> bonuses<00:03:30.750> and

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
people so it's easier to sneak because

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.260 
people so it's easier to sneak because

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
you come to a certain area and they keep

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
you come to a certain area and they keep
killing<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:54.990> don't<00:04:55.230> know<00:04:55.320> how<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.470> get

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
killing you you don't know how to get

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.290 
killing you you don't know how to get
around<00:04:55.650> them<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:56.310> can<00:04:56.460> use<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.700> detect<00:04:57.060> life

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
around them you can use to detect life

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.910 
around them you can use to detect life
suppose<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.780> see<00:04:57.930> where<00:04:58.080> everyone<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:58.830> you

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
suppose to see where everyone is so you

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.280 
suppose to see where everyone is so you
can<00:04:59.040> kind<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.280> set<00:04:59.490> up<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.700> game<00:04:59.910> plan<00:05:00.210> on<00:05:00.420> how<00:05:01.050> to

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
can kind of set up a game plan on how to

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.610 
can kind of set up a game plan on how to
take<00:05:01.980> out<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.460> enemies<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.120> yeah<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.230> I

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
take out the enemies and yeah so I

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.160 
take out the enemies and yeah so I
haven't<00:05:04.890> really<00:05:05.040> talked<00:05:05.190> about<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:06.170> weapons

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
haven't really talked about the weapons

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.750 
haven't really talked about the weapons
or<00:05:07.440> armor<00:05:07.500> or<00:05:08.040> talk<00:05:08.220> about<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.430> weapons<00:05:08.700> a

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
or armor or talk about the weapons a

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.060 
or armor or talk about the weapons a
little<00:05:08.940> bit<00:05:09.030> but<00:05:09.180> not<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.390> armor<00:05:09.720> what<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.650> use

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
little bit but not the armor what I use

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.020 
little bit but not the armor what I use
is<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.090> oven<00:05:13.040> light<00:05:14.040> armor<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.640> can<00:05:14.730> get

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
is the oven light armor that you can get

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.940 
is the oven light armor that you can get
in<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.240> game<00:05:15.420> it<00:05:16.080> looks<00:05:16.260> pretty<00:05:16.440> good<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.830> it

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
in the game it looks pretty good and it

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.290 
in the game it looks pretty good and it
makes<00:05:17.100> sense<00:05:17.280> for<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.700> role-playing<00:05:18.060> that

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
makes sense for the role-playing that

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.420 
makes sense for the role-playing that
you're<00:05:18.450> an<00:05:18.570> elven<00:05:18.870> warrior<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:20.100> for<00:05:20.310> the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
you're an elven warrior and for the

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.520 
you're an elven warrior and for the
headpiece<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:21.030> either<00:05:21.330> use<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.870> executioner

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
headpiece I either use the executioner

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.730 
headpiece I either use the executioner
hood<00:05:22.800> which<00:05:23.400> is<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.580> cloth<00:05:24.090> item<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:25.410> kind<00:05:25.680> of

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
hood which is a cloth item it kind of

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.440 
hood which is a cloth item it kind of
says<00:05:25.980> well<00:05:26.190> he's<00:05:26.460> done<00:05:26.670> dead<00:05:26.940> he<00:05:27.090> doesn't<00:05:27.330> want

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
says well he's done dead he doesn't want

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
to show his face he's ashamed or with a

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.930 
to show his face he's ashamed or with a
shrouded<00:05:29.760> hood<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:32.040> one<00:05:32.160> thing<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:32.790> the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
shrouded hood the one thing is that the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.730 
shrouded hood the one thing is that the
shouted<00:05:33.360> hood<00:05:33.600> is<00:05:33.810> lighter<00:05:34.230> armor<00:05:34.500> but<00:05:34.710> the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
shouted hood is lighter armor but the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.770 
shouted hood is lighter armor but the
executioner<00:05:35.340> hood<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:35.670> not<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.420> if<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.660> have

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
executioner hood is not so if you have

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.450 
executioner hood is not so if you have
any<00:05:36.990> light<00:05:37.290> armor<00:05:37.590> bonuses<00:05:38.040> where<00:05:38.190> we<00:05:38.280> need

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
five set or five pieces it will not work

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.100 
five set or five pieces it will not work
with<00:05:41.070> executioner's<00:05:41.820> herd<00:05:42.060> so<00:05:42.780> we<00:05:42.840> just<00:05:42.930> keep

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
with executioner's herd so we just keep

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.390 
with executioner's herd so we just keep
