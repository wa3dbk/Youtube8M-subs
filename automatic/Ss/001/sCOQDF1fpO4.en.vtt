00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:09.580
 we have our own 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.530
 pieces in three different patterns 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.480
 pattern knitted and in the end I have 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.960
 again, what you have knitted right 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.009
 or better to show it so the thread 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.419
 and the knit piece in the left hand 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.699
 In the evening we would normally have the 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.669
 mesh on the right side the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.179
 right side where the main machine is wild 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.600
 is and the edge stop knew 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.940
 the loops appear to the right, yes 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.880
 that's the right side and the same 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.670
 on the right side we go from the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.960
 actrice knitted and I will be the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 Knitting knitted message 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 The first edge mesh always had 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.110
 right knitted also right 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.420
 we now have to knit two stitches 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.220
 First I knitted and one more 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.159
 and now I can start that 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:10.570
 leave with the left needle point 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.900
 take the first stitch and with 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.270
 erich the needlepoint the second 10 you 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:28.659
 through in the book the resulting week 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:32.670
 here now the first mesh lies up 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:36.190
 the second you can see the cross 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.830
 Now we knit a stitch 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.490
 please have the next two again 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.610
 mesh 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.970
 and of these two mesh the first 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.740
 Knitted is covered on the second 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.110
 that is actually about the mesh 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.150
 overlook her again with the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.150
 left at the top the first stitch 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.810
 and pull it over the second and over 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.869
 the second goes out of here so looks here 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.269
 the first is across the second 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.770
 then the next one is loved again 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.770
 across the next stitch 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.970
 now we have a stitch but need 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.660
 his two knit them to two today 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 mesh 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:29.960
 the first over the second over 10 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:34.790
 Take care and see the second one 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.350
 here through and in the right length 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.330
 do not pull as long as it gets back 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.350
 the next time two again argued 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:52.250
 mesh the first of both over the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:58.610
 time was there a chain of stitches 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.470
 arise as well as withdrawn the see 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.660
 Actually , I would be the mesh 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.180
 because they are quite knitted 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.980
 and because they are lying across the mesh 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.190
 loops also looks like the right one 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.830
 mesh you just have to be careful not to 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.709
 To see the call to see it will be otherwise 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.250
 this is in the picture in the picture so 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:23.769
 wide and this was it so far 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.830
 are that she is just as wide 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.570
 like the knitted meshes 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.250
 look at the second link 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:40.760
 because the first one here will second c 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:43.250
 look easy and have a look 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.019
 it will not really not so tight 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.660
 not much harm so far 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:56.530
 stretch the first over the second 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.530
 pull and do it to the end 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.820
 the last few stretch as well 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.180
 10 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.440
 if it is now cut off from the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.720
 do not mesh here many 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.360
 have pulled out the last one 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.860
 Last minute, I would like her too 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.170
 They have a knitting comfort to stand 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.360
 back on the left needle and knit 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.350
 it stays that way now and with the 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.950
 nose tip I put not see them 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.300
 they spying terminate the father 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.170
 cut off and that here 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.170
 like the left stitch
