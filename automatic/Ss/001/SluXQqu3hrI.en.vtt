signs where the bad signs hopefully we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.369 
signs where the bad signs hopefully we
won't<00:00:37.969> see<00:00:38.210> any<00:00:38.420> of<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.570> bad<00:00:38.719> signs<00:00:39.019> because

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
won't see any of the bad signs because

before<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:45.949> started<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.429> video<00:00:46.550> I'm<00:00:47.329> going<00:00:47.510> to

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
before I started the video I'm going to

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.509 
before I started the video I'm going to
load<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.899> right<00:00:47.929> into<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.590> spinster<00:00:49.070> espresso

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
load it right into the spinster espresso

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:50.560 
load it right into the spinster espresso
machine<00:00:49.910> right<00:00:50.149> away

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
machine right away

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.770 
machine right away
now<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.320> speedsters<00:00:52.039> has<00:00:52.789> a<00:00:52.820> pre<00:00:53.269> infusion

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
now the speedsters has a pre infusion

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.419 
now the speedsters has a pre infusion
mode<00:00:53.809> which<00:00:54.410> we're<00:00:54.530> gonna<00:00:54.589> see<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.070> action

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
mode which we're gonna see in action

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.279 
mode which we're gonna see in action
here<00:00:55.609> not<00:00:55.760> every<00:00:55.969> espresso<00:00:56.329> machine<00:00:56.690> has<00:00:56.960> this

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
here not every espresso machine has this

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.400 
here not every espresso machine has this
but<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:58.249> we're<00:00:58.399> gonna<00:00:58.489> do<00:00:58.789> is<00:00:59.420> I'm<00:01:00.260> gonna

but what we're gonna do is I'm gonna

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.299 
but what we're gonna do is I'm gonna
drop<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.859> right<00:01:00.890> down<00:01:01.219> now<00:01:01.550> into<00:01:02.300> cream<00:01:02.629> fusion

drop it right down now into cream fusion

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.680 
drop it right down now into cream fusion
now<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.370> pre-infusion<00:01:04.820> takes<00:01:05.180> about<00:01:05.300> four<00:01:05.630> or

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
now the pre-infusion takes about four or

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
there the brew position where the pump

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.410 
there the brew position where the pump
takes<00:01:18.260> over<00:01:18.790> now<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:19.850> see<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.240> shot

takes over now you see the shot

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.150 
takes over now you see the shot
developing<00:01:20.990> there's<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.620> couple<00:01:21.800> of<00:01:21.920> streams

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
developing there's a couple of streams

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160 
developing there's a couple of streams
now<00:01:22.370> that<00:01:22.580> join<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.910> middle<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.930> what<00:01:24.050> you

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
now that join the middle and what you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.020 
now that join the middle and what you
really<00:01:24.440> want<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.770> see<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.190> stream<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.700> stay

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
really want to see is the stream to stay

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.270 
really want to see is the stream to stay
in<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.510> middle<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.350> filter<00:01:27.770> basket<00:01:27.920> as

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
in the middle of that filter basket as

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.340 
in the middle of that filter basket as
much<00:01:28.460> as<00:01:28.610> possible<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.780> don't<00:01:29.900> want<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.170> dance

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
much as possible you don't want to dance

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.260 
much as possible you don't want to dance
around<00:01:30.560> too<00:01:30.860> much<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.850> reason<00:01:32.120> why<00:01:32.210> is

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
around too much and the reason why is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.640 
around too much and the reason why is
when<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.960> middle<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.290> means<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
when it's in the middle it means the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.700 
when it's in the middle it means the
extraction<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.370> really<00:01:34.820> even<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:36.110> your<00:01:36.410> puck

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
extraction is really even and your puck

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.320 
extraction is really even and your puck
and<00:01:36.980> preparation<00:01:37.670> method<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.150> really

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
and preparation method is really

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.700 
and preparation method is really
fill<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.810> shot<00:01:40.050> now<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:42.320> yeah<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.560> when

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
fill the shot now and yeah like when

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.920 
fill the shot now and yeah like when
you're<00:01:43.830> packing<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.370> puck<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.630> even

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you're packing the puck the more even

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.620 
you're packing the puck the more even
you<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.200> with<00:01:46.410> your<00:01:46.530> dose<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.010> tamp

possibly a problem with your tamping you
saw<00:02:04.800> there<00:02:04.980> when<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> killed<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:06.060> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
saw there when I killed the when I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.670 
saw there when I killed the when I
stopped<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.570> shot<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.930> turned<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.230> pump<00:02:07.470> off

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
stopped the shot it turned the pump off

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.980 
stopped the shot it turned the pump off
the<00:02:08.580> back<00:02:08.729> pressure<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.210> relieved<00:02:09.600> almost

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
the back pressure was relieved almost

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.070 
the back pressure was relieved almost
immediately<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:12.030> Porta<00:02:12.300> filter<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
immediately from the Porta filter and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.020 
immediately from the Porta filter and
what<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.380> does<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.830> kind<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.100> evacuates

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
what that does is it kind of evacuates

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.970 
what that does is it kind of evacuates
all<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> water<00:02:15.570> from<00:02:16.080> inside<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.740> Porta

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
all the water from inside the Porta

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.470 
all the water from inside the Porta
filter<00:02:17.040> back<00:02:17.490> through<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> Machine<00:02:18.209> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
filter back through the Machine and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.660 
filter back through the Machine and
flushes<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.220> sort<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> set<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
flushes it out and you sort of set a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.980 
flushes it out and you sort of set a
little<00:02:20.910> bubbling<00:02:21.300> there<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.660> end<00:02:21.810> that's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
little bubbling there at the end that's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.320 
little bubbling there at the end that's
perfectly<00:02:22.440> normal<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.730> there<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.940> go

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
perfectly normal so there you go

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.740 
perfectly normal so there you go
