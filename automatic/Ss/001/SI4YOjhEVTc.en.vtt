thing<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.410> PC<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.070> say<00:03:35.190> yes<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
thing like it was a PC and say yes it is

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.820 
thing like it was a PC and say yes it is
underpowered<00:03:36.209> no<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.140> not<00:03:37.230> underpowered

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
underpowered no it's not underpowered

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.160 
underpowered no it's not underpowered
Italy<00:03:38.580> more<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.330> little<00:03:39.600> bit<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.050> it

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
Italy more it is a little bit but it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.540 
Italy more it is a little bit but it
could<00:03:40.290> still<00:03:40.320> hold<00:03:40.680> its<00:03:40.830> own<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.070> multi

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
could still hold its own with multi

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.110 
could still hold its own with multi
platts<00:03:41.850> on<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.570> note<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.170> as<00:03:43.549> much<00:03:44.549> as<00:03:44.790> you

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
platts on that note to as much as you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
platts on that note to as much as you
know<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.269> like<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.860> touch<00:03:47.160> screen

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
know I like the the touch screen

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.240 
know I like the the touch screen

Wii U gamepad if I don't call it the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.120 
Wii U gamepad if I don't call it the
right<00:03:52.739> name<00:03:52.950> people<00:03:53.340> flip<00:03:53.640> out<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:54.860> really<00:03:55.860> wish

Nintendo<00:03:56.790> kind<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.299> took<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.480> ps4<00:03:57.930> approach

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
Nintendo kind of took the ps4 approach

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.930 
Nintendo kind of took the ps4 approach
and<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:59.700> made<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.880> kickass<00:04:00.450> system<00:04:01.160> with<00:04:02.160> easy

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and just made a kickass system with easy

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.810 
and just made a kickass system with easy
to<00:04:03.180> program<00:04:03.450> for<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> hardware<00:04:04.440> then<00:04:05.280> then<00:04:05.640> you

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to program for a hardware then then you

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.640 
to program for a hardware then then you
add<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.330> add-ons<00:04:06.690> later<00:04:07.049> if<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.410> want<00:04:07.560> to

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
add the add-ons later if you want to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.229 
add the add-ons later if you want to
make<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.920> Wii<00:04:08.040> U<00:04:08.220> gamepad<00:04:08.459> make<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.120> in

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
make the Wii U gamepad make it in

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.090 
make the Wii U gamepad make it in
accessory<00:04:09.900> if<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.110> wanted<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.500> make<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:10.860> an

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
accessory if you wanted this make it an

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.789 
accessory if you wanted this make it an
accessory<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.940> they<00:04:12.840> focused<00:04:13.320> more<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
accessory and they focused more in the

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.740 
accessory and they focused more in the
hardware<00:04:14.070> making<00:04:14.640> more<00:04:14.880> powerful<00:04:15.390> hardware

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
hardware making more powerful hardware

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.590 
hardware making more powerful hardware
so<00:04:15.930> they<00:04:16.049> could<00:04:16.200> keep<00:04:16.350> up<00:04:16.590> with<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.919> Joneses

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
so they could keep up with the Joneses

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.270 
so they could keep up with the Joneses
I'm<00:04:18.600> sure<00:04:18.930> they're<00:04:19.140> looking<00:04:19.530> back<00:04:19.769> now<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
I'm sure they're looking back now and

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.490 
I'm sure they're looking back now and
probably<00:04:20.640> regretting<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.720> adding<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
probably regretting and adding in the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.350 
probably regretting and adding in the
Wii<00:04:22.710> U<00:04:22.890> gamepad<00:04:23.160> it's<00:04:23.520> almost<00:04:23.700> like<00:04:23.910> Nintendo

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
Wii U gamepad it's almost like Nintendo

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.570 
Wii U gamepad it's almost like Nintendo
when<00:04:24.539> they<00:04:24.630> develop<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.080> wii<00:04:25.229> was<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:25.710> shit

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
when they develop the wii was like shit

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.690 
when they develop the wii was like shit
we<00:04:26.760> need<00:04:26.940> something<00:04:27.180> we

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
we need something we

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.160 
we need something we
add<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.000> whole<00:04:28.120> motion<00:04:28.330> control<00:04:28.810> thing<00:04:28.840> with

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
add the whole motion control thing with

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.450 
add the whole motion control thing with
the<00:04:29.260> week<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.770> hell<00:04:29.950> can<00:04:30.130> we<00:04:30.160> do<00:04:30.310> with

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
the week what the hell can we do with

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.550 
the week what the hell can we do with
the<00:04:30.580> wii<00:04:30.730> u<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.750> make<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.080> another<00:04:32.260> hit<00:04:32.380> like

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
the wii u to make it another hit like

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.920 
the wii u to make it another hit like
that<00:04:32.790> should<00:04:33.790> we<00:04:33.880> go<00:04:34.030> for<00:04:34.270> ultra<00:04:34.630> powerful

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that should we go for ultra powerful

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.080 
that should we go for ultra powerful
hardware<00:04:35.410> they're<00:04:35.560> like<00:04:35.710> yeah<00:04:35.920> we<00:04:36.700> gotta<00:04:36.910> do

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
hardware they're like yeah we gotta do

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.490 
hardware they're like yeah we gotta do
something<00:04:37.480> different<00:04:37.870> just<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:38.080> with<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
something different just like with the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.040 
something different just like with the
wii<00:04:38.680> because<00:04:39.100> that's<00:04:39.280> what<00:04:39.430> made<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.700> work<00:04:40.050> but

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
wii because that's what made it work but

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.630 
wii because that's what made it work but
they<00:04:41.170> didn't<00:04:41.410> factor<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:41.980> that<00:04:42.010> times<00:04:42.490> have

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
they didn't factor in that times have

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.210 
they didn't factor in that times have
changed<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.450> you<00:04:43.540> know<00:04:43.990> those<00:04:44.260> casuals<00:04:44.860> have

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
changed and you know those casuals have

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.250 
changed and you know those casuals have
moved<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.820> something<00:04:46.210> different<00:04:46.420> now<00:04:47.020> with

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
moved on to something different now with

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.560 
moved on to something different now with
that<00:04:47.290> being<00:04:47.590> said<00:04:48.010> though<00:04:48.670> you<00:04:49.150> notice<00:04:49.540> that

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
that being said though you notice that

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.360 
that being said though you notice that
little<00:04:49.810> thing<00:04:50.260> he<00:04:50.470> threw<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.980> at<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.130> end

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
little thing he threw it at the end

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.460 
little thing he threw it at the end
right<00:04:51.550> there<00:04:51.610> I'll<00:04:51.940> read<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.210> again<00:04:52.470> we're

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
right there I'll read it again we're

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.290 
right there I'll read it again we're
going<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.890> look<00:04:54.310> at<00:04:54.550> getting<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:55.060> game

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
going to look at getting the game

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.870 
going to look at getting the game
running<00:04:55.840> on<00:04:56.140> with<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.860> then<00:04:57.490> we'll<00:04:57.640> make

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
running on with you and then we'll make

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.240 
running on with you and then we'll make
decisions<00:04:58.540> depending<00:04:59.110> on<00:04:59.230> how<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.710> goes<00:04:59.980> and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
decisions depending on how that goes and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.120 
decisions depending on how that goes and
what<00:05:00.850> we<00:05:01.000> see<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.390> market<00:05:01.900> possibilities<00:05:02.860> are

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
what we see the market possibilities are

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.840 
what we see the market possibilities are
doing<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.920> see<00:05:06.130> what<00:05:06.280> I'm<00:05:06.400> saying<00:05:06.430> right

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
doing you see what I'm saying right

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.080 
doing you see what I'm saying right
there<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.990> here<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.890> other<00:05:09.010> thing<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:09.400> he

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
there so here is the other thing that he

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.330 
there so here is the other thing that he
kind<00:05:10.360> of<00:05:10.480> took<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.440> words<00:05:11.830> out<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.160> my<00:05:12.250> mouth

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
kind of took the words out of my mouth

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.610 
kind of took the words out of my mouth
is<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:14.050> if<00:05:14.290> a<00:05:15.100> platform<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.060> moneymaker

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
is that if a platform is a moneymaker

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.590 
is that if a platform is a moneymaker
basically<00:05:17.620> what<00:05:17.800> he<00:05:17.860> was<00:05:18.070> saying<00:05:18.340> is<00:05:18.580> this<00:05:18.850> you
