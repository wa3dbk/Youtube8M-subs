00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.410 

these<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.160> types<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.550> things<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.090> is

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
these are types of things like this is

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.660 
these are types of things like this is
just<00:02:52.450> set<00:02:52.900> at<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> certain<00:02:53.380> rate<00:02:53.530> those<00:02:54.100> are<00:02:54.340> the

just set at a certain rate those are the
kind<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:54.940> functionality<00:02:55.420> where<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.020> would<00:02:56.140> be

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
kind of functionality where it would be

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.360 
kind of functionality where it would be
whatever<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:57.090> wanted<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:59.130> in<00:03:00.130> that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
whatever you wanted it to be in that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:13.340 
whatever you wanted it to be in that
case<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:03.520> one

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.640 

I'm<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.520> look<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.120> red<00:03:16.910> thing<00:03:17.910> here

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
I'm going to look at the red thing here

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.900 
I'm going to look at the red thing here
we've<00:03:19.650> set<00:03:19.950> these<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.760> they're

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
we've set these up so that they're

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.270 
we've set these up so that they're
different<00:03:21.120> rates<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.810> zoom<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.470> assume<00:03:22.950> that

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
different rates of zoom so I assume that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.870 
different rates of zoom so I assume that
I<00:03:23.460> think<00:03:24.350> fifty<00:03:25.350> percent<00:03:26.360> then<00:03:27.360> greater<00:03:28.880> see

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
I think fifty percent then greater see

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.850 
I think fifty percent then greater see
blue<00:03:30.270> where<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.750> wanted<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.350> zoom<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.770> all

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
blue where you wanted to zoom and all

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.250 
blue where you wanted to zoom and all
i'm<00:03:32.100> doing<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.580> yeah<00:03:32.910> yeah<00:03:33.480> i'm<00:03:33.660> looking<00:03:34.140> at

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
buttons to zoom to different degrees and

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.550 
buttons to zoom to different degrees and
then<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.310> hit<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.760> go<00:03:39.000> back<00:03:39.210> so<00:03:40.110> let's<00:03:40.350> say<00:03:40.530> I

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.450 
to pan the entire image I just set it up
here<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> tab<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.160> look

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
here so that I have a tab and I look

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.970 
here so that I have a tab and I look
from<00:03:59.960> looking<00:04:00.960> over<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.350> left<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
from looking over to the left and the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.570 
from looking over to the left and the
image<00:04:02.190> then<00:04:02.550> moves<00:04:02.850> as<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.770> look<00:04:04.770> around<00:04:04.920> left

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
image then moves as I look around left

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.850 
image then moves as I look around left
if<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.910> look<00:04:06.060> up<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.450> top<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.110> which<00:04:07.560> moves

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
if I look up to the top and which moves

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.000 
if I look up to the top and which moves
on<00:04:08.160> my<00:04:08.340> behalf<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.000> these<00:04:09.930> are<00:04:10.140> all<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.560> speed

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
on my behalf so these are all the speed

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.460 
on my behalf so these are all the speed
the<00:04:11.700> zoom<00:04:12.240> all<00:04:12.600> those<00:04:12.750> types<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.140> things<00:04:13.200> are

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
the zoom all those types of things are

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.960 
the zoom all those types of things are
just<00:04:13.530> things<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.130> would<00:04:14.280> manage<00:04:14.550> and

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
just things that you would manage and

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.190 
just things that you would manage and
the<00:04:15.030> software<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:16.400> capability<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.989> they<00:04:18.989> know

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
the software but capability is they know

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.020 
the software but capability is they know
exactly<00:04:19.350> where<00:04:19.890> you're<00:04:19.980> looking<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.700> so

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
exactly where you're looking and so

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.850 
exactly where you're looking and so
whatever<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:21.540> programmed<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.530> they

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
whatever you programmed it to do they

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.140 
whatever you programmed it to do they
started<00:04:23.370> looking<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:25.020> can<00:04:25.200> do

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.920 

and<00:04:29.150> then<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.810> last<00:04:30.020> game<00:04:30.610> also<00:04:31.610> fun<00:04:32.150> this<00:04:32.780> is

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
and then the last game also fun this is

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.219 
and then the last game also fun this is
just<00:04:33.110> illustrating<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.220> blurry<00:04:35.000> screen<00:04:35.300> and

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
just illustrating a blurry screen and

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.920 
just illustrating a blurry screen and
then<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.919> clarity<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:37.699> really<00:04:38.180> sort<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.720> in<00:04:38.810> an

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
then the clarity is really sort of in an

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.800 
then the clarity is really sort of in an
area<00:04:39.139> around<00:04:39.680> my<00:04:40.000> mission<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.419> way<00:04:41.570> vision

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
area around my mission the way vision

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.909 
area around my mission the way vision
works<00:04:42.259> is<00:04:43.009> such<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:45.169> actually<00:04:45.380> have

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
works is such that you actually have

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.279 
works is such that you actually have
clarity<00:04:46.490> in<00:04:46.610> your<00:04:46.639> vision<00:04:47.120> in<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.389> area<00:04:47.810> at

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
clarity in your vision in a area at

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.260 
clarity in your vision in a area at
arm's<00:04:48.860> length<00:04:48.949> about<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.490> size<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:50.060> your

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
arm's length about the size of your

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.980 
arm's length about the size of your
thumb<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.910> this<00:04:53.120> is<00:04:53.300> just<00:04:53.539> really<00:04:53.690> to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
thumb and this is just really to

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.520 
thumb and this is just really to
illustrate<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:55.030> computer<00:04:56.030> knows<00:04:56.530> every

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
illustrate that computer knows every

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.760 
illustrate that computer knows every
time<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.740> look<00:04:58.660> it's<00:04:59.660> clear

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
time I look it's clear

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.999 
time I look it's clear
and<00:05:01.069> the<00:05:01.400> m's<00:05:01.639> then<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.330> get<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:02.539> select<00:05:03.169> them

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
and the m's then you get to select them

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.980 
and the m's then you get to select them
glancing<00:05:04.939> at<00:05:05.089> them<00:05:05.240> i<00:05:05.360> think<00:05:05.569> it's<00:05:05.719> set<00:05:05.960> for

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
glancing at them i think it's set for

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.999 
glancing at them i think it's set for
maybe<00:05:06.379> one<00:05:06.619> or<00:05:06.740> two<00:05:06.800> seconds<00:05:08.439> and<00:05:09.439> then<00:05:09.770> this

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
maybe one or two seconds and then this

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.129 
maybe one or two seconds and then this
of<00:05:10.159> course<00:05:10.189> is

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.840 

eyes<00:05:15.120> moving<00:05:16.120> back<00:05:16.509> and<00:05:16.689> forth
