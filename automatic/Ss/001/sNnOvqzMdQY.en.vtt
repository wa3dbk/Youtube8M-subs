00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 we just got the alcatel one touch idol 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.380
 mini received and still have number 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.950
 devices that we can use for a while 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.380
 compare 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 one of them is the sony xperia m and the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.820
 sony xperia m can own two tens 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.130
 more sun 480 euros tech many of the 60 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.840
 for the car count and in terms of specifications 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.550
 she is not that far apart 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 so interesting to see which one 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.110
 Peter's name has in terms of specifications 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
 also very one touch idol mini 4.3 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.430
 inch screen VGA resolution the Sony has 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.239
 4 inch screen also five years 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.250
 resolution 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.050
 actual feel again VGA resolution at 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 the ben 5 megapixel camera at one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.590
 dual-core processor but the xperia m that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.930
 works with two cry cores while the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.450
 one touch idol mini 2 arm cortex a7 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.340
 cores thus has a paper is that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 slightly slower 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.059
 furthermore they are both almost almost 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.610
 has big 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.350
 the xperia m is slightly thicker perhaps 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.120
 one touch idol mini is just a bit longer 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.500
 but actually that difference is not even 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 so great for sure when you consider that the one 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.820
 touch idol mini a much big screen 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.969
 So for that matter they are 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.710
 fairly similar to each other and in terms of design 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.510
 then the mini finally find something out 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610
 better just because that edges around it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.750
 screen are a bit smaller and the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.790
 war is buttons under the screen 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 so you don't have room either 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.030
 lost evil buttons on the screen 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 so you would be in almost the same device 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.390
 you just have a big screen 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430
 and even more space on that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 screen so that is worth something 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 further is the because i would be the way 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.530
 slightly thinner it just looks good 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 nice look on the back is a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.580
 kind of hair lines pattern 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.409
 it feels reasonable to his smith semi 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.750
 you would have semi-glossy plastic 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.299
 can say it is not like van 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 samsung cores of the galaxy s4 and the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.780
 derivative thereof for example it is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.189
 also not as good as xperia plastic 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.360
 m that feels that screws to what 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.939
 more comfortable in the hand 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.229
 just because of the size we think 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.270
 the one touch idol mini we already have some fun 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.860
 the biggest difference between these two 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.119
 device is the screen not only because 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.850
 that of the bank touch idol mini you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.009
 larger with 4.3 inches versus 4 inches 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.570
 but also because it is an ubs panel on 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 it 's a mini that has its own 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.840
 management panel which stands for better 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.850
 viewing angles and more natural colors too 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 more vibrant colors and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 the xperia m has a normal has one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.390
 panel that you actually notice 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.620
 the viewing angle of the one touch idol mini 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.300
 is a lot better 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.340
 the clothes that are much livelier and 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.350
 the screen is slightly brighter it sees 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.640
 just much nicer out of the screen 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.190
 Light also deeper 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.530
 a bit closer under the glass layer whatever 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.760
 All in all, it is an advantage 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.530
 screen of the one touch idol mini je 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.100
 just a lot better than that of xperia 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.150
 m 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.569
 and that is a big advantage of it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.950
 device in terms of interface they are both 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.390
 equipped with android jelly bean 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.920
 hotel has quite a lot there and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.600
 adjusted the interface in itself 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.610
 nice and tight, it is completely full 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.860
 with spring party software 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.030
 so all programs that almost nobody 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.530
 will use 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.180
 therefore he becomes a day is just something 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.190
 to wear and that is a pity 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.660
 the xperia m that does not have it we stand 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 a few sony programs yourself 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.670
 be kept within the limits 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.590
 and takes face a from sony who is slightly 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.660
 less adapted also graphically and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.860
 in terms of structure it does not make it that whole 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560
 much out 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.450
 one touch idol mini that has in addition 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.810
 in a slower process , namely one 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.850
 mediatek processor with two gore-tex a7 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.010
 cores the ibm has a qualcomm 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.120
 snapdragon s4 plus processor with two 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.769
 shout cores 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.600
 you really don't notice a marinda conversation 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.250
 difference though because interface from 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.450
 xperia m is slightly lighter 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.100
 stays that through the interface and whatever 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.510
 smoother if you have heavier programs 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.160
 boot if you go browser if you 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.989
 youtube movies is watching the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.090
 loading times actually almost the same and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.440
 so you do not live so much disadvantage to the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.030
 one touch idol mini 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.250
 we room they have almost 5 megapixels 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.930
 camera at the not very thunderous 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.190
 you don't need them both without a room 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.070
 buy to refresh and not so whole 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.930
 great in xp and even more nfc 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.239
 see here on the back and fg is handy 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.220
 but it is definitely a deal breaker 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.049
 us therefore relates to about the xperia m 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.850
 not to buy though then for that you 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.109
 of the device is natural and as we 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.970
 then just go all adding up 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.670
 then the one touch idol mini i started 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.530
 just what better phone as far as we are concerned 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.109
 the screen is better and looks just like something 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.370
 faster and find the design a little better 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.019
 in addition, the price of 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.130
 the one touch idol mini is slightly lower 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.170
 then that of the xperia m and 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.900
 yes you are actually crazy about sunning 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.400
 to buy the xperia m from these two 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.560
 Of course Sony has what greater 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.300
 name and maybe it's just that 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.680
 is a bit more reliable 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.540
 is so that on what better with updates from 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.489
 alcatel but that is actually something 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.720
 only real advantage of dough xperia him 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.720
 the real thing about the one touch idol mini
