00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.510
 virus map and third bios map 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.360
 all when by a window equal to 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.220
 this window has to 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.340
 options have to be equal to that and 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.450
 they do not come together at all 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.000

 which is in the background 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.850
 or that already once painted in the background we're going to 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.620
 operate the first section 'la la la' 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.580

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.830
 and with all 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.099
 ok I would like to remove the sound but I 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.710
 makes it very popular so for that 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.160

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:56.990

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.930
 scene control 1f paste 7 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.310
 we are going to 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.190
 this layer is onion paper 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.170
 now against you see how we do the same 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.930
 for a 17 and paste onion onion 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.910
 is to put you exactly the same 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.780
 efe 7 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.780
 and cappa 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.330
 okay 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.150
 we can modify the speed so that 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:34.030
 it's not going so fast or so slow and now 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.030
 I reassure myself because it looks more normal 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.880
 and they have a control to prove 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.880
 scene and they saw a little bit fast 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.000
 or another 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.230
 now very slow 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.230
 and a lot is good 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.620
 I like it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.760
 if they want to save it for as good with 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.400

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.329
 if you want to save it to use it 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.479
 again in flash and it does like several 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:26.380
 other animations and give save but 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:31.090
