all<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.649> need<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.610> progress

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
all you really need you can progress

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
all you really need you can progress
your<00:01:48.119> towel<00:01:48.509> hangs<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.840> exactly<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
your towel hangs just exactly as you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620 
your towel hangs just exactly as you
would<00:01:49.860> progress<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.430> pull-ups<00:01:50.880> where<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
would progress your pull-ups where you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.050 
would progress your pull-ups where you
could<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.110> reclined<00:01:52.799> style<00:01:53.340> body<00:01:53.700> rows

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
could go with reclined style body rows

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.749 
could go with reclined style body rows
bent<00:01:54.689> legs<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.130> straight<00:01:56.490> legs

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
bent legs then go on to straight legs

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.179 
bent legs then go on to straight legs
then<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.899> L<00:01:58.140> say<00:01:58.469> I'll<00:01:58.619> pull<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
then you have L say I'll pull up so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.620 
then you have L say I'll pull up so
every<00:01:59.490> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.790> progression<00:02:00.149> whatever

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
every kind of progression whatever

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
every kind of progression whatever
progressions<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.439> use<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.950> pull-ups<00:02:02.219> fit

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
progressions you use for pull-ups fit

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.789 
progressions you use for pull-ups fit
perfectly<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.479> grip<00:02:03.689> training<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> couple<00:02:04.649> of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
perfectly with grip training a couple of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.260 
perfectly with grip training a couple of
key<00:02:04.979> points<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> want<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> keep<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.090> mind

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
key points that you want to keep in mind

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.109 
key points that you want to keep in mind
when<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:06.930> using<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.649> towels<00:02:08.160> first<00:02:08.910> off

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
when you're using your towels first off

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.360 
when you're using your towels first off
it's<00:02:09.690> important<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.379> recognize<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> anatomy

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it's important to recognize the anatomy

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
it's important to recognize the anatomy
of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> hand<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.879> lot<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> people<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
of the hand a lot of people have what I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.450 
of the hand a lot of people have what I
call<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> fin

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
call a fin

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.340 
call a fin
dominant<00:02:14.060> grip<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.780> when<00:02:14.900> they<00:02:14.990> grab<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
dominant grip so when they grab the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.890 
dominant grip so when they grab the
towel<00:02:15.950> they're<00:02:16.490> thinking<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.180> grabbing<00:02:17.510> with

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
towel they're thinking of grabbing with

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.330 
towel they're thinking of grabbing with
their<00:02:18.050> fingers<00:02:18.380> but<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:18.740> more<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.100> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
their fingers but there's more to the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.980 
their fingers but there's more to the
grip<00:02:19.550> than<00:02:19.970> just<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.330> fingers<00:02:20.630> there's<00:02:20.810> also

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
grip than just the fingers there's also

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.890 
grip than just the fingers there's also
the<00:02:21.260> palm<00:02:21.620> there's<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:23.120> joint<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> thumb

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the palm there's this joint in the thumb

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.840 
the palm there's this joint in the thumb
and<00:02:24.110> then<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.040> what<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.220> recommend<00:02:25.700> is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
and then here so what I recommend is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.940 
and then here so what I recommend is
when<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> grab<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.300> towel<00:02:26.660> grab<00:02:27.410> with<00:02:27.800> your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
when you grab a towel grab with your

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.940 
when you grab a towel grab with your
palm<00:02:28.190> first<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.900> close<00:02:30.410> your<00:02:30.440> fingers

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
palm first and then close your fingers

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
palm first and then close your fingers
around<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.340> you'll<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.880> lot<00:02:32.240> more<00:02:32.440> power

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
around it you'll get a lot more power

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.710 
around it you'll get a lot more power
from<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.550> lot<00:02:34.700> more<00:02:34.730> muscle<00:02:35.180> activation

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
from it and a lot more muscle activation

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.440 
from it and a lot more muscle activation
in<00:02:35.870> your<00:02:36.230> forearms<00:02:36.770> also<00:02:37.700> speaking<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.150> muscle

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
in your forearms also speaking of muscle

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.490 
in your forearms also speaking of muscle
activation<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:39.110> pays<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.860> practice<00:02:41.500> using

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
activation it pays to practice using

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.700 
activation it pays to practice using
your<00:02:42.740> grip<00:02:43.310> muscles<00:02:43.870> practicing<00:02:44.870> having<00:02:45.530> them

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
your grip muscles practicing having them

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.430 
your grip muscles practicing having them
tense<00:02:46.450> along<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.750> rest<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.050> your<00:02:48.200> arm

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
tense along with the rest of your arm

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.830 
tense along with the rest of your arm
throughout<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.730> day<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.150> before<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.600> start

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
throughout the day and before you start

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.990 
throughout the day and before you start
the<00:02:50.990> exercise<00:02:51.020> because<00:02:51.800> again<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.250> lot<00:02:52.880> of

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
the exercise because again a lot of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660 
the exercise because again a lot of
times<00:02:53.210> we<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.690> weak<00:02:54.230> hands<00:02:54.590> weak<00:02:55.130> forearms

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
times we have weak hands weak forearms

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.980 
times we have weak hands weak forearms
so<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.210> jump<00:02:56.510> right<00:02:56.600> into<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
so if you just jump right into the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.410 
so if you just jump right into the
exercise<00:02:57.410> your<00:02:57.920> muscles<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.640> mind<00:02:58.880> might<00:02:59.300> be

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
exercise your muscles your mind might be

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.880 
exercise your muscles your mind might be
saying<00:02:59.570> what<00:02:59.750> what's<00:03:00.260> going<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.590> where<00:03:00.770> do<00:03:00.830> you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
saying what what's going on where do you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.800 
saying what what's going on where do you
want<00:03:01.070> tension<00:03:01.460> what<00:03:01.610> am<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.790> trying<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.270> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
want tension what am I trying to do so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.140 
want tension what am I trying to do so
laying<00:03:03.230> down<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.950> neural<00:03:04.190> framework<00:03:04.640> for

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
laying down the the neural framework for

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.300 
laying down the the neural framework for
having<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.600> tension<00:03:06.020> by<00:03:06.170> flexing<00:03:06.860> your

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
having that tension by flexing your

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.670 
having that tension by flexing your
forearms<00:03:07.850> can<00:03:08.030> go<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> long<00:03:08.390> way<00:03:08.630> as<00:03:08.780> well<00:03:09.020> last

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
forearms can go a long way as well last

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.650 
forearms can go a long way as well last
but<00:03:09.920> not<00:03:10.040> least<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.520> lot<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:10.880> times<00:03:11.210> when<00:03:11.480> people

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
but not least a lot of times when people

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.630 
but not least a lot of times when people
are<00:03:11.900> hanging<00:03:12.230> from<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.530> towel<00:03:12.740> they<00:03:13.310> start

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
are hanging from the towel they start

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.790 
are hanging from the towel they start
off<00:03:13.760> where<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.240> towels<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.720> hanging<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:15.200> they

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
off where the towels is hanging and they

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.710 
off where the towels is hanging and they
just<00:03:16.010> grab<00:03:16.190> like<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:17.360> works<00:03:17.540> pretty

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
just grab like that that works pretty

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.060 
just grab like that that works pretty
well<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.080> if<00:03:18.200> you're<00:03:18.290> having<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.590> little<00:03:18.920> bit

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
well but if you're having a little bit

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.200 
well but if you're having a little bit
of<00:03:19.190> extra<00:03:19.490> trouble<00:03:19.730> with<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.180> I

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
of extra trouble with it what I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.780 
of extra trouble with it what I
recommend<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.840> start<00:03:21.530> off<00:03:21.680> with<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.340> slight

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
recommend is start off with a slight

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.200 
recommend is start off with a slight
twist<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.680> towel<00:03:24.920> what<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.730> does<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.090> it
