00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.160 
I'm going to use a coordinating paper
and<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> cut<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.950> ban<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:25.020> going

and I'm going to cut a ban and I'm going
to<00:01:25.229> place<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> left<00:01:26.430> hand<00:01:26.700> side<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to place it on the left hand side and I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
to place it on the left hand side and I
believe<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.840> band<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.590> four<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
believe that band was like a four and a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.660 
believe that band was like a four and a
half<00:01:29.630> by<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.049> four<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> quarter<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.490> by

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
half by or four and a quarter kind of by

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.289 
half by or four and a quarter kind of by
eleven<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> half<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.040> way<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:36.119> will

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
eleven and a half so that way it will

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.940 
eleven and a half so that way it will
fit<00:01:36.600> nicely<00:01:36.899> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.040> left<00:01:38.430> hand<00:01:38.610> side<00:01:38.759> there

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
fit nicely on the left hand side there

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
fit nicely on the left hand side there
so<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> place<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.520> door<00:01:41.970> late<00:01:42.149> now
