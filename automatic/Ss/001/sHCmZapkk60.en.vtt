between the HP dm4 and the DM 40 I

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.680 
between the HP dm4 and the DM 40 I
believe<00:03:29.450> is<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:31.110> got<00:03:31.230> separate

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
believe is that it's got separate

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.710 
believe is that it's got separate
buttons<00:03:33.690> here<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:35.820> they<00:03:35.970> produce<00:03:36.180> before

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
buttons here that they produce before

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.850 
buttons here that they produce before
was<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:38.820> know<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.240> was<00:03:39.810> all<00:03:39.990> multi-touch

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
was all you know it was all multi-touch

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.690 
was all you know it was all multi-touch
and<00:03:41.100> there<00:03:41.220> was<00:03:41.310> no<00:03:42.440> dedicated<00:03:43.440> buttons<00:03:44.130> here

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
and there was no dedicated buttons here

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.730 
and there was no dedicated buttons here
and<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.570> seemed<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.900> problem<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.440> most<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
and that seemed a problem for most of

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.530 
and that seemed a problem for most of
the<00:03:46.830> users<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.340> HP<00:03:47.700> did<00:03:47.910> listen<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.390> their

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the users and HP did listen to their

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.770 
the users and HP did listen to their
customers<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:50.430> they<00:03:50.640> created<00:03:51.090> two<00:03:51.270> separate

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
customers and they created two separate

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.500 
customers and they created two separate
buttons<00:03:52.020> here<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.600> obviously<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
buttons here and obviously you have the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.180 
buttons here and obviously you have the
finger<00:03:57.510> scanner<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.770> tells<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.070> it's

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
finger scanner and it tells you it's

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.940 
finger scanner and it tells you it's
windows<00:03:59.459> 7<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> Intel<00:04:00.510> Core<00:04:00.750> i5

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
processor and also we can go to the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.830 
processor and also we can go to the
computer<00:04:07.050> properties<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:08.160> look<00:04:08.370> at<00:04:08.840> further

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
computer properties to look at further

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:20.789 
computer properties to look at further

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.020 

and<00:04:21.880> there<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.150> see<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:24.170> it<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:25.030> 5.3

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
and there you see that it is a 5.3

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
guy installed memory on this side you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.220 
guy installed memory on this side you
are<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.660> CD<00:04:41.960> arrived<00:04:42.290> I'm<00:04:42.620> sorry<00:04:44.050> there<00:04:45.050> you

have two USB switch I'm using one and
and<00:04:49.550> that's<00:04:49.790> where<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.090> insert<00:04:50.360> your<00:04:50.419> charger

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.430 

so<00:04:55.040> that's<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.610> look<00:04:56.060> from<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.450> sides<00:04:56.750> there's

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
so that's a look from the sides there's

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.260 
so that's a look from the sides there's
the<00:04:57.680> 14<00:04:58.070> inch<00:04:58.280> screen<00:05:00.520> on<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.730> back<00:05:01.850> there<00:05:02.120> is

pretty much it on this side here is the
laptop<00:05:44.330> opened<00:05:45.260> up<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:47.150> then<00:05:47.270> it<00:05:47.390> can<00:05:47.570> hear

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
laptop opened up and then it can hear

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.370 
laptop opened up and then it can hear
the<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.350> can<00:05:48.470> see<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.970> 14<00:05:49.970> inch<00:05:50.380> widescreen

the you can see the 14 inch widescreen

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.900 
the you can see the 14 inch widescreen
there<00:05:53.979> and<00:05:54.979> when<00:05:55.160> you<00:05:55.250> come<00:05:55.460> down<00:05:55.669> your

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.650 

as<00:06:05.120> I<00:06:05.270> showed<00:06:05.509> you<00:06:05.539> earlier<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:07.360> mouse<00:06:08.360> pad

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
as I showed you earlier the mouse pad

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.120 
as I showed you earlier the mouse pad
with<00:06:09.349> the<00:06:09.590> dedicated<00:06:10.039> buttons<00:06:11.800> this<00:06:12.800> computer

with the dedicated buttons this computer

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.390 
with the dedicated buttons this computer
is<00:06:13.280> relatively<00:06:13.910> very<00:06:14.180> fast<00:06:14.710> let's<00:06:15.710> open<00:06:16.039> up<00:06:16.160> a

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
is relatively very fast let's open up a

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.659 
is relatively very fast let's open up a
program<00:06:17.300> here<00:06:17.780> let's<00:06:17.990> open<00:06:18.289> up<00:06:21.669> Microsoft

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
program here let's open up Microsoft

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.770 
program here let's open up Microsoft
Word<00:06:22.970> if<00:06:23.210> we<00:06:23.360> can<00:06:23.569> so<00:06:23.990> I<00:06:24.020> can<00:06:24.139> now<00:06:24.410> show<00:06:24.650> you

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
Word if we can so I can now show you

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:34.770 
Word if we can so I can now show you
typing

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.480 

there<00:06:35.780> you<00:06:35.930> go<00:06:36.700> so<00:06:37.700> I<00:06:37.730> was<00:06:37.850> relatively<00:06:38.210> fast<00:06:39.490> so

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
there you go so I was relatively fast so

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.530 
there you go so I was relatively fast so
one<00:06:41.950> one<00:06:42.950> feature<00:06:43.100> that<00:06:43.280> those<00:06:43.550> laptop<00:06:44.000> has<00:06:44.240> it

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
one one feature that those laptop has it

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.600 
one one feature that those laptop has it
can<00:06:44.720> disable<00:06:45.100> the<00:06:46.480> mouse<00:06:47.480> pad<00:06:47.870> and<00:06:48.610> that's

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
can disable the mouse pad and that's

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.580 
can disable the mouse pad and that's
useful<00:06:49.850> when<00:06:50.180> you're<00:06:50.300> typing<00:06:50.600> especially<00:06:51.410> and

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
useful when you're typing especially and

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.380 
useful when you're typing especially and
you<00:06:52.010> typing<00:06:52.400> something<00:06:52.700> and<00:06:53.060> all<00:06:53.180> of<00:06:53.240> a<00:06:53.360> sudden

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
you typing something and all of a sudden

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.930 
you typing something and all of a sudden
your<00:06:53.810> mouse<00:06:53.990> gets<00:06:54.290> in<00:06:54.410> the<00:06:54.500> way<00:06:54.650> so<00:06:55.640> what<00:06:55.790> the
