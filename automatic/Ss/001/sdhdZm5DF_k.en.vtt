00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 This subtitle is provided by the PLoT subtitle group 

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:11.728
 I have an extra bed, but I still use Spike as a dog. 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.940
 This picture is awkward 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.499
 But I never thought about checking if there was an intruder at home. 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.680
 So for centuries, they didn’t use magic to send away the winter. 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.680
 This is tradition 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.007
 Tradition, tradition 

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.043
 I didn't finish things in the order of her list. 

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:28.278
 Don't worry, snow has already turned itself off. 

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.012
 theme song 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.640
 It seems that you have changed your mind. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.816
 I decided to go out without wearing it. 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 Oh, not the only one who doesn’t know 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.852
 Which team should you join the pony? 

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.187
 Look, the camera is here 

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:38.555
 This means that there are human beings watching 

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:42.392
 Obviously the best background horse failed to handle her duties. 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 As a pony that can't sit still for a moment. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.862
 Pingqi party must know how to keep a posture 

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:47.264
 Shining 

00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:49.866
 This is Ruirui, doing her job as usual. 

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.860
 Hey, cherries, can you lend me a hoof? 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.236
 Ferret is a carnivore 

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.172
 Waltz, don't harass the poor little mouse. 

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:58.341
 If you have to use a hoe or plow to clean the snow, you will be mad. 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 Get a wrong cute mark and prosthetic 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.245
 Probably can't help your emotions. 

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:04.381
 Run, oh, otherwise those ghosts will catch you. 

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:07.250
 Just wearing a skate on a skate can make a whole piece of ice? 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.119
 Bad gravity 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.587
 You can take off now. 

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:11.955
 Are they already in the air? 

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:13.523
 I forgot, no wings 

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:16.126
 Look at yourself soon, Princess Sissi 

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:18.061
 The reference to Canada in the animation 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 I know what we are talking about now. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.666
 But here her quick organization ability is too strong. 

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.602
 In addition, Ruirui seems to have broken without a doubt - 

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:27.170
 Traditional 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.120
 Pingqi sent and found a greeting 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.307
 But she didn't even look back 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.900
 I started skating very early. 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.260
 Hey, would you like to help me? 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.320
 Can I? 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 Can you? 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.680
 Can I? 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.149
 Can you? 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.950
 book 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.084
 You may laugh now 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.700
 But they need hours to put 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.721
 Pingqi pie squats down from the corner 

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:45.989
 Recycling laughter 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.826
 Hibernation of animals can save energy and eat less food 

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.762
 Thank you, Jordan, another educational piece that was imposed. 

00:01:52.762 --> 00:02:00.036
 Guess what kind of furry little animal I wake up? 

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:03.106
 I must praise the honest and diligent pony who is not working at all. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 This is likely to end in a disaster. 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.343
 If you don’t interrupt them, 

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:07.777
 Talent association 

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:11.815
 Every year in the United States, many people lose their lives because they are trapped in the snow. 

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:14.684
 Oh, don’t pull it, they can’t dig themselves out so soon. 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.300
 In fact, you are good at many things. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.723
 In addition to making nests, skating, awakening animals 

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:22.225
 In fact, I’m doing a good job of waking up animals. 

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.895
 I also count on my incredible speech to inspire Ma’s heart. 

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.129
 Can you be modest? 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.497
 quickly 

00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:31.568
 I am sure there will be some bans on this in the Magic Management Charter. 

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.870
 There is something that bothers me in a whole set. 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.273
 Isn't the ice in the country of the horse not made by itself? 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.720
 Just sunbathe for a few days in the sunshine of Celastia 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.210
 Almost everything will melt away 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.020
 If there are fewer ponies moving the snow 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.800
 The vacant pony can help with some more important things. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.315
 They can send away the winter faster. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.560
 Yes, wake up the animal 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.353
 It’s much harder to tie all the ropes together. 

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.023
 I swear that the Pingqi school knows that we are watching. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.820
 Hey, hey, would you like to help me? 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.280
 really 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.620
 Do not
