00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
think the cost and there's plenty of

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.919 
think the cost and there's plenty of
other<00:00:14.219> girls<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.610> YouTube<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.480> do

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
other girls on YouTube that actually do

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.779 
other girls on YouTube that actually do
makeup<00:00:16.289> artistry<00:00:16.710> full-time<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
makeup artistry full-time and the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
makeup artistry full-time and the
tutorials<00:00:18.270> are<00:00:18.359> probably<00:00:18.690> gonna<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.260> lot

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
tutorials are probably gonna be a lot

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.320 
tutorials are probably gonna be a lot
better<00:00:20.010> than<00:00:20.130> mine<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.970> thought<00:00:21.150> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
better than mine but I just thought I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
better than mine but I just thought I
would<00:00:21.539> show<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.500> did<00:00:22.740> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
would show you kind of how I did it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.929 
would show you kind of how I did it
because<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.640> my<00:00:23.760> subscribers

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
because I know a lot of my subscribers

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.779 
because I know a lot of my subscribers
of<00:00:24.390> my<00:00:24.420> age<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.230> probably<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.279> access

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
of my age and probably don't have access

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.370 
of my age and probably don't have access
to<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> 10<00:00:27.269> million<00:00:27.660> different<00:00:27.779> things<00:00:27.990> that

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to the 10 million different things that

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.950 
to the 10 million different things that
some<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.250> tutorials<00:00:29.699> use<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> thought

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
some of the tutorials use so I thought

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.290 
some of the tutorials use so I thought
I'd<00:00:31.199> show<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> how<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> did<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.460> using

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I'd show you how I did it kind of using

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'd show you how I did it kind of using
things<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.530> find<00:00:34.920> probably<00:00:35.460> in

things that you can find probably in

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819

your<00:00:35.850> room<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.210> probably<00:00:36.570> only<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.230> couple<00:00:37.440> of

your room is probably only a couple of
things<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> you'd<00:00:38.370> probably<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> go

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
black as opposed to new because when I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
with liquid latex you can use eyelash

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.170 
with liquid latex you can use eyelash
glue<00:01:11.100> though<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> don't<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.820> liquid

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
glue though if you don't have liquid

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
glue though if you don't have liquid
latex

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

this is from a Korean palette that I got

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.380 
this is from a Korean palette that I got
from<00:01:42.609> OCC

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
from OCC

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.819 
from OCC
I'm<00:01:43.869> just<00:01:44.109> applying<00:01:44.349> that<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:44.679> different

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
I'm just applying that to different

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.740 
I'm just applying that to different
areas<00:01:45.369> within<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.880> zipper<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.270> create<00:01:46.569> more

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
areas within the zipper to create more

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.839 
areas within the zipper to create more
depth<00:01:47.109> because<00:01:47.709> the<00:01:47.829> more<00:01:47.979> depth<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:48.490> have<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:48.849 
depth because the more depth we have the

00:01:48.849 --> 00:02:03.880 
depth because the more depth we have the
more<00:01:49.030> realistic<00:01:49.359> this<00:01:49.689> is<00:01:49.840> going<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.140> look

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.020 

taking<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> foundation<00:02:05.490> brush<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.850> now

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
taking a foundation brush I'm now

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
taking a foundation brush I'm now
blending<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.350> looks<00:02:07.380> like

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
blending it out so that it looks like

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
blending it out so that it looks like
it's<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.489> belongs<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> one<00:02:09.149> piece<00:02:09.390> because

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it's all belongs to one piece because

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's all belongs to one piece because
obviously<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> unzipped<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.039> face<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
obviously if you unzipped your face it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.670 
obviously if you unzipped your face it
wouldn't<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:12.000> blocked<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.510> color

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.339 

I'm<00:02:19.849> now<00:02:20.849> taking<00:02:21.390> bits<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.720> tissue<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.230> I'm

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
I'm now taking bits of tissue and I'm

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.690 
I'm now taking bits of tissue and I'm
just<00:02:22.620> sticking<00:02:22.800> them<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.099> using<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.550> liquid

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
just sticking them on using the liquid

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
just sticking them on using the liquid
latex<00:02:24.239> again<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.170> could<00:02:25.410> use<00:02:25.560> eyelash<00:02:26.040> glue

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
latex again you could use eyelash glue

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.710 
latex again you could use eyelash glue
for<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.519> if<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.760> don't<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.060> liquid<00:02:27.390> latex

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
for this if you don't have liquid latex

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.809 
for this if you don't have liquid latex
I'm<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.470> using<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.430> put

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
I'm just using this because when I put

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.790 
I'm just using this because when I put
the<00:02:30.000> color<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.720> won't<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.170> such<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> smooth

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the color on it won't have such a smooth

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.070 
the color on it won't have such a smooth
surface<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.640> obviously<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.630> unzipped

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
surface as obviously if you unzipped

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 
surface as obviously if you unzipped
your<00:02:34.170> face<00:02:34.440> there<00:02:34.739> will<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.890> different<00:02:35.519> depths

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
your face there will be different depths

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.390 
your face there will be different depths
within<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.799> before<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
within that you can do this before you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.710 
within that you can do this before you
apply<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> red<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> wanted<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.450> get<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
apply the red but I wanted to get the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.180 
apply the red but I wanted to get the
base<00:02:39.870> color<00:02:40.170> down<00:02:40.350> first<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:40.950> there

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
base color down first so that there

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.660 
base color down first so that there
weren't<00:02:41.340> any<00:02:41.519> white<00:02:42.000> mixing<00:02:42.480> kind<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.049> patches

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.520 

I'm<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:47.970> taking<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.420> pan<00:02:48.630> concealer<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.380> this

applying that on the fabric of the
zipper<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.940> blends<00:02:54.209> seamlessly<00:02:54.540> into

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
zipper so that it blends seamlessly into

you wish but I found that heavy duty
concealer<00:03:01.650> works<00:03:01.769> fine<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.430> they<00:03:02.819> go<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.150> with

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
concealer works fine and they go in with

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.120 
concealer works fine and they go in with
foundation<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.170> match<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> rest<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.980> my

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.470 
foundation to match up the rest of my
skin<00:03:07.070> I'm<00:03:08.070> taking<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.640> dark<00:03:08.940> red<00:03:09.150> cream

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
skin I'm taking that dark red cream

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.780 
skin I'm taking that dark red cream
color<00:03:09.780> again<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.170> apply<00:03:10.410> over<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.769> tissue<00:03:11.040> so

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
color again to apply over the tissue so

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.640 
color again to apply over the tissue so
yet<00:03:11.970> again<00:03:12.180> create<00:03:12.600> more<00:03:12.870> depth<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
yet again create more depth as the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.319 
yet again create more depth as the
wounds<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.040> probably<00:03:14.459> be<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.640> darker<00:03:15.120> color

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
wounds would probably be a darker color

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.810 
wounds would probably be a darker color
because<00:03:15.660> they'd<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.989> dried<00:03:16.320> blood<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.040> then

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
because they'd be dried blood and then

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.340 
because they'd be dried blood and then
I'm<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.329> doing<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.720> all<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> lightness

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:32.180 
I'm just doing that on all the lightness
to<00:03:19.380> blend<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.859> tissue<00:03:20.070> in

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
debt there is the more realistic it's

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.310 
debt there is the more realistic it's
gonna<00:03:42.820> look<00:03:48.660> finally<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.840> finish<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.200> look

the<00:03:53.260> effect<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:53.950> still<00:03:54.220> quite<00:03:54.370> a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the effect that it is still quite a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.400 
the effect that it is still quite a
fresh<00:03:54.910> wound<00:03:55.300> because<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.840> think<00:03:56.020> that<00:03:56.140> looks<00:03:56.320> a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
fresh wound because I think that looks a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.200 
fresh wound because I think that looks a
bit<00:03:56.440> more<00:03:56.740> gory<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.610> I'm<00:03:57.670> just<00:03:57.790> propping<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
bit more gory so I'm just propping that

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.340 
bit more gory so I'm just propping that
on<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.390> base<00:03:58.540> with<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.780> tissue<00:03:58.990> underneath

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
on the base with the tissue underneath

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.810 
on the base with the tissue underneath
to<00:03:59.680> make<00:03:59.830> sure<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.040> doesn't<00:04:00.190> go<00:04:00.400> all<00:04:00.550> over<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
to make sure it doesn't go all over the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.520 
to make sure it doesn't go all over the
carpet<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.050> this<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.290> the
