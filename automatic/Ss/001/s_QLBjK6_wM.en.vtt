apply a layer mask if you click on it
now<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> use<00:00:15.570> your<00:00:15.809> brush<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the layer white will reveal it this is a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.130 
the layer white will reveal it this is a
non-destructive<00:00:23.609> way<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.300> editing<00:00:24.779> images

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
non-destructive way of editing images

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.679 
non-destructive way of editing images
that's<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.560> did<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.039> car<00:00:26.279> here<00:00:26.689> in

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that's what I did with this car here in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.410 
that's what I did with this car here in
the<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:28.170> Photoshop<00:00:28.740> layer<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.269> see

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the other Photoshop layer as you can see

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.110 
the other Photoshop layer as you can see
black<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.160> everything<00:00:32.850> that's<00:00:32.940> been

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
black here is everything that's been

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.660 
black here is everything that's been
cropped<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> white<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.670> everything

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
cropped out and the white is everything

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.380 
cropped out and the white is everything
that<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.910> revealed

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that was revealed

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.709 
that was revealed
I've<00:00:36.800> actually<00:00:37.800> deleted<00:00:38.280> makar<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I've actually deleted makar there it is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.900 
I've actually deleted makar there it is
again

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
again

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.819 
again
so<00:00:41.910> now<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.360> were<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.739> disable<00:00:43.739> layer<00:00:43.890> mask

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
so now if I were to disable layer mask

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.930 
so now if I were to disable layer mask
you'll<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> white

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you'll see that it was just a white

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
you'll see that it was just a white
background<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> I'll<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.129> ahead<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.579> over

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
background so I'll go ahead and go over

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to duplicate layer and move this one

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.480 
to duplicate layer and move this one
over<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.200> other<00:01:19.380> side<00:01:22.700> okay<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:25.490> for

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
these three I'm just going to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.719

oops<00:01:29.340> change<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> color

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
oops change the color

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.880 
oops change the color
from<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.189> say<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.219> dark<00:01:35.670> gray

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.890 

same<00:01:40.550> thing<00:01:40.760> here

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.260 

and<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.710> last<00:01:45.920> one<00:01:46.160> and<00:01:46.580> what<00:01:46.730> this<00:01:46.850> does<00:01:47.060> is

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and the last one and what this does is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.600 
and the last one and what this does is
it<00:01:47.390> gives<00:01:47.480> a<00:01:47.630> little<00:01:47.840> bit<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.610> difference

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
it gives a little bit of difference

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.340 
it gives a little bit of difference
between<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.150> cut<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.510> text<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.110> lines

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
between the cut the text and the lines

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.400 
between the cut the text and the lines
it<00:01:51.950> adds<00:01:52.160> some<00:01:52.400> depth<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.960> think<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.290> looks

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
it adds some depth and I think it looks

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.930 
it adds some depth and I think it looks
pretty<00:01:54.680> good<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:56.740> mean<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.950> final<00:01:58.340> thing<00:01:58.580> is

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
pretty good I mean the final thing is

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:08.680 
pretty good I mean the final thing is
adding<00:01:59.690> our<00:02:00.130> footer

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.740 

add<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.230> new<00:02:09.500> layer<00:02:09.730> and<00:02:10.730> we'll<00:02:11.210> grab<00:02:11.450> our

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
add a new layer and we'll grab our

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.370 
add a new layer and we'll grab our
marquee<00:02:12.170> tool<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:13.270> drag<00:02:14.270> out<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.960> nice

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
marquee tool and drag out a nice

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.520 
marquee tool and drag out a nice
gradient<00:02:19.270> set<00:02:20.270> our<00:02:20.390> colors

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.480 

I'm<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.800> try<00:02:25.920> something

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.020 

now<00:02:30.150> don't<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.660> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.570 

yeah<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.180> looks<00:02:36.330> pretty<00:02:36.390> good<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.590> like

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
yeah that looks pretty good I like

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.450 
yeah that looks pretty good I like
gradients<00:02:39.030> they<00:02:39.150> add<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> lot<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.750> an<00:02:40.500> actual

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
gradients they add a lot to an actual

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.750 
gradients they add a lot to an actual
layout<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.290> they<00:02:43.470> add<00:02:43.650> depth<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.460> get<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
layout and they add depth you can get a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.900 
layout and they add depth you can get a

and I'm just going to duplicate this

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.250 
and I'm just going to duplicate this
because<00:04:02.910> I'm<00:04:03.000> going<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.150> put<00:04:03.210> this<00:04:03.420> up<00:04:03.600> in<00:04:03.750> my

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
because I'm going to put this up in my

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.840 
because I'm going to put this up in my
header<00:04:04.800> as<00:04:05.100> well<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.920> I'll<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.160> drag<00:04:08.610> this

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
header as well so I'll just drag this

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.940 
header as well so I'll just drag this
layer<00:04:09.090> down<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.600> my<00:04:09.810> header<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.380> you'll<00:04:10.680> see

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
layer down to my header and you'll see

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.530 
layer down to my header and you'll see
it<00:04:11.190> doesn't<00:04:11.370> show<00:04:11.640> up<00:04:11.850> but<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:12.150> because

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
it doesn't show up but that's because

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.030 
it doesn't show up but that's because
whenever<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.960> drag<00:04:13.170> something<00:04:13.380> into<00:04:13.740> a<00:04:13.770> group

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
whenever you drag something into a group

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.490 
whenever you drag something into a group
it<00:04:14.220> puts<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.520> at<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.700> bottom<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.990> just<00:04:16.200> drag<00:04:16.320> it

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
it puts it at the bottom so just drag it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.410 
it puts it at the bottom so just drag it
up<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> top<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:19.709> course<00:04:19.980> it's<00:04:20.310> not<00:04:20.549> up

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
up to the top and of course it's not up

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.030 
up to the top and of course it's not up
here<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.200> it's<00:04:22.320> not<00:04:22.410> going<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.650> appear

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040
