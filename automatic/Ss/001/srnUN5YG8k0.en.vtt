in you're moving the round like this a
little<00:03:51.459> bit<00:03:51.700> round<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.030> corner<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.990> just

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
little bit round the corner and you just

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.020 
little bit round the corner and you just
don't<00:03:53.470> really<00:03:53.740> you're<00:03:54.490> not<00:03:54.610> really<00:03:54.760> able<00:03:54.880> to

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
on your mouse is just really nice to be

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.540 
on your mouse is just really nice to be
able<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.570> crunch<00:04:01.840> down<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.130> can't<00:04:03.370> give

able to crunch down and it can't give

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.160 
able to crunch down and it can't give
you<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.760> advantage<00:04:04.240> can<00:04:04.930> make<00:04:05.080> the

you the advantage can make the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.540 
you the advantage can make the
difference<00:04:05.500> between<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.920> killing<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> other

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
difference between you killing the other

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.210 
difference between you killing the other
guy<00:04:06.670> rather<00:04:07.000> than<00:04:07.120> him<00:04:07.330> killing<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:08.010> as<00:04:09.010> for

guy rather than him killing you as for

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.800 
guy rather than him killing you as for
the<00:04:09.280> prone<00:04:09.550> one<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.970> don't<00:04:10.270> really<00:04:10.570> use<00:04:10.780> that

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
the prone one I don't really use that

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.620 
the prone one I don't really use that
too<00:04:11.140> much<00:04:11.350> it's<00:04:12.160> not<00:04:12.610> quite<00:04:13.090> as<00:04:13.180> effective<00:04:13.330> as

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
too much it's not quite as effective as

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.360 
too much it's not quite as effective as

toggle crouching I mean total crunch you

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.520 
toggle crouching I mean total crunch you
can<00:04:15.489> always<00:04:15.700> go<00:04:15.820> crotch<00:04:16.090> come<00:04:16.930> on<00:04:17.049> crunch<00:04:17.320> run

can always go crotch come on crunch run
around<00:04:17.620> crouch<00:04:18.070> crunch<00:04:18.940> or<00:04:19.570> prone<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.590> takes<00:04:20.950> a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
around crouch crunch or prone it takes a

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.800 
around crouch crunch or prone it takes a
little<00:04:21.220> while<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.790> get<00:04:21.910> up<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.419> little

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
little while to get up and a little

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.450 
little while to get up and a little
while<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.169> go<00:04:23.320> down<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.830> it's<00:04:24.010> not<00:04:24.160> really<00:04:24.400> the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
while to go down so it's not really the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
while to go down so it's not really the
most<00:04:24.640> useful<00:04:24.850> thing<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.419> firefight

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
most useful thing in firefight

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.700 
most useful thing in firefight
I<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.780> have<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:26.990> there<00:04:27.050> anyway<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.470> know

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
I just have it there anyway you know

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.650 
I just have it there anyway you know
maybe<00:04:28.280> if<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.520> come<00:04:28.669> on<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.850> sniper<00:04:29.150> fire<00:04:29.419> I'm

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
maybe if I come on the sniper fire I'm

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.030 
maybe if I come on the sniper fire I'm
just<00:04:29.870> running<00:04:30.139> around<00:04:30.230> here<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.770> want<00:04:30.980> to

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
just running around here and I want to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.820 
just running around here and I want to
throw<00:04:31.639> myself<00:04:31.790> on<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.060> ground<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:34.040> works<00:04:35.830> okay

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
throw myself on the ground it works okay

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.770 
throw myself on the ground it works okay
so<00:04:36.860> every<00:04:37.220> look<00:04:37.400> about<00:04:37.699> sensitivity<00:04:38.300> here

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
so every look about sensitivity here

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.960 
so every look about sensitivity here
that's<00:04:39.680> what<00:04:39.860> my<00:04:39.979> mouse<00:04:40.190> sensitivity<00:04:40.520> looks

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
that's what my mouse sensitivity looks

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.090 
that's what my mouse sensitivity looks
like<00:04:41.180> one<00:04:41.840> thing<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.199> definitely<00:04:42.260> learned<00:04:42.889> for

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
like one thing I definitely learned for

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.740 
like one thing I definitely learned for
battlefield<00:04:43.580> 3<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.449> lower

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
battlefield 3 is that a lower

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.439 
battlefield 3 is that a lower
sensitivity<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:46.460> definitely<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.150> way<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.300> go

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
sensitivity is definitely the way to go

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.870 
sensitivity is definitely the way to go
I<00:04:47.870> came<00:04:48.380> from<00:04:48.620> back<00:04:48.889> home<00:04:49.040> playing<00:04:49.310> Starcraft

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
I came from back home playing Starcraft

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.159 
I came from back home playing Starcraft
2<00:04:50.320> um<00:04:51.580> other<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.850> know<00:04:52.970> UI<00:04:53.210> control<00:04:53.810> games

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
2 um other you know UI control games

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.689 
2 um other you know UI control games
like<00:04:54.470> World<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.800> Warcraft<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.400> stuff<00:04:55.550> like

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
like World of Warcraft and stuff like

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:56.020 
like World of Warcraft and stuff like
that

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
that

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.580 
that
and<00:04:56.360> there<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.630> had<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.900> very<00:04:57.050> high<00:04:57.320> sensitivity

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
and there I had a very high sensitivity

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.590 
and there I had a very high sensitivity
and<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.280> came<00:04:58.490> into<00:04:58.610> battlefield<00:04:59.030> 3<00:04:59.360> with<00:04:59.570> the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
and I came into battlefield 3 with the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.200 
and I came into battlefield 3 with the
high<00:04:59.780> sensitivity<00:05:00.610> changed<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.729> down<00:05:01.880> much

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
high sensitivity changed it down much

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.010 
high sensitivity changed it down much
lower<00:05:02.540> and<00:05:02.870> I've<00:05:03.590> had<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.950> lot<00:05:04.310> more<00:05:04.550> results

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
lower and I've had a lot more results

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.110 
lower and I've had a lot more results
now<00:05:06.020> my<00:05:06.200> mouse<00:05:06.410> has<00:05:06.710> several<00:05:07.370> different<00:05:07.550> dpi

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
now my mouse has several different dpi

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.240 
now my mouse has several different dpi
settings<00:05:08.600> which<00:05:08.990> controls<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.620> sensitivity

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
settings which controls the sensitivity

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.870 
settings which controls the sensitivity
of<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.790> mouse<00:05:11.830> personally<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:12.889> use<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.520> setting

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
of a mouse personally I use a setting

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.600 
of a mouse personally I use a setting
which<00:05:14.030> is<00:05:14.330> equal<00:05:14.600> to<00:05:14.780> 1600<00:05:15.590> dpi<00:05:18.010> so<00:05:19.010> again<00:05:19.430> it's

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
which is equal to 1600 dpi so again it's

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.340 
which is equal to 1600 dpi so again it's
gonna<00:05:19.820> be<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.450> know<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:20.660> gonna<00:05:20.780> depend<00:05:20.930> upon

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
gonna be you know it's gonna depend upon

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.260 
gonna be you know it's gonna depend upon
your<00:05:21.530> mouse<00:05:21.830> whether<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.669> have<00:05:22.820> these<00:05:22.940> DPI

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
your mouse whether you have these DPI

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.790 
your mouse whether you have these DPI
settings<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.810> mean<00:05:23.990> I<00:05:24.020> realize<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.410> lot<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.710> you

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
settings I mean I realize a lot of you

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.920 
settings I mean I realize a lot of you
just<00:05:24.830> maybe<00:05:25.310> kind<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.580> using<00:05:25.880> some<00:05:26.060> Logitech

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
just maybe kind of using some Logitech

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.820 
just maybe kind of using some Logitech
mouse<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:27.350> doesn't<00:05:27.590> have<00:05:27.710> any

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
mouse and it doesn't have any

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.800 
mouse and it doesn't have any
sensitivity<00:05:28.520> settings<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:29.330> doesn't<00:05:29.570> have<00:05:29.690> any

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
sensitivity settings it doesn't have any

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.469 
sensitivity settings it doesn't have any
side<00:05:30.050> buttons<00:05:30.410> or<00:05:30.590> whatever<00:05:31.090> but<00:05:32.090> if<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.300> can

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
side buttons or whatever but if you can

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.170 
side buttons or whatever but if you can
get<00:05:32.780> hold<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.169> a<00:05:33.260> mouse<00:05:33.440> um<00:05:33.910> you<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.030> maybe

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
get hold of a mouse um you know maybe

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.640 
get hold of a mouse um you know maybe
next<00:05:35.450> time<00:05:35.630> you're<00:05:35.750> almost<00:05:35.840> breaks<00:05:36.350> then

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
next time you're almost breaks then

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.170 
next time you're almost breaks then
definitely<00:05:36.860> try<00:05:37.220> to<00:05:37.280> get<00:05:37.370> hold<00:05:37.550> on<00:05:37.700> with<00:05:37.850> dpi

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
definitely try to get hold on with dpi

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.510 
definitely try to get hold on with dpi
settings<00:05:38.600> because<00:05:38.780> it's<00:05:38.930> great<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:40.220> third

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
settings because it's great the third

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.490 
settings because it's great the third
thing<00:05:40.789> is<00:05:40.850> that<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.419> disable<00:05:41.960> all<00:05:42.169> Mouse

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
thing is that I disable all Mouse

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.860 
thing is that I disable all Mouse
acceleration<00:05:42.680> within<00:05:43.639> Windows<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.330> there<00:05:44.780> is

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
acceleration within Windows and there is

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.260 
acceleration within Windows and there is
a<00:05:44.900> fix<00:05:45.260> for<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:45.979> I'll<00:05:46.700> put<00:05:46.940> it<00:05:47.030> on<00:05:47.120> the

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
a fix for that and I'll put it on the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.240 
a fix for that and I'll put it on the
comments<00:05:47.630> or<00:05:47.810> not<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.380> comments<00:05:48.740> rather<00:05:49.010> the

video description below so that you guys

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.750 
video description below so that you guys
can<00:05:51.590> check<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:51.950> out<00:05:52.010> it's<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.520> pretty

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
can check that out it's a pretty

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.370 
can check that out it's a pretty
straightforward<00:05:53.060> tutorial<00:05:53.810> is<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:54.229> know

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
straightforward tutorial is you know

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.900 
straightforward tutorial is you know
need<00:05:54.560> sixty<00:05:54.830> two<00:05:54.979> minutes<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.400> do<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.789> it

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
need sixty two minutes to do and it

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.300 
need sixty two minutes to do and it
makes<00:05:56.060> quite<00:05:56.180> a<00:05:56.270> difference<00:05:56.919> my<00:05:57.919> vehicle

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
makes quite a difference my vehicle

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.060 
makes quite a difference my vehicle
sensitivity<00:05:58.880> is<00:05:59.169> it's<00:06:00.169> just<00:06:00.260> slightly<00:06:00.650> higher

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
sensitivity is it's just slightly higher

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.000 
sensitivity is it's just slightly higher
almost<00:06:01.479> double<00:06:02.479> my<00:06:02.840> mouse<00:06:03.080> sensitivity<00:06:03.440> and

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
almost double my mouse sensitivity and

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.770 
almost double my mouse sensitivity and
that's<00:06:04.400> really<00:06:04.610> just<00:06:04.729> so<00:06:04.970> I<00:06:05.000> can<00:06:05.210> swing<00:06:05.539> the

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
that's really just so I can swing the

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.700 
that's really just so I can swing the
turrets<00:06:06.289> around<00:06:06.470> in<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.889> tanks<00:06:07.250> much<00:06:07.430> better

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
turrets around in the tanks much better

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.339 
turrets around in the tanks much better
one<00:06:09.710> or<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.070> keybinding<00:06:10.840> which<00:06:11.840> maybe<00:06:12.139> isn't

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
one or the keybinding which maybe isn't

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.339 
one or the keybinding which maybe isn't
the<00:06:12.560> most<00:06:13.450> technical<00:06:14.450> keybinding<00:06:15.020> but<00:06:15.229> it

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
the most technical keybinding but it

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.680 
the most technical keybinding but it
makes<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.530> big<00:06:15.650> difference<00:06:15.680> is<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:17.030> E<00:06:17.419> is

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
makes a big difference is that E is

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.779 
makes a big difference is that E is
always<00:06:18.349> enter<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.770> exit<00:06:18.979> vehicle<00:06:19.190> and<00:06:19.520> I'm

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
always enter and exit vehicle and I'm

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.159 
always enter and exit vehicle and I'm
sure<00:06:20.000> this<00:06:20.120> is<00:06:20.180> probably<00:06:20.300> hopping<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:20.960> most

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
sure this is probably hopping the most

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.810 
sure this is probably hopping the most
it<00:06:21.349> was<00:06:21.440> where<00:06:21.650> you're<00:06:21.800> in<00:06:21.889> a<00:06:21.919> heli<00:06:22.130> or<00:06:22.669> you're

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
it was where you're in a heli or you're

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.279 
it was where you're in a heli or you're
in<00:06:22.910> a<00:06:22.940> jet<00:06:23.180> or<00:06:23.300> something<00:06:23.330> and<00:06:23.840> you<00:06:23.930> get<00:06:24.229> a

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
in a jet or something and you get a

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.510 
in a jet or something and you get a
little<00:06:24.410> bit<00:06:24.590> excited<00:06:25.070> you<00:06:25.190> know<00:06:25.340> your

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
little bit excited you know your

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.850 
little bit excited you know your
Adrenaline's<00:06:26.030> pumping<00:06:26.539> you're<00:06:27.500> shooting

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
Adrenaline's pumping you're shooting

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.570 
Adrenaline's pumping you're shooting
that<00:06:27.889> stuff<00:06:28.250> and<00:06:28.610> then<00:06:29.210> up<00:06:29.500> you<00:06:30.500> hit<00:06:30.740> II<00:06:31.070> by

that stuff and then up you hit II by

bailed out on my jet or whatever so I

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.300 
bailed out on my jet or whatever so I
change<00:06:40.039> a

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
change a

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.750

vehicle in the helicopters and jets to

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.420 
vehicle in the helicopters and jets to
be<00:06:44.030> so<00:06:44.750> I<00:06:44.780> can<00:06:44.990> enter<00:06:45.380> with<00:06:45.500> a<00:06:45.710> no<00:06:45.890> problem<00:06:46.310> but

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
be so I can enter with a no problem but

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.040 
be so I can enter with a no problem but
I<00:06:46.460> change<00:06:46.760> it<00:06:46.880> to<00:06:47.000> be<00:06:47.180> because<00:06:47.450> this<00:06:47.750> is<00:06:47.870> so

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
I change it to be because this is so

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.140 
I change it to be because this is so
annoying<00:06:48.350> when<00:06:48.590> you<00:06:48.710> accidentally<00:06:49.400> when<00:06:50.000> your
