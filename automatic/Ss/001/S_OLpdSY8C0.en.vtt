phone is the battery life so I decided

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.370 
phone is the battery life so I decided
to<00:00:08.700> put<00:00:08.849> together<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.179> sort<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.540> XDA<00:00:09.960> battery

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
to put together a sort of XDA battery

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.179 
to put together a sort of XDA battery

so the mods and apps I'm gonna be

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.390 
so the mods and apps I'm gonna be
featuring<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.500> video<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.220> might

already be aware of but I'm hoping that
you're<00:00:25.859> either<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> find<00:00:26.609> something

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
you're either going to find something

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
you're either going to find something
new<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.720> you're<00:00:27.900> modding<00:00:28.260> vet<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.890> will

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099

at<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.340> least<00:00:29.760> hopefully<00:00:30.179> act<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> bit

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
at the very least hopefully act as a bit

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
at the very least hopefully act as a bit
of<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> refresher<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> something

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
of a refresher so first up is something

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
of a refresher so first up is something
I've<00:00:33.690> done<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.079> devices<00:00:34.380> since<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> days

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I've done with my devices since the days

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.060 
I've done with my devices since the days
of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> HTC<00:00:35.910> Hero<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.540> Motorola<00:00:37.079> Atrix<00:00:37.260> which

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
of the HTC Hero and Motorola Atrix which

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
of the HTC Hero and Motorola Atrix which
is<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.489> only<00:00:38.700> underclock<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> CPU<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:39.989> also

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
is not only underclock the CPU but also

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
is not only underclock the CPU but also
set<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.160> screen<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.670> profile<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> do

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
set up a screen off profile so to do

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.319 
set up a screen off profile so to do
this<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> generally<00:00:44.340> use<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> two

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
this and generally use one of two

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.479 
this and generally use one of two
methods<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.440> find<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> download<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
methods basically I find and download a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.600 
methods basically I find and download a
well<00:00:47.820> made<00:00:48.059> CPU<00:00:48.719> control<00:00:49.110> app<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> used

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
well made CPU control app the one I used

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.060 
well made CPU control app the one I used
to<00:00:50.850> use<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.329> set<00:00:51.690> CPU<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> hasn't<00:00:53.010> been

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to use is set CPU but it hasn't been

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.010 
to use is set CPU but it hasn't been
updated<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> while<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.090> I'd<00:00:54.300> recommend<00:00:54.449> one

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
updated for a while so I'd recommend one

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.459 
updated for a while so I'd recommend one
of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.500> other<00:00:55.770> many<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:57.120> made<00:00:57.390> CPU<00:00:58.109> control

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
of the other many well made CPU control

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
of the other many well made CPU control

the comments below and let us know but

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.179 
the comments below and let us know but
the<00:01:06.540> method<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.960> generally<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.380> nowadays<00:01:07.710> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the method I generally use nowadays is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
the method I generally use nowadays is
downloading<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.000> flashing<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.540> custom<00:01:09.930> kernel

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
downloading and flashing a custom kernel

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
downloading and flashing a custom kernel
which<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.430> never<00:01:11.760> seems<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> shortage

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810

simple<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.689> use<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.500> tweaks

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
simple I just use it for little tweaks

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
simple I just use it for little tweaks
here<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.670> most<00:01:24.000> importantly<00:01:24.540> for

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
CPU to spike when I'm doing mundane

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.460 
CPU to spike when I'm doing mundane
tasks<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.700> texting<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.509> composing<00:01:43.140> emails

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
tasks like texting and composing emails

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.190 
tasks like texting and composing emails
and<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.610> end<00:01:44.729> result<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> CPU<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and so on the end result is a CPU that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810 
and so on the end result is a CPU that
doesn't<00:01:46.560> burn<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.979> battery<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.549> apps

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
doesn't burn through battery when apps

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
doesn't burn through battery when apps
are<00:01:48.000> updating<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.600> syncing<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
background while in my pocket and better

power consumption while doing light

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710 
power consumption while doing light
tasks<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.600> more

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
tasks and if you're a little more

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.630 
tasks and if you're a little more
experienced<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.860> interested<00:01:56.159> in

learning<00:01:56.729> about<00:01:56.939> under<00:01:57.420> bolting<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> can

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
learning about under bolting you can

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
learning about under bolting you can
achieve<00:01:58.200> even<00:01:58.619> better<00:01:58.799> power<00:01:59.579> consumption

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
achieve even better power consumption

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.819 
achieve even better power consumption
but<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> purpose<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.320> video<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
but for the purpose of this video I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.800 
but for the purpose of this video I
wanted<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> keep<00:02:02.579> things<00:02:02.790> simple<00:02:03.060> next<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
wanted to keep things simple next up is

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.840 
wanted to keep things simple next up is
an<00:02:03.960> app<00:02:04.079> called<00:02:04.110> Lam<00:02:04.770> ah<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:05.579> things

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
an app called Lam ah it does things

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
an app called Lam ah it does things
similar<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.360> other<00:02:06.540> apps<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.899> locale<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
similar to other apps like locale and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.650 
similar to other apps like locale and
Tasker<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.369> nearly<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.910> powerful<00:02:09.539> as

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
Tasker it's not nearly as powerful as

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.530 
Tasker it's not nearly as powerful as
the<00:02:09.780> after<00:02:10.110> mentioned<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.250> free<00:02:11.610> simple

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the after mentioned but it's free simple

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.309 
the after mentioned but it's free simple
and<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.050> does

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and it does

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.289 
and it does
what<00:02:13.439> I<00:02:13.469> needed<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.980> anyway<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:14.969> llama

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
what I needed to anyway so I use llama

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.629 
what I needed to anyway so I use llama
to<00:02:15.599> auto<00:02:15.900> disable<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:16.620> enable<00:02:16.650> Wi-Fi<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:17.609> I

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
to auto disable and enable Wi-Fi when I

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.089 
to auto disable and enable Wi-Fi when I
leave<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.239> arrive<00:02:18.659> back<00:02:18.959> home<00:02:19.019> this<00:02:19.829> way<00:02:20.069> I

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
leave and arrive back home this way I

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.770 
leave and arrive back home this way I
don't<00:02:20.219> have<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.579> remember<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.939> turn<00:02:21.090> Wi-Fi<00:02:21.359> on

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
don't have to remember to turn Wi-Fi on

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.199 
don't have to remember to turn Wi-Fi on
or<00:02:21.810> off<00:02:22.230> when<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.680> leave<00:02:22.799> or<00:02:23.310> come<00:02:23.639> back<00:02:23.849> and

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
or off when I leave or come back and

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.940 
or off when I leave or come back and
it's<00:02:24.450> actually<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.139> easy<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.650> set<00:02:25.829> up<00:02:25.920> for

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
it's actually really easy to set up for

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's actually really easy to set up for
this<00:02:26.189> purpose<00:02:26.249> and<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:26.939> doesn't<00:02:27.239> use<00:02:27.389> GPS<00:02:27.959> or

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this purpose and it doesn't use GPS or

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
this purpose and it doesn't use GPS or
even<00:02:28.620> data<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.280> find<00:02:29.489> your<00:02:29.639> home<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.120> work

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
even data to find your home or work

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.020 
even data to find your home or work
locations<00:02:31.019> instead<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:32.069> uses<00:02:32.459> cell<00:02:32.730> tower

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
locations instead it uses cell tower

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.179 
locations instead it uses cell tower
triangulation<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:34.230> sounds<00:02:34.560> fancy<00:02:34.859> doesn't

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
triangulation that sounds fancy doesn't

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.830 
triangulation that sounds fancy doesn't
it<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> don't<00:02:36.299> have<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.569> worry<00:02:36.750> about

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it so you don't have to worry about

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360 
it so you don't have to worry about
using<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.500> app<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.859> save<00:02:38.040> your<00:02:38.189> battery

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
using this app to save your battery

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.909 
using this app to save your battery
while<00:02:39.060> at<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.389> same<00:02:39.419> time<00:02:39.739> wasting<00:02:40.739> battery

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
while at the same time wasting battery

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.399 
while at the same time wasting battery
so<00:02:41.459> next<00:02:41.609> up<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.969> greenify<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:42.959> sure<00:02:43.139> most

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
so next up is greenify and I'm sure most

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.890 
so next up is greenify and I'm sure most
of<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.829> have<00:02:44.040> heard<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.609> or<00:02:44.969> even<00:02:45.209> currently

of you have heard of or even currently
using<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.469> right<00:02:46.650> now<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.700> really

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
using it right now it's a really

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.699 
using it right now it's a really

performance<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.819> for<00:02:57.000> me<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> free<00:02:57.510> version

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
performance so for me the free version

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.720 
performance so for me the free version
is<00:02:57.959> enough<00:02:58.290> especially<00:02:58.769> when<00:02:59.189> combined<00:02:59.549> with

but<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.639> didn't<00:03:18.060> really<00:03:18.180> find<00:03:18.419> it<00:03:18.569> necessary

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.659

unwanted<00:04:53.400> notifications<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.420> on<00:04:54.600> but

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
unwanted notifications and so on but

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.450 
unwanted notifications and so on but
right<00:04:55.110> now<00:04:55.200> you're<00:04:55.380> probably<00:04:55.470> asking<00:04:55.920> but

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
right now you're probably asking but

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.160 
right now you're probably asking but
what<00:04:56.700> about<00:04:56.910> when<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.150> need<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.450> use<00:04:57.930> those

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
what about when you need to use those

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.470 
what about when you need to use those
apps<00:04:58.470> well<00:04:58.800> that's<00:04:59.430> what<00:04:59.610> greenify<00:04:59.910> is<00:05:00.090> for

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
apps well that's what greenify is for

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.600 
apps well that's what greenify is for
after<00:05:01.110> you're<00:05:01.260> done<00:05:01.470> using<00:05:01.950> whatever<00:05:02.100> app<00:05:02.400> it

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
after you're done using whatever app it

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.220 
after you're done using whatever app it
is<00:05:02.700> you're<00:05:02.850> using<00:05:02.880> as<00:05:03.630> long<00:05:03.900> as<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.110> don't

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
is you're using as long as you don't

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.950 
is you're using as long as you don't
have<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.710> set<00:05:04.920> in<00:05:04.980> greenify<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.730> not<00:05:06.330> hibernate

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
have it set in greenify to not hibernate

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.650 
have it set in greenify to not hibernate
the<00:05:07.110> app<00:05:07.230> greenify<00:05:08.160> will<00:05:08.580> put<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:09.060> app<00:05:09.270> back

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
the app greenify will put that app back

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.360 
the app greenify will put that app back
to<00:05:09.870> sleep<00:05:10.140> until<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.590> next<00:05:10.800> time<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.070> need<00:05:11.100> it

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
to sleep until the next time you need it

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.740 
to sleep until the next time you need it
see<00:05:11.700> how<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.790> all<00:05:12.000> kind<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.240> works<00:05:12.510> together

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
see how it all kind of works together

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.920 
see how it all kind of works together
neat<00:05:13.380> huh<00:05:13.710> anyways<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.790> last<00:05:15.030> module<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.720> have

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
neat huh anyways the last module I have

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.110 
neat huh anyways the last module I have
for<00:05:16.200> you<00:05:16.290> is<00:05:16.440> called<00:05:16.800> performance<00:05:17.460> profile

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
for you is called performance profile

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.450 
for you is called performance profile
now<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:18.900> app<00:05:19.080> controls<00:05:19.440> your<00:05:19.560> device's<00:05:20.040> CPU

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
now this app controls your device's CPU

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.430 
now this app controls your device's CPU
behavior<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.120> technically<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:22.080> could

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
behavior so technically you could

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.260 
behavior so technically you could
replace<00:05:22.770> whatever<00:05:23.130> CPU<00:05:23.640> control<00:05:23.970> app<00:05:24.090> you're

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
replace whatever CPU control app you're

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.600 
replace whatever CPU control app you're
using<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.870> use<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.500> instead<00:05:25.890> but<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.400> thing

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
using and use this instead but the thing

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.390 
using and use this instead but the thing
is<00:05:26.640> performance<00:05:27.540> profile<00:05:27.990> is<00:05:28.230> app<00:05:28.470> specific

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
is performance profile is app specific

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.670 
is performance profile is app specific
as<00:05:29.520> in<00:05:29.670> it's<00:05:30.000> meant<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:30.480> control<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.140> CPU

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
as in it's meant to control the CPU

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.550 
as in it's meant to control the CPU
behavior<00:05:32.190> on<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.400> per<00:05:32.820> app<00:05:33.090> basis<00:05:33.840> so<00:05:34.350> for

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
behavior on a per app basis so for

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440 
behavior on a per app basis so for
instance<00:05:34.890> you<00:05:35.100> obviously<00:05:35.640> don't<00:05:35.970> need<00:05:36.270> the

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
instance you obviously don't need the

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.900 
instance you obviously don't need the
CPU<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.260> spike<00:05:37.530> when<00:05:37.919> you're<00:05:38.250> texting<00:05:38.730> or

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
CPU to spike when you're texting or

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.060 
CPU to spike when you're texting or
reading<00:05:39.240> an<00:05:39.330> email<00:05:39.660> but<00:05:40.320> maybe<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.770> want<00:05:41.010> to

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
reading an email but maybe you want to

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.640 
reading an email but maybe you want to
sit<00:05:41.370> at<00:05:41.610> maximum<00:05:42.390> load<00:05:42.660> while<00:05:43.260> you're<00:05:43.440> in<00:05:43.560> a

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
sit at maximum load while you're in a

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.950 
sit at maximum load while you're in a
long<00:05:43.950> gaming<00:05:44.310> session<00:05:44.880> there's<00:05:45.120> screen<00:05:45.810> off

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
long gaming session there's screen off

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.530 
long gaming session there's screen off
profiles<00:05:46.560> min<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.340> Max<00:05:47.700> CPU<00:05:48.120> control

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
profiles min and Max CPU control

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.659 
profiles min and Max CPU control
governor<00:05:49.110> selection<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:49.740> even<00:05:50.010> GPU<00:05:50.460> control

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
governor selection and even GPU control

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.030 
governor selection and even GPU control
so<00:05:51.060> with<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:51.750> module<00:05:52.230> you're<00:05:52.350> really<00:05:52.650> truly

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
so with this module you're really truly

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.010 
so with this module you're really truly
taking<00:05:53.340> control<00:05:53.580> of<00:05:53.700> your<00:05:53.820> CPUs<00:05:54.360> behavior<00:05:54.840> on

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
taking control of your CPUs behavior on

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.620 
taking control of your CPUs behavior on
a<00:05:55.050> specific<00:05:55.470> per<00:05:56.460> app<00:05:56.669> basis<00:05:57.210> which<00:05:57.390> is<00:05:57.510> not

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
a specific per app basis which is not

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.360 
a specific per app basis which is not
only<00:05:57.780> cool<00:05:58.080> but<00:05:58.650> also<00:05:58.770> pretty<00:05:59.040> impressive

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
only cool but also pretty impressive

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.430 
only cool but also pretty impressive
