00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.339
 it actually closes when they see it they go to 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.990
 note that this is spectacular 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.910
 model because it gives the feeling that you have 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.770
 a sweater or anger so it's a 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.080
 monkey and wool and we are the fringe 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.500
 well to micaela and it's like I had 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.070
 under the shirt or the pollerita 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.070
 remerita but it is not included yes 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.380
 three rooms that also breathe 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.750
 mentioned and a pollerita place 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:42.590
 above the shirt is not this is your 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:45.470
 included if there are two versions that 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.780
 it has micaela if I removed very linares 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.160
 we saw her she is a neighbor and the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.350
 that are going to see inside in the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.270
 mannequin that this is something very much at 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.040
 carvings the races you gave everything well 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.410
 devastated I had and I like it is one in 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.360
 gorina and grating and it is very very 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.310
 warm active kind of in something worthy I 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.070
 I will not do it on my mobile 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.520
 that is in america and is in angol and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.140
 neira to be dragged 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 crouched we are working for 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 teenagers 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 well, as they are, I hope there is 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.190
 All the proposal all included me 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.930
 it would seem that they have the remerit but not 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.100
 is everything or we are not going to see it is very 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.600
 easy to perform 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 I tell you that this is something very 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.590
 economic to do can get it in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.479
 gorina that is a rayadito material that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 you have the mannequin or what 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.150
 they saw in micaela and that is the mold of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.920
 wool is soft do not always fear to 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.720
 be t-shirt look for soft materials 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 because if they bite gentlemen something very very 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.800
 annoying let's start with the molds and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 let's start there is a tache 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.570
 kato if you see is something very small 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 this the mold if it is a base mold is a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.160
 mold of a children's shirt by 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.780
 course is 14 my face is 15 years old yes 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.810
 but because 14 because they have to be 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.489
 adjusted 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.440
 has many the two materials that you 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.120
 names that give so many then 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.709
 you can see we are going to start 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.330
 Girls are using it very shortly to 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.910
 the pulleys of di that is a rectangle of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.980
 55 centimeters long the line of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.720
 dots indicates double cloth and you see 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.940
 that I in a single mold have my back 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.220
 and the forward has a very dug 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.050
 small keep in mind this why 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.180
 because it 's a shirt we can not dig 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.010
 too much, it's not like an Alava neck like that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.200
 make it clear to you that later we have 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.000
 a very small appointment all measures 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.610
 are going to be left with the production you 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 you can ask for it remember your size 14 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.290
 this is back front now let's 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.790
 what is the rectangle for cholera 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.200
 you know that I always like 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.720
 work in which the rectangles 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.060
 that are shaped so that it is not something that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 adjustment but as it is children in this case 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.420
 we're not going to shape it, let's do 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.819
 just a rectangle like you 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.950
 can see if the dotted line indicates 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.900
 double cloth these base is easy let's 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.660
 sew by one of the long fingers what 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.569
 we turn and it's network type placement 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.370
 it's very easy to do and now that what 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 we would lack the sleeves and here is the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.969
 little secret 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.829
 come and I put it this way is 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.230
 a normal sleeve 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.420
 you will see it very long but as 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.730
 it's a shirt it's something a policy is 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.680
 something adjusted then of course to 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.019
 Boy shoulder and the sleeve is long 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.090
 then you are going to make the mold if 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.819
 of a normal sleeve the two centimeters 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.260
 so have the baby will make 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.659
 be the normal sleeve with the measure 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.400
 normal dotted line indicate fabric 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.590
 double but what will be the change that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.329
 we are going to give him I decided that I have a 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.340
 opening that is what even opens 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.500
 It was so cute, eight centimeters 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.189
 then of course to this length of 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.560
 sleeve 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.510
 we have to add eight centimeters more 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.639
 one that is going to be the one that we are going to give 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.430
 for the crossing to be able to hold 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.430
 then what they see in pink would be the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.409
 cut in cotton and this would be if 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.079
 who see all green would be the pieces 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.969
 of the furniture or henÃ¡n gorina now go to 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.730
 give it when we started working 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.819
 it will be easy for you not to be scared 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.439
 and let's start with work 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.260
 this is the rectangle that I said 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.939
 that we have to cut without it and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.039
 run we will work as a network for 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.109
 the neck shirt then you are going to 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.060
 double the width half will know 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.729
 for the length and then we're going to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.830
 turn facing the times and already 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.419
 let's have the neck to place it 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.270
 this shorter you of course 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.949
 they are going to give the stop that more they like a 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.710
 time they have this rectangle like this 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.539
 worked riff guy then yes i already 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.970
 I was advancing the steps that we are going to 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.740
 be going to join front back by 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.419
 the shoulders facing the rights of 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 the fabrics and how I always tell them 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.430
 although I'm going to repeat the cancer 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.590
 we always need to place the strip of 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.110
 reinforcement to which is 2 centimeters and 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.330
 you should always cut the thread and then 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.130
 let's sew the contour of the neckline 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.139
 something very very easy to do 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.690
 the rectangle that I just gave them 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.550
 show you see it is sewn without 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.620
 stretch absolutely nothing what that 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.969
 neckline and stretch much more 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.699
 and what that cleavage in front 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.529
 once we have this so we go to the 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.809
 I'm going to give it back, it's going to 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.029
 leave prepared in a corner for 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:17.470
 then give the whole presentation this 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.470
 T-shirt 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.900
 I leave once we have this so 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.820
 let's trotters sleeves I take 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.270
 I have you can give that is what 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.400
 I did let's go to your base pillar and opening and 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.950
 after very simple we are going to fold hoist 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.430
 just walk to machine all this all 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.410
 its row 2 or base and opening once 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.200
 that do all the hem I go to 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.960
 just put a pin there and we're going to 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.790
 know if the rectangle or the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.430
 little piece of sleeve what the cut of the 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.380
 manga that I polished you can 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.420
 choose a riff you can choose to use from 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.670
 Cotton is also very nice your 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.260
 pull on the top straight part and now 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.990
 is what I told them we are going to 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.820
 superimpose not only 8 that is the measure of 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.490
 the opening but one more centimeter 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.360
 up and there we are going to hold with a 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.100
 straight seam or a zig zag and remember 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.050
 they work with knit fabrics then 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.729
 they need the attention of the thread 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.249
 top is loose 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.979
 kosen like that and I'm going to show you how 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:21.189
 will be left once we have it 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.949
 so I show it to you from the back to see 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:27.430
 there is the subject with a straight seam 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.469
 only that this would be the reverse and 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.809
 we have what looks like we have 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:34.059
 a tool below and here I'm going to 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:37.120
 turn one can see like me to 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:39.279
 sink all this yes on foot machine by 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.400
 course you do not see anything at all 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:44.139
 because I did it with a high thread then 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.569
 once they have the sleeves ready 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.550
 so now we put the pollerite on 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.099
 we always assemble all the garments of 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.930
 point let's put the sleeves to the 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.649
 appointments facing the rights of 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.949
 fabrics 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:59.620
 we are going to close under sleeves and sides 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.990
 yes and finally what are we going to do 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.930
 to bend and already two centimeters what 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.389
 it's fists and base of grief just that 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.430
 it's easy I'm not going to put it into practice anymore 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.080
 same to buy the material look at these 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.180
 they are very economical are what 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.610
 we need to loan this t-shirt so 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.759
 only 600 centimeters of mold and wool 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.499
 and 30 centimeters of polito that tells me 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.749
 teach the proposal I know it's going 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:24.099
 to like to put it into practice and you 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:27.120
 they do not send me from there because we have 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:28.560
 much more here in points and stitches 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.780
 or also what we can do is 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.750
 recycle a shirt you saw that the 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.760
 teenagers grow up steps 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.120
 gigantic then good what good 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.120
 idea
