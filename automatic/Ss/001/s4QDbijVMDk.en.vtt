00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
first of all I have got this really cool
cushion<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.590> says<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.219> saleable<00:00:59.609> mum

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
cushion which says for a saleable mum

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470 
cushion which says for a saleable mum
and<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.809> kind<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.760> natural<00:01:02.760> neutral

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and it's that kind of natural neutral

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.440 
and it's that kind of natural neutral
and<00:01:03.660> most<00:01:03.809> sac<00:01:04.430> looking<00:01:05.430> material<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.270> don't

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and most sac looking material I don't

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.000 
and most sac looking material I don't
know<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> technical<00:01:07.049> term<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.890> then

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
know what the technical term is but then

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.890 
know what the technical term is but then
it's<00:01:08.159> black<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.540> think<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it's black on the back and I think it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's black on the back and I think it's
pretty<00:01:10.049> simple<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.340> cute<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
pretty simple but it's really cute and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
pretty simple but it's really cute and
this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.630> probably<00:01:13.110> would<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> nice

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this is probably would do as a nice

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.340 
this is probably would do as a nice
present<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> card<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.869> mum<00:01:16.020> Mouse<00:01:16.200> I've

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
present of a card if your mum Mouse I've

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560 
present of a card if your mum Mouse I've
been<00:01:16.470> arm<00:01:16.619> chair<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.909> her<00:01:18.119> spot

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
like a lot of mums do and I think that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.609 
like a lot of mums do and I think that

that<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.880> looks<00:04:13.090> like<00:04:13.270> it<00:04:13.390> should<00:04:13.420> be<00:04:13.690> made<00:04:13.840> out

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
that it looks like it should be made out

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.180 
that it looks like it should be made out
of<00:04:14.020> tin<00:04:14.350> because<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.650> get<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.830> lot<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.010> these

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
of tin because you get a lot of these

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.180 
of tin because you get a lot of these
tin<00:04:15.550> mugs<00:04:15.820> with<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.600> font<00:04:16.930> on<00:04:17.170> it<00:04:17.290> but<00:04:17.830> it's
