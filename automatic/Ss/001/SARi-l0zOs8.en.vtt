00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
was recovered out of the third jug those

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.690 
was recovered out of the third jug those
jugs<00:02:49.079> are<00:02:49.290> roughly<00:02:49.560> five<00:02:49.889> and<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.099> half<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.489> six

jugs are roughly five and a half to six
inches<00:02:51.090> thick<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.829> math

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
inches thick so you can do the math

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.289 
inches thick so you can do the math
yourself<00:02:53.480> that's<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.630> pretty<00:02:54.810> nice<00:02:55.019> expansion

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
yourself that's a pretty nice expansion

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.210 
yourself that's a pretty nice expansion
those<00:02:57.299> pedals<00:02:57.720> would<00:02:57.930> definitely<00:02:58.440> turn<00:02:58.680> nasty

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
those pedals would definitely turn nasty

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
hole this is coming in 0.72 to five at

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.990 
hole this is coming in 0.72 to five at
its<00:03:04.019> widest<00:03:04.470> point<00:03:04.500> over<00:03:05.160> roughly<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.760> size

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
its widest point over roughly the size

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.390 
its widest point over roughly the size

I'd say the Horned attack combined with

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.710 
I'd say the Horned attack combined with
the<00:03:10.349> XDS<00:03:10.859> would<00:03:11.400> definitely<00:03:11.910> get<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.450> job

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the XDS would definitely get the job
