suck<00:03:12.739> up<00:03:12.890> more<00:03:13.189> and<00:03:13.310> more<00:03:13.400> things<00:03:22.870> now<00:03:23.870> because

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
suck up more and more things now because

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.569 
suck up more and more things now because
a<00:03:24.200> lot<00:03:24.409> of<00:03:24.440> things<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.950> there<00:03:25.099> are<00:03:25.129> still

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
a lot of things in there are still

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.809 
a lot of things in there are still
pretty<00:03:25.909> hard<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.079> solid<00:03:27.459> because<00:03:28.459> heat<00:03:28.639> this

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
pretty hard and solid because heat this

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.699 
pretty hard and solid because heat this
baby<00:03:29.060> hasn't<00:03:29.450> been<00:03:29.540> feeding<00:03:29.870> for<00:03:30.019> 24<00:03:30.440> hours

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
baby hasn't been feeding for 24 hours

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.080 
baby hasn't been feeding for 24 hours
already<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:32.109> it's<00:03:33.109> crop<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.849> still<00:03:34.849> did

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
already and it's crop I still did

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.479 
already and it's crop I still did
swollen<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:42.530> has<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.829> be<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.099> done<00:03:43.310> I

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
swollen so this has to be but done I

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.369 
swollen so this has to be but done I
could<00:03:43.700> still<00:03:43.970> see<00:03:44.180> chunks<00:03:44.569> of<00:03:44.840> food<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.200> there

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
could still see chunks of food in there

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.229 
could still see chunks of food in there
so<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:45.709> definitely<00:03:45.799> pretty<00:03:46.519> dried<00:03:46.790> up<00:03:49.239> I've

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
so it's definitely pretty dried up I've

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.150 
so it's definitely pretty dried up I've
already<00:03:50.659> given<00:03:50.780> him<00:03:51.340> three<00:03:52.340> four<00:03:52.609> doses<00:03:52.879> of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
already given him three four doses of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.030 
already given him three four doses of
baking<00:03:55.160> powder<00:03:57.459> solutions<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.900> help<00:04:00.109> dilute

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
baking powder solutions to help dilute

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.599 
baking powder solutions to help dilute
it<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:02.540> guess<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.139> first<00:04:03.709> felt<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.430> this

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
it and guess when I first felt it this

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.149 
it and guess when I first felt it this
morning<00:04:05.030> it<00:04:06.019> was<00:04:06.169> still<00:04:06.440> pretty<00:04:06.620> hard<00:04:09.159> this

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
morning it was still pretty hard this

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.449 
morning it was still pretty hard this
crop<00:04:10.519> was<00:04:10.730> still<00:04:10.940> pretty<00:04:11.150> hard<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:15.310> there<00:04:16.310> we

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
crop was still pretty hard so there we

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.550 
crop was still pretty hard so there we
go

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
go

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.069 
go
that's<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.680> lot<00:04:18.859> right<00:04:19.099> there<00:04:19.599> it's<00:04:20.599> a<00:04:20.630> lot<00:04:20.780> more

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
that's a lot right there it's a lot more

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:32.589 
that's a lot right there it's a lot more

used to come out in droplets now that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.689 
used to come out in droplets now that
it's<00:05:07.270> actually<00:05:07.690> coming<00:05:07.870> out<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.979> let's<00:05:09.520> say

is pretty weird feeling it's like a

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.320 
is pretty weird feeling it's like a
gigantic<00:05:41.319> worm<00:05:41.740> that<00:05:42.009> goes<00:05:42.190> down<00:05:42.400> system<00:05:43.060> to

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
gigantic worm that goes down system to

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.790 
gigantic worm that goes down system to
them<00:05:43.509> right<00:05:43.659> now

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.360 

you'll<00:05:47.800> have<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.099> do<00:05:48.219> it<00:05:52.409> as<00:05:53.409> you<00:05:53.710> can<00:05:53.949> see<00:05:54.009> his

crop is getting smaller and smaller is
the<00:05:56.319> more<00:05:56.590> that<00:05:56.740> I'm<00:05:56.860> sucking<00:05:57.279> out<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:58.389> means

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
the more that I'm sucking out that means

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:17.909 
the more that I'm sucking out that means
it's<00:05:58.779> gonna<00:05:58.930> be<00:05:59.020> clear

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.499 

perfect<00:06:18.919> a<00:06:19.280> lot<00:06:19.759> more<00:06:20.030> coming<00:06:20.389> up

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
you see why I have to pull this out

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.399 
you see why I have to pull this out
every<00:06:25.009> single<00:06:25.159> time<00:06:25.900> because<00:06:26.900> it's<00:06:27.080> such<00:06:27.349> a

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
every single time because it's such a

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:29.920 
every single time because it's such a
high<00:06:27.650> amount<00:06:27.770> of<00:06:28.009> pressure<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.460> needed<00:06:28.879> to<00:06:29.659> suck

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
high amount of pressure I needed to suck

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.839 
high amount of pressure I needed to suck
through<00:06:30.169> from<00:06:30.379> that<00:06:30.409> tube<00:06:33.189> they<00:06:34.189> have<00:06:34.400> to<00:06:34.580> pump

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
through from that tube they have to pump

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.879 
through from that tube they have to pump
multiple<00:06:35.479> in<00:06:35.659> multiple<00:06:35.689> time<00:06:36.409> and<00:06:36.620> this<00:06:36.710> will

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
multiple in multiple time and this will

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.909 
multiple in multiple time and this will
take<00:06:37.099> ages<00:06:37.719> hours<00:06:38.719> if<00:06:38.990> it<00:06:39.110> has<00:06:39.259> to<00:06:39.500> although

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
take ages hours if it has to although

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.830 
take ages hours if it has to although
that<00:06:40.639> would<00:06:40.789> be<00:06:40.909> very<00:06:41.030> uncomfortable<00:06:41.659> for

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
that would be very uncomfortable for

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.899 
that would be very uncomfortable for
bathing<00:06:42.259> my<00:06:42.379> hands<00:06:42.590> are<00:06:42.770> all<00:06:42.889> red<00:06:43.129> from

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
bathing my hands are all red from

bathing my hands are all red from
pulling<00:06:44.240> on<00:06:44.360> this<00:06:44.509> syringe<00:06:48.310> I've<00:06:49.310> tried<00:06:49.610> to

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
pulling on this syringe I've tried to

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.309 
pulling on this syringe I've tried to
let<00:06:49.909> him<00:06:50.090> breath<00:06:50.270> but<00:06:50.689> it<00:06:50.870> hasn't<00:06:51.050> been
