first<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.470> all<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.710> is<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.860> memory<00:01:57.670> test<00:01:57.880> you'll

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
first of all it is a memory test you'll

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.390 
first of all it is a memory test you'll
see<00:01:58.510> that<00:01:58.630> come<00:01:58.810> up<00:01:58.930> on<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.380> top<00:02:00.070> left<00:02:00.310> hand

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
see that come up on the top left hand

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:14.640 
see that come up on the top left hand
side<00:02:00.610> of<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:00.970> screen

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.660 

well<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.489> detected<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.180> 12<00:02:16.870> megabytes<00:02:17.349> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
well just detected the 12 megabytes of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:47.360 
well just detected the 12 megabytes of
RAM<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:19.060> boot<00:02:19.599> up

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.539 

it's<00:02:47.879> actually<00:02:48.860> booting<00:02:49.860> two<00:02:50.040> docks<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
it's actually booting two docks at the

00:02:50.549 --> 00:03:18.140 
it's actually booting two docks at the
moment<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.620> wait<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.159> booted<00:02:54.090> us
