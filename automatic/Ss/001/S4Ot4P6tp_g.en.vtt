hello<00:00:01.260> YouTube<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.850> today<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.570> show<00:00:04.410> you

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
hello YouTube I'm here today to show you

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.600 
hello YouTube I'm here today to show you
this<00:00:04.710> piston<00:00:05.160> bridge<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:05.879> made<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.720> is

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
this piston bridge that I made that is

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.250 
this piston bridge that I made that is
six<00:00:08.610> blocks<00:00:08.880> wide<00:00:09.090> obviously<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.080> one

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
six blocks wide obviously not this one

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.789 
six blocks wide obviously not this one
this<00:00:10.349> one's<00:00:10.530> only<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.830> block<00:00:11.010> wide<00:00:11.219> um<00:00:12.740> but<00:00:13.740> I

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
this one's only one block wide um but I

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.279 
this one's only one block wide um but I
haven't<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.340> seen<00:00:14.719> anything<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
haven't really seen anything like the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.160 
haven't really seen anything like the
the<00:00:16.830> six<00:00:17.100> block<00:00:17.279> wide<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.820> I've<00:00:17.910> made<00:00:18.170> it

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the six block wide one that I've made it

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529 
the six block wide one that I've made it
I've<00:00:19.529> seen<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.949> few<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:20.640> five<00:00:21.029> four<00:00:21.480> or

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I've seen a few that are five four or

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
I've seen a few that are five four or
five<00:00:21.660> blocks<00:00:21.930> wide<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.949> pretty

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
five blocks wide that are pretty

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.200 
five blocks wide that are pretty
complicated<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:25.430> but<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.490> figured<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.090> way

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
complicated and but I figured out a way

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.620 
complicated and but I figured out a way
make<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:28.050> more<00:00:28.230> simple<00:00:28.619> than<00:00:29.539> what<00:00:30.539> I've

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
make it much more simple than what I've

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.520 
make it much more simple than what I've
seen<00:00:30.779> before<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.079> usually<00:00:34.200> don't<00:00:34.410> post

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
seen before and I usually don't post

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
seen before and I usually don't post
these<00:00:34.710> kinds<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> videos<00:00:35.040> because<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> don't

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
these kinds of videos because I don't

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
these kinds of videos because I don't
have<00:00:35.640> anything<00:00:35.790> interesting<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.329> show<00:00:36.989> you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
have anything interesting to show you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
have anything interesting to show you
but<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.370> interesting

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
but I think this is pretty interesting

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.450 
but I think this is pretty interesting
so<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> show<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.649> basics<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so I'm going to show you some basics and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.569 
so I'm going to show you some basics and
then<00:00:41.489> we'll<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> actual<00:00:42.780> bridge<00:00:43.579> all

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
then we'll get to the actual bridge all

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.990 
then we'll get to the actual bridge all
right<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.879> one's<00:00:45.140> one<00:00:46.140> block<00:00:46.410> wide<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
right so this one's one block wide and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.560 
right so this one's one block wide and
this<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.239> show<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> concept<00:00:49.489> the

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
this is just show you the concept the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
this is just show you the concept the
the<00:00:51.570> piston<00:00:52.230> or<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> torch<00:00:53.100> powers<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> piston

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the piston or the torch powers of piston

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.510 
the piston or the torch powers of piston
above<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.899> pushes<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> block<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.980> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
above it which pushes the block up so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
above it which pushes the block up so
you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.270> something<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.739> have

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you can do something like that you have

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.619 
you can do something like that you have
repeaters<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.359> ends<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.920> blocks

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
repeaters on the ends of all the blocks

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
repeaters on the ends of all the blocks
it's<00:01:03.629> pretty<00:01:03.780> simple<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it's pretty simple so if you can do it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.050 
it's pretty simple so if you can do it
with<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.869> block<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.530> two

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
with one block you can do it with two

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.560 
with one block you can do it with two
repeaters<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.299> each<00:01:09.450> side<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:11.570> that's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
repeaters on each side like that that's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.640 
repeaters on each side like that that's
also<00:01:12.720> pretty<00:01:13.470> simple<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.530> you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
also pretty simple and so but if you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.310 
also pretty simple and so but if you
want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.310> four<00:01:18.030> block<00:01:18.150> wide<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:19.110> gets

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
want to do a four block wide one it gets

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
want to do a four block wide one it gets
a<00:01:19.470> bit<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.920> complicated<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
a bit more complicated if you have to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
a bit more complicated if you have to
use<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> different<00:01:21.479> technique<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.380> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
use a different technique like this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.460 
use a different technique like this
torch<00:01:23.130> power<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.880> block<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.869> powers

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
torch power is this block which powers

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
torch power is this block which powers
the<00:01:25.500> piston<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.880> pushes<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the piston which pushes it all up and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.830 
the piston which pushes it all up and
then<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.460> using<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> make

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
then so you can using that you can make

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:40.700 
then so you can using that you can make
it<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.979> blocks<00:01:33.200> like<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:39.619> here<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it go up for blocks like so and here it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.330 
it go up for blocks like so and here it
is<00:01:40.829> my<00:01:41.460> 6th<00:01:42.270> block<00:01:42.360> wide<00:01:42.689> bridge<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.799> uses<00:01:44.009> sort

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is my 6th block wide bridge it uses sort

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.920 
is my 6th block wide bridge it uses sort
of<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> combination<00:01:44.670> between<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.450> two<00:01:45.600> like

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
of a combination between the two like

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
of a combination between the two like
this<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.860> part<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.729> sort<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
this this part right here is sort of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.830 
this this part right here is sort of
like<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.939> four<00:01:50.939> block<00:01:51.149> wide<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:52.710> there

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
like the four block wide one over there

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
like the four block wide one over there
it's<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.799> center

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's got the two and then this center

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's got the two and then this center
part<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> sort<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.719> plug<00:01:57.960> wide

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
part is sort of like the two plug wide

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.350 
part is sort of like the two plug wide
one<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> powers<00:01:58.770> use<00:01:59.759> blocks<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.270> which

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
one the powers use blocks at which

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.060 
one the powers use blocks at which
powers<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> pistons<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.880 

here's<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.580> field<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:08.090> lava<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.929> may<00:02:09.080> push<00:02:09.740> up

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
here's the field of lava you may push up

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.760 
here's the field of lava you may push up
the<00:02:09.920> bridge<00:02:10.480> and<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.570> have<00:02:11.690> nice<00:02:11.870> really<00:02:12.560> wide

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
the bridge and you have nice really wide

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.910 
the bridge and you have nice really wide
bridge<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.460> walk<00:02:13.610> across<00:02:14.500> really<00:02:15.500> useful<00:02:15.590> if

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
bridge to walk across really useful if

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.390 
bridge to walk across really useful if
you<00:02:16.010> want<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.280> build<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.790> huge<00:02:17.750> castle<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.800> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
you want to build a huge castle and you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.500 
you want to build a huge castle and you
need<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:20.050> suitably<00:02:21.050> huge<00:02:21.410> drawbridge<00:02:22.510> that's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
need a suitably huge drawbridge that's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500 
need a suitably huge drawbridge that's
what<00:02:23.630> I'm<00:02:23.720> going<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.959> using<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:25.510> your

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
what I'm going to be using it for your

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.060 
what I'm going to be using it for your
may<00:02:26.630> be<00:02:26.690> wondering<00:02:27.020> well<00:02:27.260> why<00:02:27.440> don't<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.770> make

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
may be wondering well why don't you make

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.520 
may be wondering well why don't you make
it<00:02:28.220> wider<00:02:28.459> well<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.140> if

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
it wider well you can see here that if

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.940 
it wider well you can see here that if
you<00:02:30.709> put<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.340> block<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.180> lava<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:33.050> each<00:02:33.350> side<00:02:33.620> it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
you put a block of lava on each side it

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.260 
you put a block of lava on each side it
will<00:02:34.100> flow<00:02:34.310> together<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:35.870> six<00:02:36.230> blocks<00:02:37.270> like

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
will flow together for six blocks like

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.420 
will flow together for six blocks like
that<00:02:38.480> if<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.200> its<00:02:39.320> first<00:02:39.530> step<00:02:39.800> if<00:02:40.340> you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that if you have its first step if you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.949 
that if you have its first step if you
have<00:02:40.550> seven<00:02:40.910> blocks<00:02:41.090> apart<00:02:41.300> then<00:02:41.720> there<00:02:41.900> will

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
have seven blocks apart then there will

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.600 
have seven blocks apart then there will
be<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.110> big<00:02:42.290> space<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.800> middle<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> think

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
be a big space in the middle so I think

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.460 
be a big space in the middle so I think
you<00:02:44.209> could<00:02:44.330> potentially<00:02:45.020> make<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.260> bridge

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
you could potentially make the bridge

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.260 
you could potentially make the bridge
wider<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:46.220> there's<00:02:46.610> really<00:02:46.730> no<00:02:46.910> need<00:02:46.940> to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
wider but there's really no need to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.870 
wider but there's really no need to
because<00:02:47.989> if<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.040> make<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.280> any<00:02:49.430> water<00:02:49.670> than

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
because if you make it any water than

00:02:49.880 --> 00:03:01.810 
because if you make it any water than
lava<00:02:50.030> won't<00:02:50.330> flow<00:02:50.480> together<00:02:59.110> and<00:03:00.550> now<00:03:01.550> i<00:03:01.610> guess

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
lava won't flow together and now i guess

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.229 
lava won't flow together and now i guess
i'll<00:03:01.970> show<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.180> how<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.600> make<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.989> oh<00:03:07.090> my<00:03:08.090> i'll

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
i'll show you how to make it oh my i'll

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.240 
i'll show you how to make it oh my i'll
make<00:03:08.390> one<00:03:08.540> section<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.350> then<00:03:09.470> because

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
make one section of it and then because

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.170 
make one section of it and then because
it's<00:03:10.400> basically<00:03:10.640> what<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:10.880> do<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.150> make

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it's basically what you do is you make

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.960 
it's basically what you do is you make
one<00:03:11.420> section<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.019> then<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.070> just<00:03:13.250> repeat<00:03:13.519> the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
one section and then you just repeat the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.479 
one section and then you just repeat the
same<00:03:14.269> thing<00:03:14.480> over<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.750> over<00:03:14.870> again<00:03:15.489> so

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
same thing over and over again so

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.210 
same thing over and over again so
basically<00:03:16.730> take<00:03:17.120> two<00:03:17.239> blocks<00:03:17.590> put<00:03:18.590> torches<00:03:18.950> on

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
basically take two blocks put torches on

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.750 
basically take two blocks put torches on
top<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.519> each<00:03:20.260> put<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> repeater<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.739> each<00:03:21.950> side

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.259 

like<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.890> put<00:03:27.890> redstone<00:03:28.370> behind<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
like that and put redstone behind to

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.470 
like that and put redstone behind to
that<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:32.269> take<00:03:32.480> another<00:03:32.720> two<00:03:33.170> blocks<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:34.670> each

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
that you take another two blocks on each

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.530 
that you take another two blocks on each
side<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:39.250> put<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> block<00:03:40.549> above<00:03:40.880> where<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
side and put a block above where the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.580 
side and put a block above where the
redstone<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.019> on<00:03:42.440> each<00:03:42.560> side<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.500> then<00:03:45.500> you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
redstone is on each side and then you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.370 
redstone is on each side and then you
can<00:03:45.739> put<00:03:45.920> torches<00:03:46.250> on<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.239> sides<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.900> that

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
can put torches on the sides of that

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:57.640 
can put torches on the sides of that
block<00:03:48.769> in<00:03:49.010> on<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> top<00:03:51.220> whoops

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.569 

and<00:03:58.060> then<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.360> put<00:03:59.769> blocks<00:04:00.769> on<00:04:01.099> top<00:04:01.129> of<00:04:01.459> each

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
and then you put blocks on top of each

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.640 
and then you put blocks on top of each
of<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.819> torches<00:04:02.209> except<00:04:02.689> for<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.079> two<00:04:03.349> on<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
of the torches except for the two on the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:13.899 
of the torches except for the two on the
ends<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:10.450> then<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.629> put<00:04:12.430> pistons<00:04:13.430> on<00:04:13.640> top<00:04:13.790> of

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
ends and then you put pistons on top of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.170 
ends and then you put pistons on top of
everything<00:04:14.920> or<00:04:15.920> not<00:04:16.100> not<00:04:16.519> on<00:04:16.669> top<00:04:17.030> of

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
everything or not not on top of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.249 
everything or not not on top of
everything<00:04:17.389> but<00:04:17.570> on<00:04:17.690> top<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:17.870> where<00:04:18.049> all<00:04:18.169> the

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
everything but on top of where all the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.040 
everything but on top of where all the
torches<00:04:18.620> are<00:04:22.150> that's<00:04:23.150> pretty<00:04:23.570> much<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.750> basic

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
torches are that's pretty much the basic

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.939 
torches are that's pretty much the basic
setup<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.310> need<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.610> add<00:04:25.940> some<00:04:26.949> repeater

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
setup you just need to add some repeater

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:37.719 
setup you just need to add some repeater
on<00:04:28.039> each<00:04:28.250> side<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.490> power<00:04:29.180> everything<00:04:36.729> and

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
on each side to power everything and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.029 
on each side to power everything and
that's<00:04:38.060> basically<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.510> did<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.500> just<00:04:39.620> repeat

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
that's basically it did you just repeat

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.700 
that's basically it did you just repeat
that<00:04:40.600> it's<00:04:41.600> modular<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.139> you<00:04:42.229> can<00:04:42.350> just<00:04:42.380> repeat

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
that it's modular so you can just repeat

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.980 
that it's modular so you can just repeat
that<00:04:42.919> as<00:04:43.180> for<00:04:44.180> as<00:04:44.270> long<00:04:44.389> as<00:04:44.449> you<00:04:44.600> want<00:04:44.810> really

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
that as for as long as you want really

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.620 
that as for as long as you want really
you<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:45.650> make<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.860> as<00:04:46.010> long<00:04:46.550> as<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.330> need

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
you can make it as long as you need

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.900 
you can make it as long as you need
whatever<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:48.080> needed<00:04:48.229> to<00:04:48.350> be<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:49.610> I'll<00:04:49.729> show

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
whatever you needed to be so I'll show

00:04:49.910 --> 00:05:00.159 
whatever you needed to be so I'll show
you<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.270> works<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.570> they<00:04:59.750> all<00:04:59.870> go<00:05:00.020> down

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
you that it works and they all go down

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:13.920 
you that it works and they all go down
and<00:05:01.039> up<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:08.800> that's<00:05:09.800> pretty<00:05:10.760> much<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:12.880> so

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
and up and that's pretty much it so
