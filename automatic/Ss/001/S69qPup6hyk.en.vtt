00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
dollars by the way or maybe it's not a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.229 
dollars by the way or maybe it's not a
code<00:00:47.100> word<00:00:47.280> maybe<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.969> really

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
code word maybe it's just a really

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389

how the world would eventually be
eviscerated<00:01:09.750> by<00:01:10.560> technology<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.330> was

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
eviscerated by technology you see it was

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
eviscerated by technology you see it was
inevitable<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.350> compound<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.430> be

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
inevitable that a compound would be

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
inevitable that a compound would be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
unstoppable force of destructive power

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.859 
unstoppable force of destructive power
that<00:01:23.790> would<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.030> lay<00:01:24.330> waste<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> everything

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that would just lay waste to everything

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.320 
that would just lay waste to everything
to<00:01:25.380> buildings<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.159> parks<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> streets<00:01:27.000> and
