00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.740
 well koller themes 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.010
 welcome back to another appointment in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 htc one company the younger brother 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.680
 of the ftc juan n 7 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.410
 as you can see it has a smaller display from 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.509
 42 inches diagonal and made 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.509
 even if the lumia there is a fact for the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.790
 frame which in this case is plastic 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.200
 we continue with the examination of the telephone 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.720
 we see that on the right side we have i 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.230
 volume adjustment rates in the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.230
 lower part the hole for insertion of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.430
 micro usb connector on the part 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.010
 left 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 the compartment for inserting dhalsim 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.240
 informed vitro while in the part 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
 top of the hole for inserting the 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.080
 3.5mm audio jack button 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.040
 switching on and off and locking of 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.590
 device 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.180
 unfortunately I can't let you see the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.980
 pack of general sales because 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.900
 htc already sent these packs 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.750
 the packaging that comes is also anonymous 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:12.920
 given to us who make video-reviews 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.220
 well let's keep talking about this 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.280
 phone via a great football in a row 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 even though he was running away now 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.990
 because being smaller it is possible to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.830
 better use with one hand 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 I wanted 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.700
 show the quality of the photos now 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.870
 entering the camera section 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.800
 I remind you that the htc one mini has one 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.420
 four ultrà pixel camera 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 in this case they are not used 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.050
 as you see when in fact 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 megapixel but htc always decides 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.780
 use this pixel I am in 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.230
 able to capture more light than 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.760
 traditional sensors in this case the 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.750
 result is good enough we say that 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.540
 the photos are slightly worse 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.880
 compared to those of the one is because they are 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.610
 a bit more noisy than the good ones instead 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.690
 macro as you can see we have the mode 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 active blue 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.670
 let's try to take some shots myself 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.680
 I also move with the phone because 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 because the phone in this case 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.890
 that is, record or better record 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 a few seconds what he is shooting 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.319
 in such a way that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 give me a series of frames I go up 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:40.790
 then decide which frame to save 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.680
 I put the camera cap back on 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 cover goal we go to the mode 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.450
 photo cameras begin a 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.409
 record that we are rising 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.000
 resolution 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.099
 we can thus to a sea during the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.500
 recordings and while at any party 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:00.650
 screen but also to take pictures 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:04.810
 photo the phone is around 400 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.730
 450 euros which is a great price 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.420
 we say that from the point of view of quality 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.069
 price is one of the best 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.079
 always talking about multimedia 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.950
 let's go into the mp3 song then into music 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.079
 in such a way as to make them feel goodness 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.139
 of the audio thanks to these two casts 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.209
 that htc as for the juan n 7 ha 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.569
 decided to position in the part 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.569
 higher 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.900
 how you say audio is really expensive yes 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.900
 feels really good 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.320
 now let's go to view a video e 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.530
 classic samsung video helicopter 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.730
 it grows in a very fluid way then 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.830
 we do not have any type of pointing 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.970
 really nice this 4.3 display 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.650
 inch 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.799
 we have the ability to take pictures 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.980
 excuse me during the registration 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.290
 video playback so not 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.270
 we have no problem for 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.920
 regarding the scartò also mentions with 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.920
 a 1080p video like this 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.490
 guessed according to me the choice of 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.800
 put the castes in the upper part 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.680
 why when we put the phone up 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.600
 we don't have a flat surface 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:52.520
 decreased sound as they came too 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:55.440
 if I move the video is always fluid 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:00.750
 let's talk now instead of broswer 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:06.180
 broswer that I found really great 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.230
 as well as juan n 7 to a series 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.230
 of functionality 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.880
 in my opinion very important or has 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.100
 the ability to view the site 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.380
 is in the right command mode 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.390
 especially and it is one of the few browsers 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.560
 to have the possibility to activate or 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.230
 disable the flash player at will 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.360
 and one of the few I know is the stop he has 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.130
 This possibility 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.870
 as you can see we are on the courier's website 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.560
 in the evening I don't have any kind of 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.740
 problem 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.220
 once I do the pinch to zoom wi 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.010
 fi text resais in China and up to 8 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.840
 with ok so I do n't have any kind of 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.000
 problem regarding the 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.070
 web browsing decreases a little 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.169
 brightness as you see the navigation 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.169
 really enjoyed let's go to our site 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.440
 www.conto.tv the opportunity to say to you 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.400
 all to register to our channel 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.009
 youtube to follow us also on facebook or 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.449
 twitter you can also read 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.559
 my name is mario disciple like 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.479
 see also our site comes 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.369
 loaded very fast not 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.770
 we have no problems whatsoever 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:29.270
 let's talk now about the telephone part 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.479
 calling the 190 I will tell you that the part 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.159
 telephone which is excellent for how much 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.409
 concerns the audio quality in capsules 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.839
 even my voice and maybe my voice 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.319
 slightly low voice but i am really i 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.319
 police 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:55.719
 good to work this device 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:59.409
 there is a snapdragon 402 processor agreement 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:03.669
 from 1.4 ghz gpu adreno 305 gen a jig of 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:08.469
 ram the memory is perhaps a bit of a crisis 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:09.759
 giga non expandable 7.28 to 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:16.389
 switching on then maybe this is it 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:19.719
 the only drawback we go to give say of the 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:23.110
 conclusions on this device that does not have 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:25.870
 nothing to envy of the other tops of 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.659
 range the economy is excellent as well as the 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.270
 display is one of the wasteful and beautiful that 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:35.110
 I have ever seen together with that of 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:37.180
 month that I consider the best and 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.060
 let's say we have a very good tini infili 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.740
 because the phone is very compact and yes 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.650
 manages to use well with one hand 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.439
 the materials used are also excellent 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.779
 only negative perhaps as I said to you is the 

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:52.539
 memory not expandable but colored 

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:55.150
 where around 400 euros and a device of 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:58.990
 buy with your eyes closed then again 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:03.240
 congratulations to htc good and everything from but the 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.240
 disciple for bubbles point it
