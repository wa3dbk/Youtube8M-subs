 bright gemstones and stylish technique 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 another world there he learned techniques 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.059
 stirring in precious stones like 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.190
 emeralds rubies sapphires crystal daemon 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.170
 red blue green his father was a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.539
 healer was the premiere that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.539
 studied these herbs and their effects 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.849
 medicines but the resonance of stones 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 It puzzled him, he studied them and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.590
 I could then master this kind of magic if 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 making a knight errant and fearless 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 protector of the weak and oppressed 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.920
 until one day he was summoned to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 He reiterates falling there without knowing what 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 happened it ended up being invoked to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.260
 join the league accepted the invitation 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.270
 They needed your help. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.820
 that they mean Arabic 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.949
 hammer a beautiful name pro téchiné 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 in the game he is left-handed but by some 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.809
 lack of attention has many plastic 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 showing him holding the hammer with 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 the right hand the passive of the terry that in 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.840
 English is called gm craft and has a game 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 called the craft the new bad magic 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 this land probably looks good 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 probably this will be a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 reference to rani soil status 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 since the magic used in the home 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.850
 office ended the geophysical state 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 of the continent of value is facing 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.500
 the purest power that exists technique 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 diamond rider and the diamond 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.850
 things like pure carbon gems is pure 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.700
 emotion 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.370
 really pure emotion is a reference 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:50.320
 to drawing programs 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:51.810
 the removal is not my very curious image 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.840
 draws 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.840
 during my name it's fine people 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:05.929
 the emerald is the opal knowledge 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.460
 harmony is the vigor the sapphire is the 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.860
 divinity 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.440
 we have the social to climb sapphire 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.060
 emerald and the paulo to the 12 aspects 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.830
 Divinity Solar 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.260
 I'm not sure what this is all about. 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.629
 sect religion thing of the type but in that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.360
 material you can see that for example 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:27.019
 when terry talking that sapphire 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.450
 deity the seawater aspect that 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.360
 waking sapphire really presents the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.879
 divine perception clarity and such emerald 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.090
 80 cover of this material 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.989
 green really presents the science and 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.180
 knowledge what commented that 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.030
 the lighter the game the excess of 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.190
 testosterone but then the idea came from 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.650
 a photo of a player of today was cref 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.109
 called penede photoshop landing 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.359
 armed with a paladin that was rosy 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.190
 even more fibula assis that was made 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.500
 to give another appearance cotec 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.090
 basically as if it were a universe 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 alternative is why he 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.459
 present gloomy characteristics 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.859
 sting and li na won the knight day 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.169
 and hematite can also be 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.299
 called black diamond and in case the 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:17.510
 normal technique would be the same diamond 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.579
 pure hematite if the black diamond does not 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.700
 me original of the spines blood stone that 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.250
 can be translated into it another pike 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.280
 is a mineral that can be black and 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.090
 red spots like the armor of the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.500
 corners 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.239
 I do not have anything to talk about 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.680
 technician if you think something is missing 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.720
 thing is how I'm going to read the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.310

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.430
 technician to hide Frank Aguiar 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.620

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.329
 make a similar request also 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.560

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.569
