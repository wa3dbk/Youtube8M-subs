yourself that you can beat the game
great<00:00:21.520> assuming<00:00:22.520> you're<00:00:22.670> an<00:00:22.790> average<00:00:22.970> winner

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
great assuming you're an average winner

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.570 
great assuming you're an average winner
and<00:00:23.689> playing<00:00:24.140> at<00:00:24.320> six<00:00:24.560> max<00:00:24.740> No<00:00:24.980> Limit<00:00:25.250> tables

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
and playing at six max No Limit tables

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.700 
and playing at six max No Limit tables
your<00:00:26.210> win<00:00:26.420> rate<00:00:26.450> comes<00:00:26.960> down<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:27.380> three<00:00:27.560> big

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
your win rate comes down to three big

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.430 
your win rate comes down to three big
bits<00:00:27.950> per<00:00:28.189> 100<00:00:28.730> hands<00:00:28.970> which<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.080> the

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
bits per 100 hands which is the

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.189 
bits per 100 hands which is the

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.820 
equivalent of six big blinds per 100
hands<00:00:33.760> right<00:00:34.760> what<00:00:35.420> does<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.600> mean<00:00:35.900> by

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
hands right what does that mean by

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.760 
hands right what does that mean by
playing<00:00:37.129> at<00:00:37.370> $25<00:00:38.150> tables<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.989> make<00:00:39.230> one<00:00:39.559> point

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
playing at $25 tables you make one point

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.439 
playing at $25 tables you make one point
$5<00:00:40.400> per<00:00:40.850> 100<00:00:41.570> heads<00:00:42.190> speaking<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.340> hands<00:00:43.760> about

$5 per 100 heads speaking of hands about

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.840 
$5 per 100 heads speaking of hands about
the<00:00:44.630> haven't<00:00:44.989> hands<00:00:45.320> are<00:00:45.590> dealt<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.579> span

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
the haven't hands are dealt in the span

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.690 
the haven't hands are dealt in the span
of<00:00:46.880> one<00:00:47.180> hour<00:00:47.950> therefore<00:00:48.950> it's<00:00:49.280> safe<00:00:49.520> to

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
of one hour therefore it's safe to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.970 
of one hour therefore it's safe to
assume<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:50.630> are<00:00:50.719> truly<00:00:50.989> making<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.620> back

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
assume that we are truly making a back

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.090 
assume that we are truly making a back
and<00:00:52.130> a<00:00:52.219> half<00:00:52.430> per<00:00:52.700> hour<00:00:52.850> playing<00:00:53.420> at<00:00:53.630> $25<00:00:54.620> six

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
and a half per hour playing at $25 six

and a half per hour playing at $25 six
max<00:00:55.309> No<00:00:55.640> Limit<00:00:55.940> tables<00:00:56.500> okay<00:00:57.500> that's<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.160> start

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
max No Limit tables okay that's a start

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.770 
max No Limit tables okay that's a start
and<00:00:58.640> that's<00:00:59.390> where<00:00:59.719> multi-tabling<00:01:00.320> comes<00:01:00.890> in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
and that's where multi-tabling comes in

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.600 
and that's where multi-tabling comes in
by<00:01:02.780> adding<00:01:03.200> tables<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.739> your<00:01:03.770> screen<00:01:04.190> you

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
by adding tables to your screen you

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.370 
by adding tables to your screen you
effectively<00:01:05.059> increase<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.810> number<00:01:06.080> of<00:01:06.110> hands

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
effectively increase the number of hands

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.460 
effectively increase the number of hands
you<00:01:06.500> play<00:01:06.800> per<00:01:07.009> hour<00:01:07.509> it's<00:01:08.509> table<00:01:08.810> wins<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.440> a
