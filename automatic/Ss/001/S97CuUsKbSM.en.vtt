see<00:02:27.000> where<00:02:27.359> to<00:02:27.510> cut<00:02:27.750> off<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.950> would<00:02:29.159> do<00:02:29.280> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
see where to cut off and I would do it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
see where to cut off and I would do it
closer<00:02:29.609> by<00:02:29.879> know<00:02:30.090> exactly<00:02:30.480> where<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.719> cut<00:02:30.870> off

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
closer by know exactly where to cut off

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.349 
closer by know exactly where to cut off
because<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.230> always<00:02:31.530> use<00:02:31.709> these<00:02:31.889> flashes<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.030> I

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
because I always use these flashes so I

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.509 
because I always use these flashes so I
would<00:02:33.629> cut<00:02:33.840> off<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:34.260> four<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:35.040> there's<00:02:35.310> like

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
would cut off at four so there's like

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.879 
would cut off at four so there's like
little<00:02:35.790> knots<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.870> two<00:02:37.170> three<00:02:37.409> four<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.829> so

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
little knots one two three four and so

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.860 
little knots one two three four and so
I'm<00:02:38.489> going<00:02:38.639> to<00:02:38.700> use<00:02:38.909> a<00:02:39.090> pair<00:02:39.359> of<00:02:39.389> stainless

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
I'm going to use a pair of stainless

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020 
I'm going to use a pair of stainless
steel<00:02:40.109> scissors<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.849> go

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
steel scissors and I'm just going to go

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.839 
steel scissors and I'm just going to go
ahead<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.420> cut<00:02:42.719> where<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> need<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.430> trim<00:02:44.670> off

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
ahead and cut where I need to trim off

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.360 
ahead and cut where I need to trim off
the<00:02:45.239> excess<00:02:45.689> basically<00:02:46.459> before<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.829> cut

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the excess basically before and just cut

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.330 
the excess basically before and just cut
off<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.549> excess<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> basically<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.189> the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
off the excess so basically you have the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.149 
off the excess so basically you have the
lashes<00:02:53.790> fit<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.720> eye<00:02:55.019> shape<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
lashes fit to the eye shape that you

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.459 
lashes fit to the eye shape that you
have<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:57.299> I'm<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.139> go

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
have and then I'm just going to do go

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.720 
have and then I'm just going to do go
