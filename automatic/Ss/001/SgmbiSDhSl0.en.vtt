00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.170
 my name is climate and age is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.170
 18 and just means link 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.700
 You know that you are the leader in advance 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 And yes then just for cheese shop 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 I did that it would be intimate and yes 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.260
 just as a task then we know 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.600
 when one can win 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 [Music] 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.789
 I am a left midfielder with 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.769
 I think good left leg to be strong 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.929
 and yes i think i already have the job 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.480
 which is very important 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.450
 in soccer 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:42.320
 [Music] 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.210
 it was certainly a big step today 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.930
 between politics but the trainer briefly with 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.360
 given the chance 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 no my debut in my chest and I think 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.590
 that it is so good for development before 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.420
 Of course you also have other small ones 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.850
 severe where then by show of yes that is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 and that it is good 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:08.810
 yes for us 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:10.430
 [Music] 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.720
 stand your goddess they stand slow and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.160
 bounce 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 he played for flow and unfortunately strong 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.710
 at the ball so yes I thought could 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
 shelter 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.860
 I thought when you put it on Easter maya 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.870
 it a naturally fantastic meeting point 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.090
 gone and chic tomorrow 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.460
 roof of goal so yes because if I do him 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.960
 akersloot 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 but is after us 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.680
 [Music] 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:45.580
 used to be 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:45.580
 [Music] 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.390
 I am overview I will go free in one 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.630
 roll but yes much rotation today was 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.240
 the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 zaccaria bakkali make many others 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.149
 side that is just tidy though 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.390
 start afterwards 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.030
 flawless 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.100
 [Music] 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.979
 nice shamans lay that has a lot 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.170
 and I shoot him contrarian attend 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.130
 from the far corner so yes it is 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.760
 nice to have a feyenoord 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.670
 jokes 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.370
 I played with the go you good one 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.410
 cheer and see you come missing 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.550
 devoted to my girlfriend 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:41.760
 yes she will be happy with him 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:43.989
 [Music] 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.700

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.989
 bring boil tjes from kid's show 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.760
 swapped jana 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.500
 also in knowledge is something in both myself 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.630
 You then have your mustache jump a few meters 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.520
 that pain lasts a little longer 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.380
 then before that can happen to you 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.180
 yes I do that often it is already 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.020
 I think it's smart holes 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.370
 have seven years as important 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.599
 [Music] 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.500
 So we have had games that 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.300
 still give away face only 3 0 and such 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.560
 team was on the field year then sat with 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.080
 a very nice and cool couch 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.590
 control and insist on lead 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:31.210
 yes then it is and coach stuff 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:34.210
 [Music] 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.320
 now again just at easy 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.670
 walk away and that is 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.670
 complement 10 i think
