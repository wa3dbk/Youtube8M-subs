00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.750 
in a while since I've watched Aladdin
but<00:02:01.510> as<00:02:02.020> far<00:02:02.230> as<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.470> remember<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:03.610> always

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
but as far as I remember they always

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.730 
but as far as I remember they always
come<00:02:04.000> up<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.240> spout<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.170> let's<00:02:08.350> try<00:02:08.619> and

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
come up the spout and so let's try and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.190 
come up the spout and so let's try and
make<00:02:08.770> this<00:02:08.979> look<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.280> bit<00:02:09.429> like<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.610> lump<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:13.200> mean

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
make this look a bit like a lump I mean

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.390 
make this look a bit like a lump I mean
I<00:02:14.290> guess<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.440> looks<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.890> lump<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.250> can

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I guess that looks like a lump we can

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.449 
I guess that looks like a lump we can
like<00:02:15.959> shade<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> bit<00:02:17.410> more<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> looks

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
like shade it in a bit more so it looks

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.020 
like shade it in a bit more so it looks
a<00:02:21.550> bit<00:02:21.580> more<00:02:21.850> shiny<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.620> okay<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:27.700> let's<00:02:27.910> work

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
a bit more shiny and okay now let's work

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.790 
a bit more shiny and okay now let's work
on<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.420> actual<00:02:28.720> genie<00:02:29.020> because<00:02:29.350> he<00:02:29.530> has<00:02:29.650> no

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
