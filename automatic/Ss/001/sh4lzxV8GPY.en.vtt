 then reverses confirming presence up here 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
 hence the possible ipo to get treatment 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.999
 after they press, it will appear 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.710

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.270
 We thought we had 4g 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.160

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.510
 everything to leave this 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.910
 there was also no fear of the penultimate 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.150
 for him again 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 when I asked again 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.440

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.210

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.769

 a bonus 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.019
