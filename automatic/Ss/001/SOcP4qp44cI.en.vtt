00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.440
 literal human survival that both 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.200
 can serve a man with everything in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.270
 an armchair seeing so much garbage after 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.130

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.870

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.870

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.559
 two shows on youtube one is that fitch and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.390
 the other is the one who rated where he talks about 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.420
 news and movies but better than we already 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.370
 tell how he makes these videos 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.180
 As it was the idea, it's a pleasure to be here 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.970
 with you 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.010
 I have two shows on YouTube one 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
 called fish that was the first with the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.300
 first I started that he was talking about 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.440
 news because I studied I am a graduate 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.520
 in communication sciences that 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.050
 study something that has to do with 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.570
 journalism and always called me a lot the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.990
 attention the news and all that and good 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.970
 afterwards I studied film and more than anything 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.290
 the videos are the combination of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.119
 things that I studied about the things that I 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.619
 they like the things that I love the most 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.990
 that nothing in youtube then of that 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.340
 it's a summary, that's why I'm doing cinema and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.630
 of news because it's something that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.520
 very passionate is something that I like 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.220
 lot and I'll meet and almost three 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.590
 years of being doing 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.080
 and then to this day, I do not know 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.180
 love what how did you start how 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.700
 you decided, I'm going to do my show today 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.979
 what do you say you started three years ago 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.570
 what was your idea when you start the idea 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.789
 is I started watching youtube and I started to see 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.439
 bloggers to see good people from usa 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.689
 that they made videos where they presented 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.640
 other funny videos and aisha then 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.070
 I said ah I would like to do something like this something 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.750
 similar so that my creativity does not 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.240
 I was stuck because I had 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.189
 then I worked in a television 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.560
 of editor in 2000 work was very very 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.509
 square and that's how I'm going to 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 burn the brain but something something soon 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.429
 I started making these writing videos 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.049
 scripts and write things and he had 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.900
 I made videos that did not deal with anything 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.670
 but after that it was like that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.500
 it happened to me so suddenly it could be 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.900
 father and talk about news of things 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.630
 that are fashionable then and little to 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.390
 little the news was taking shape and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.049
 this and it was becoming what is the day 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.870
 from today 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.880
 and the movie videos because I started already 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.599
 they were planned that I did think 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.599
 fairly good 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.319
 they were evolving until 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.510
 become who they are they do not see how it is 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.660
 your work team does it alone you have 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.850
 a team like that like its mergers or 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 if there are scripts or when the camera already 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.819
 start to leave 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.230
 it arrived early and I start to review 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.640
 you tell us good during the week I'm going 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.159
 compiling us is because it is with 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.690
 newsletter that weekly then during 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.250
 I'm going to compile them like the news 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.930
 most relevant or news that to me 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.629
 they call me attention will come to you with 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.340
 filiation and I already do a script with what 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.569
 it occurred to me at the same time 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.840
 that is recording I think more 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.670
 things and they all come out spontaneous I think that 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.310
 the spontaneous is the most fun what 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.700
 better than you do as in your normal day 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.640
 I know if your shows leave you as pay now 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.849
 dedicate 100% to them or have as 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.470
 many shows that besides youtube 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.690
 the shows one is dedicated to something else 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.370
 now the only shows I have where 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.120
 I leave where the protagonist was born 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.040
 those two and they are mine but there are other 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.989
 other days that I have recordings because 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 I have do web series for other channels 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.269
 of youtube and now I have two web 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.900
 series apart then there are days that are 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.239
 get see news record or get there is 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.030
 to write movie reviews or see the 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.440
 movies that there are equal record but there are 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.520
 other days that is to wait for the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.220
 actors 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.930
 wait the photographer will wait for the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.770
 production and there are other days that I have 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.500
 to edit those series of all there are days 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.410
 very busy there are very relaxed days like 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.210
 limited for example your scripts not 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.040
 partner and there's a point where you say 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.230
 I'm not going to say this, I'm not going to 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.560
 speak because it's not like the image that 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.209
 I want to give of the good thing on youtube is that 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.870
 there are no restrictions you can say what 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.550
 that you like it, if people are 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.710
 the one that puts you the restrictions and they 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.080
 they think it's something improper they start you 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.360
 beach in the video but outside of that you 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.970
 you are very free to express the things that 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.849
 you want the detail that one like 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.189
 although it is even 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.669
 it seems that it is pure newsreel game and 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.159
 we laugh and all one as a journalist does not 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.580
 you should not try to stay in the most 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:50.179
 possible goal then I do not like it 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.830
 my present a position before something there 

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.779
 very logical things that there are people who 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.789
 is very bad in his head as is obvious 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.619
 not here in China and in Russia and in two 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.959
 parts like so you're thinking no 

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:02.569
 but there are other news that are quite 

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:05.539
 controversial and where I limit myself only to 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.339
 saying this happened and this and people say 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.749
 this and the media say this other thing 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.539
 not for example the elections of the year 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.669
 passed by today it was not like that I do not 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.199
 I could turn my head on the side 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.269
 left and when he talked about amlo 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.699
 because I was already against amlo no 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:22.759
 It was like any little detail and any 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.309
 action or any look or expression what 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.029
 they took by hand or etcetera from any 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.330
 candidate then one has to be very 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:32.240
 objective 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.700
 and try to omit their views 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.400
 if you do not want to have 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.410
 problems that people do not anymore 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.780
 create now where we find you in 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.930

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.310

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.009
 same on twitter that already steal that fish 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.879

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.159
 Thank Roxy for coming but 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.599
 before he leaves I know that many 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:05.289
 comments of the videos that have 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.119
 youtube is because they have their cheeks and 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.309
 let me tell you that live are not 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:11.159
 so big I think it's more like when 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:13.240
 smile that the cheeks are inflated 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.169
 so I have a very question 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.169
 important to do 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.240
 they are soft it's amazing I know that 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.030
 many will envy me 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.070
 thank you very much for coming I do not know if
