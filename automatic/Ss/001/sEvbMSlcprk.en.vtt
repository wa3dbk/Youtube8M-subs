 And I'm just saying that the body is doing activities. 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:30.280
 It was only five years ago that Yoochun Lee started to take care of his health . 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:34.350
 He was the only one who did not receive a health checkup during his long official life 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.350
 I was so confident in my health. 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.780
 In 2001, however, severe abdominal pain was found. 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.970
 Test results are severe mucosal edema accompanied by inflammation eotta 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.290
 We found polyps with a high risk of developing hearing loss. 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.290
 A healthy person may be cancer. 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 There is a possibility of development. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.860
 Dan is now really over Kan . 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.250
 This is a big story about something like this 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.250
 If you do, loosen it and lining it. 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.590
 Mr. Lee has chosen fasting as an authority around him. 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.590
 I cut off my favorite numbers and started changing my lifestyle. 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.640
 It's one of those things, 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.959
 The breeze blows off the blanket and stimulates the skin to release waste products. 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.959
 It is known to help. 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 Chiropractors who help with blood circulation also keep steady every morning. 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:46.180
 The symptoms from him have disappeared and Yoo believes the disease is completely gone 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:52.750
 I went to a hospital in Chungmu. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:57.030
 I can not sum it up. 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:03.740
 I feel good and go to another one. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.740
 If you are diagnosed as being worse off in your life, 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.500
 In the past five years, the first recipient 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:18.450
 Like his belief, he's healed and his body is healthy. 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.290
 I had an endoscopy to check the current bowel condition . 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.430
 We performed a sleep endoscopy to reduce the pain in the test. 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.430
 The test results were amazing. 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.769
 Severe inflammation and swelling which causes deformation refrigerated until 2001 only woke clean 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.590

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.670
 The poly was gone. 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.580
 Fasting, like faith, heals his sickness 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.250
 Because the wind merger zoe is in its state 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:53.950
 To prevent that complication, even if there is any active treatment what is true 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:59.470
 That there needed to control the state I described as also mentioned earlier in the first 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.150
 I would say that in a very exceptional situation without two minutes being treated 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.930
 I will. 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.470
 Hopefully the good results coming months which remain inde What is injisangjeong 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.260
 I do not know. 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.409
 It is true that there are also two rooms . 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.290
 But now that I hear your words, 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:22.310
 It's a long time ago. 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:27.220
 I am feeling a lot better now, 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:30.849
 I will keep this kind of life in the future. 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.849
 Living healthy and making mistakes
