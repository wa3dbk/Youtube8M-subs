world

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920 
world
I<00:02:16.280> bet<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.819> would<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.030> never<00:02:17.180> said<00:02:17.420> ub40

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
I bet you would have never said ub40

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.780 
I bet you would have never said ub40
probably<00:02:18.680> not<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.190> know<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.430> kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.670> an

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
probably not you know that's kind of an

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.130 
probably not you know that's kind of an
insult<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.180> every<00:02:20.270> rock<00:02:20.510> metal<00:02:20.720> fan<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.080> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
insult to every rock metal fan in the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140 
insult to every rock metal fan in the
world<00:02:21.170> but<00:02:21.620> fair<00:02:22.250> enough<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.670> know<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.819> each

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
world but fair enough you know to each

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
world but fair enough you know to each
their<00:02:23.180> own<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:24.530> do<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.680> think<00:02:24.890> what<00:02:25.250> do<00:02:25.310> you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
their own what do you think what do you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.730 
their own what do you think what do you
think<00:02:25.520> we<00:02:25.760> had<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.510> know<00:02:26.630> honestly<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.380> know

think we had you know honestly you know

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.949 
think we had you know honestly you know
I<00:02:27.770> think<00:02:27.890> it's<00:02:28.130> more<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.880> statement<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
I think it's more a statement on the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.660 
I think it's more a statement on the
speaker<00:02:30.230> system<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.980> sound<00:02:31.220> man<00:02:31.430> perhaps

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
speaker system and the sound man perhaps

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.130 
speaker system and the sound man perhaps
not<00:02:31.970> mixing<00:02:32.420> things<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.840> she<00:02:32.990> suggests

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
not mixing things that she suggests

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.470 
not mixing things that she suggests
rather<00:02:34.010> than<00:02:34.130> ub40<00:02:34.640> actually<00:02:34.970> being<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.300> land

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
rather than ub40 actually being a land

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.120 
rather than ub40 actually being a land
band<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:36.020> that's<00:02:36.230> kind<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.470> preposterous

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
band that's that's kind of preposterous

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.190 
band that's that's kind of preposterous
you<00:02:37.220> know<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.430> fighting<00:02:37.730> talk<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.180> mean<00:02:39.020> I

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
you know it's fighting talk I mean I

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.170 
you know it's fighting talk I mean I
said<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.280> always<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.790> was<00:02:40.940> always

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
said there is always that was always

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.760 
said there is always that was always
that<00:02:41.330> thing<00:02:41.480> about<00:02:41.660> particularly<00:02:42.530> among

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
that thing about particularly among

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.589 
that thing about particularly among
heavy<00:02:42.920> metal<00:02:43.250> bands<00:02:43.430> about<00:02:43.700> who<00:02:44.209> was<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
heavy metal bands about who was the

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.140 
heavy metal bands about who was the
loudest<00:02:44.780> band<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.099> I<00:02:46.340> guess<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.700> depends<00:02:47.000> on

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
loudest band and I guess it depends on

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.190 
loudest band and I guess it depends on
the<00:02:47.270> size<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.690> room<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.050> you're<00:02:48.140> in

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
the size of the room that you're in

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.839 
the size of the room that you're in
because<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.830> can<00:02:48.980> create<00:02:49.250> an<00:02:49.340> awful<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.790> know

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
because you can create an awful you know

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.610 
because you can create an awful you know
if<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.209> relatively<00:02:50.750> small<00:02:51.320> room

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
if it's this relatively small room

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.440 
if it's this relatively small room
besides<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.130> studio<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.820> put<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
besides this studio and you put a you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.510 
besides this studio and you put a you
know<00:02:53.510> wall<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.930> speakers<00:02:54.170> up<00:02:54.620> against<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> you

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
know wall of speakers up against it you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.900 
know wall of speakers up against it you
could

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
could

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.370 
could
they<00:02:56.120> went<00:02:56.360> out<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.720> room<00:02:56.900> oh<00:02:57.140> that's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
they went out of this room oh that's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.510 
they went out of this room oh that's
right<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.740> this<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.220> common<00:02:58.460> misconception

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
right but this is a common misconception

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.370 
right but this is a common misconception
about<00:02:59.000> rocket<00:02:59.390> metal<00:02:59.600> there's<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.840> craft<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.290> it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
about rocket metal there's a craft to it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.470 
about rocket metal there's a craft to it
you<00:03:00.500> know<00:03:00.590> it's<00:03:00.770> not<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:00.950> about<00:03:01.220> volume<00:03:01.820> you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
you know it's not just about volume you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.210 
you know it's not just about volume you
know<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.810> about<00:03:02.990> creating<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.650> feeling<00:03:03.920> you

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
know it's about creating a feeling you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.130 
know it's about creating a feeling you
know<00:03:04.310> Motorhead<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.240> know<00:03:05.360> their<00:03:05.600> mantra<00:03:05.990> is

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
know Motorhead you know their mantra is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.030 
know Motorhead you know their mantra is
everything<00:03:06.500> louder<00:03:06.590> than<00:03:06.770> everything<00:03:06.950> else

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
everything louder than everything else

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.230 
everything louder than everything else
and<00:03:07.310> there's<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.520> reason<00:03:07.820> why<00:03:07.850> it's<00:03:08.090> because

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
and there's a reason why it's because

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240 
and there's a reason why it's because
they<00:03:08.300> do<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:08.690> well<00:03:08.900> she<00:03:09.830> was<00:03:09.950> talking<00:03:10.220> about

they do it so well she was talking about

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.890 
they do it so well she was talking about
it<00:03:10.370> feeling<00:03:10.670> like<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> steam<00:03:11.090> train<00:03:11.360> crashing

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900

especially before 1991 it isn't just
about<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.660> brutality<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.200> also<00:03:57.320> about<00:03:57.500> the

me why it is a good thing that the bass
is<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:42.800> pumping<00:04:43.430> aloud<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.570> you<00:04:44.690> feel<00:04:44.990> it

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
is so pumping aloud that you feel it

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.780 
is so pumping aloud that you feel it
kind<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.530> almost<00:04:45.860> physically<00:04:46.310> hitting<00:04:46.700> you
