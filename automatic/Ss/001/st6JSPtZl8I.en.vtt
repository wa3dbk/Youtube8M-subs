00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.080
 how they evaluate the show's result and the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.430
 experience of having been in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.790
 lollapalooza 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:22.650
 well the first thing for us to open was 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.510
 an important and difficult challenge always 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.910
 open an event so it's complicated 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 for the hour is a full day not everything 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.920
 world arrives early is a schedule 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 complicated by the sun people are at 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.620
 sun in fact and I in my case the personal 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.180
 exceeded the expectations of the day arrived 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 many people and arriving has been adding 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 election and the line coming up people 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
 there are public centers and expolios 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.920
 all wonderful about committed to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 what we were doing to the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 just like us with them actually 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.149
 Personally, I'm leaving with so many 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520
 and it was beautiful coming back smelling the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.780
 energy is beautiful the diverse public child 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.670
 is third them really very cute 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.770
 see in this presentation the possibility 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.890
 to expand can be done some 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.030
 international tour so if yes 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.760
 it is clear that if we are 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.940
 willing to what comes and discuss it 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.150
 and quietly study it but if 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.750
 clear of all ways happy to travel 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.000
 and continue to expand our public that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.430
 reach a lot of people 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.400
 you told me he had already given 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 possibility of being in lollapalooza and 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 there were some issues why I do not know 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.370
 concretized but now yes as it evaluates in 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.070
 this result of having been able to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.360
 final in this recipe Carlos after 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.740
 two years as he evaluates it positively 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240
 especially because 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 what we thought would happen 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.210
 let's say it was fulfilled in that sense of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.610
 have an open power coverage 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.200
 this festival and a margin of public that 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.320
 although we did not know what it was 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.690
 certain statistic but he responded 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.480
 absolutely and leaves us quiet 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.030
 have opened this 2013 version that does not 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.769
 it's less then we also had that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.170
 strength as a band say if you can 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.640
 say and let's play the subway and go 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.130
 touching us we keep playing 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.769
 we will continue playing and there will already be masters 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.769
 then there is security the band also 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.160
 of that are March year of street work 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.200
 and of scenarios 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.690
 which is coming now for the concussion band 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.540
 comes some tour some new album 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.190
 Well the first thing in the short term is the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.310
 launch of our first baby should 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.440
 of shipping that takes a little bit the milestone of 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.390
 do and two almost three years until when 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 We were 10 years old and they need each other 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.790
 3,500 people arrived that was beautiful 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.970
 that was recorded and complemented with other 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.980
 images of let's say another presentation 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.930
 rehearsal interview that let's say we're in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.319
 that's already planning what the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.719
 launch that will be very soon 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.069
 let's say good to keep working thinking 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:15.159
 on a third record and playing and playing and 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.159
 touch 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.510
 something they want to tell the public with 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 so to tell you about this experience 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.720

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.400
 as Italo said it was a challenge to open and 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.490
 happy to have seen so many people 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.130
 early so it's a message and that 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.000
 enjoy having a good time recycling 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:45.010
