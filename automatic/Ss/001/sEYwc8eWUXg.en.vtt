you know you watch a team get up in
football<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.209> then<00:03:21.209> they<00:03:21.329> go<00:03:21.359> into<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
football and then they go into the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.319 
football and then they go into the
prevent<00:03:22.230> defense<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:23.160> I've<00:03:23.489> always<00:03:23.970> said

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
prevent defense and I've always said

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.030 
prevent defense and I've always said
that's<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.870> that's<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.260> terrible<00:03:25.620> thing<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.980> it

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
that's a that's a terrible thing so it

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
that's a that's a terrible thing so it
doesn't<00:03:26.069> prevent<00:03:26.370> anything<00:03:26.819> okay<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
doesn't prevent anything okay and the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.390 
doesn't prevent anything okay and the
team<00:03:28.139> ends<00:03:28.349> up<00:03:28.500> losing<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:29.190> what

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
team ends up losing and that's what

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.770 
team ends up losing and that's what
happened<00:03:29.730> last<00:03:29.819> night<00:03:29.970> he<00:03:30.180> sold<00:03:30.419> out<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.599> think

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
happened last night he sold out I think

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.149 
happened last night he sold out I think
there<00:03:31.049> were<00:03:31.139> moments<00:03:31.470> where<00:03:31.859> there<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.069> an

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.830 
there were moments where there was an
attempt<00:03:32.609> at<00:03:32.669> challenge<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.359> didn't<00:03:33.629> seem

heartfelt they didn't seem like the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
facts but again is it this question of

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.250

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
that way he has to and I think this

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.630

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.140 
morning he realized we have 90 more
minutes<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:08.060> talk<00:05:08.210> about<00:05:08.510> all<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.660> this<00:05:08.840> delay
