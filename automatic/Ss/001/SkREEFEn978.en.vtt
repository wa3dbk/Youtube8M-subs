00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.190
 Chameleon friends here and there. 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.630
 video of today I come with news to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.430
 respect of pokémon xey high few 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 days for its launch 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.609
 and today, September 25 plus one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.020
 pokémon was revealed by the official website 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.809
 blade pokémon the evolution of ronald 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.420
 now he turns into two swords 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.540
 however it maintains almost all its 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.730
 features except color 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.960
 and also maintains its ability to guard 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.809
 it is not yet known if this will be the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.390
 final evolution of roland since the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.079
 most pokémons objects let's say 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 always end up with a third way 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.420
 then a new commercial came out 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 fourth 1 network promoting pokémon xi and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.869
 y commercial we can see various styles 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.390
 clothes the characters are wearing 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.320
 the most intriguing is that a new blur 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 appeared exactly to the exact eight 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.619
 seconds of the commercial 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 we can see what looks like a new 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.340
 pokémon some people think that it is not 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.860
 a new pokémon 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.299
 and I'm not very close, there are more rumors 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.259
 a strong rumor came out this weekend 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.650
 in which iv will have another evolution and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.049
 not only Sylvio as everyone still thought 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.200
 I do not know what your new type will be 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.659
 but there are strong chances of being dressed and there 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.810
 What do you think is missing very few 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.670
