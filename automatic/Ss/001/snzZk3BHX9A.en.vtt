00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.580
 I find for a new video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.730
 riding stable 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.620
 because the first is finally cardboard 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.920
 for me it was cardboard because when 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.809
 even that was my first video so 2005 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 are seen it was still great thank you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.960
 to 51 subscribers and so I had already done 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.180
 this video on my new channel but 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 do not worry I will continue a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 ammann is deduced it's just that one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.760
 know how to defend did not come home 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.660
 for a long time so we do not have too much 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.010
 time to make videos but that's it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.059
 it's okay so here they are 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.180
 find for a new video 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 centered castres so that was my 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.850
 old I stopped him because of the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.890
 snow 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.180
 because it's really boring then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 I had already advanced well so we're going 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.590
 not start so so first one 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.809
 first it's a first track 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.160
 of obstacles and there and a bug 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.770
 so I showed you it's a bug 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.379
 interstellar in any case in the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.960
 first video was already there here we go 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:12.600
 here you go 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.549
 you see it's a little boring but 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.320
 it does not matter at all more than six 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 parts 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 so I continue so the aea the meadows 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.790
 so this is the stable of the young horses 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.259
 that I work so except body is there 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 I do not realize that I have a pack of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.579
 textures and that I did not do that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 pack there but it's okay I 'm not going 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.229
 change the pack I know there was a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.400
 deluge and bugs 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.229
 I do not know what's going on but has 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.229
 points out that this is not normal 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 so it's not a sorry race so our 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 hands this video I had been asked 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 why do not you say the name of the horses 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 because we have a lot and the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.450
 video lasted an hour so that's the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
 main arena with the horses of this 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.570

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.990

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.430

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.690

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.920
