00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
rare game it came out in 1992 near the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.169 
rare game it came out in 1992 near the
end<00:01:57.080> of<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.289> NES<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.770> life<00:01:58.009> cycle<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.030> guess

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
end of the NES is life cycle so I guess

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.729 
end of the NES is life cycle so I guess
sunsoft<00:01:59.810> just<00:02:00.080> thought<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:00.410> wouldn't<00:02:00.619> be

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
sunsoft just thought it wouldn't be

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:02.109 
sunsoft just thought it wouldn't be
worth<00:02:00.860> releasing<00:02:01.489> anywhere<00:02:01.819> other<00:02:01.970> than

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
worth releasing anywhere other than

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.240 
worth releasing anywhere other than
those<00:02:02.360> territories<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.649> be<00:02:03.739> honest<00:02:04.009> they

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
those territories but to be honest they

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.669 
those territories but to be honest they
really<00:02:04.580> should<00:02:04.759> have<00:02:05.209> because<00:02:05.629> of<00:02:05.989> all<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.379> did

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679
