00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello today we have a review on 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.450
 portable very powerful console 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.550
 which is called and mode game 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 first look at the package 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.150
 there are a lot of interesting things 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.559
 console on us charger 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 in about two two and a half hours 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 you can charge the console from the outlet 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.180
 here we have a special connector 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.369
 instruction 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.689
 after that is he ran the cable in order 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.460
 to insert into the console all 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 usb accessories like mouse 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 keyboard or even a 3g modem then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.369
 We have very good quality headphones 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 This is a headphone plugs with rubberized 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.930
 The basis of the sound is quite good for a movie for 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.450
 music for games is all great 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
 further what we have last is mini 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.840
 usb usb cable to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.399
 sync with computer addition 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 to transfer all sorts of game content 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.870
 movies music and stuff like that 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 look more at the console itself 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.780
 our body is plastic it is very 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.879
 thin light 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 and we'll start with the display here 7 inches 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.020
 1024 by 600 display supporting five 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 simultaneous touches 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.739
 next you need to sit down various buttons 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 such as starts or somewhere so much 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.850
 Prefixes cross and here we have 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.690
 there is an analog stick to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.610
 character panel 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.290
 all the buttons are very well located and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 it is easy to reach them also there are two 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 cock on top and now 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 look at the back here with us 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.000
 you can see two big speakers here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 stereo sound great volume here 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.479
 there is a rear camera in order to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.119
 take photos and shoot videos and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.159
 here drowning under the button cutter to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.080
 what to do console reset now 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
 look at the ports and communications 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.070
 here we have two triggers as i have 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.920
 said on the top face further audigy2 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 headphone hdmi output and miniusb in order 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.579
 to switch it to make the computer 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.860
 on the right side we have 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.530
 micro sd card reader for support 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.990
 cards up to 32 GB power button and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 charger socket now 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.189
 look at the remaining face here at 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840
 we have nothing interesting 13 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.939
 millimeters total console thickness 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.210
 very thin at us from the bottom side 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.890
 us also nothing 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.630
 account arms makes it very nice 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.250
 plastic case it is very light 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.290
 thin right here is us front camera 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 to chat on skype or 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.380
 some other fireplace inclined things or 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.150
 shoot yourself and post in 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 instagram and in general all this is not 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.360
 creaks no backlash very well 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.619
 fingerprints done no remains 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.810
 matte case 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.209
 Well , our protective glass hides 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680
 the display now look at the weight there 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.569
 prefix quite a bit like me already 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.100
 spoke only 360 grams that is it 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.060
 very light and easy to take 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.220
 you can't take off your pocket 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.230
 as for the apparatus is not filling here 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.910
 dual core processor and 1 gigabyte 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.100
 RAM but 8 megabytes 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.530
 internally store now look at 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.510
 operating system on the left under 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.709
 the crosspiece we have buttons 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.660
 volume control 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.980
 volume + and volume minus here 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.750
 what they are and a below 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.340
 duplicated on screen 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.350
 key volume can be adjusted 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.540
 physical keys or touch 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.459
 buttons below the game further standard 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.470
 back home adventure launched 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.090
 applications but what's interesting is the same 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.350
 physically duplicated us 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.330
 Here we set the color, that is, you can go home 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.980
 come back here with this button and 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.480
 here there is a button that opens 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.950
 the menu is also quite convenient not 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.540
 you can poke all over the screen 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.430
 do physical keys which 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.930
 the response is still better here it is 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.489
 She opens the last button 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.980
 programm motor to us 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.750
 our key crosses hammers hammered all 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.340
 the rest is in the right places on the screen a little 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.590
 I'll show you later how this whole thing works. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.299
 Of course the prefix supports us 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.100
 google service and this is an assistant on 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.989
 based cards that shows us 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.030
 the way home offers all sorts of restaurants 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.470
 cafe average weather information on 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 public transport and others 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.290
 similar things based on our 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.239
 displacements based on our requests 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.769
 google and stuff like that 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.540
 updating our favorite sites will 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.489
 show a very handy thing now 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.140
 let's go setup and see what we have 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.850
 here we only have a standard 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 shell from android without any there on 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.989
 wacky improvements because everything is fine as 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.630
 google conceived operating system 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.829
 us android 4 2 2 is the latest version of u 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.840
 us updated system 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.670
 and jellybin here android very 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.620
 works well stable version so 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.329
 that's all cool now look at 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.739
 pre-installed applications where 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.600
 prohibited extensive application package 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.370
 the most interesting of course is an emulator and 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.109
 all sorts of consoles but there are also 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.820
 many other things there are interesting 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.709
 nice player here of course 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.330
 reader but no one bothers here 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.070
 install any of your programs 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.720
 also here is a large set of widgets for 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.030
 desktop that can be set 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.970
 for quick access to almost messages 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.170
 weather and other things 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.730
 Of course, we have a preinstalled 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.860
 the marketplace application can be 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.810
 download programs for android so well 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.730
 same movies music games and any other 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.200
 apps from the play market here 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.180
 official google store which 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.710
 works fine besides and again that 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.750
 interesting this is this this application 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.000
 which is below right here 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.470
 here she is very interesting she allows 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.540
 we install different emulators 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.280
 consoles and run games with them all 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.380
 Of course, it's free to download all this from 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.240
 Internet and starts with nintendo gameboy 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.670
 advance even sega mega drive and the 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.620
 things like that world he is buttress excellent 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.630
 it works here and where the game has 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.490
 for girls so for boys game for 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.080
 the boy is clearly a man run so far and shoots 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.390
 perfectly controlled with buttons like on 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.580
 nintendo with everything is great 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.020
 every mega drive is a game about barbie but 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.400
 i'm honest about barbie not 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.350
 I liked all girl probably 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.450
 i like somehow for barbie nikkun 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.070
 here's a fisherman about he cultures in the trenches i'm 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.990
 childhood very fond of this same game about 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.670
 android as we remember we have a dual-core 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.990
 the processor is also modern games here 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.910
 android is quite nice here 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.590
 feels of course also we have 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.480
 g-sensor so you can control with 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.890
 using the display rotation not my game 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.380
 about the race here you can steer 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.940
 now fifa 14 also under android here 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.070
 here I will show how the program works 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.720
 michael as you can see is supposed and 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.250
 control the game using on-screen 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.290
 gestures that is on the screen as if 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.610
 so many buttons in the fruit both plant 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.440
 the whole thing is on our physical keys 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.270
 so as not to block the screens which is more convenient 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.070
 the whole thing is push here four here 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.140
 buttons on the decline all sorts of motion blows 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.970
 on the left we have a cross market run 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.740
 mapper program and we're just on the screen 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.300
 we place the necessary elements in the necessary 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.040
 we will move the places 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.260
 under the virtual style under the left side 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.240
 for the buttons we will place on the right 4 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.350
 keys but there are still two trigger here 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.760
 left right but we won't them 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.129
 use in this game they are not needed 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.229
 there are four buttons 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.969
 and now we can rule the physical 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.289
 keys as you can see is like 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.569
 we would just not swipe across the screen 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.129
 pushed you we push the buttons in 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.050
 first we have free space on the screen 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.489
 there is much more and secondly on 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.379
 physical buttons push much 

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:03.629
 nicer than what is on the screen that can 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.639
 don't work or overshoot and so 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.289
 we will end up with i'm old games 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.539
 Well, first it should be noted right away 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.419
 rich package bundle here with us and 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.429
 usb charger and headphones and he 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.469
 ran the cable itself imagine no 3g but 

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:18.419
 You can buy inexpensive 3G modems through 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.339
 he is naked there to install it is cool 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.110
 that included all the more it does not have 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.669
 only we have a game console but I'll get up 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.439
 full android tablet with 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.599
 cameras with good dynamics can
