00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.600
 hello to all here mine 2 12 so 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.610
 this is for a new episode on hiatus 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.010
 cam so first I wanted to tell you 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.660
 thank you a course thank you to everyone who 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.460
 have subscribed on my channel so we 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.670
 is already at forty seven as travels what 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.630
 it will continue to rise so I hope so 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.340
 all this but very strongly to put 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.470
 more videos to put the best 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.600
 content to improve on my channel 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.930
 so feel free to comment on the fall 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 dax is always a pleasure 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.040
 so that's after 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.540
 the trick 40 years curious the trick kama 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.400
 is to use the subway is in 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.500
 road for the rhune peace so 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.230
 especially you have 5 15% chance 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.830
 to have a European and the recipe is 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.750
 mediocre but I believe that in the 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.170
 version of wood 10 will exchange the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.729
 recipe 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.490
 so maybe she'll be higher up 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.869
 make it so profitable or that it was for 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.450
 the moment the bodies so well drunk 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.850
 were pretty sure of that so I'll get you 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.850
 show this right away so 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 start with the resources so that I 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.979
 believed in a drop of water you did not 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.600
 need 4 so you see it you 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.670
 cost nothing for me to be bourdy 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.630
 winner type read wool wool that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.880
 takes 1.39 what now its 39 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:51.229
 so just to be on their guard and 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:56.360
 39 votes 39 ' the dutch reims 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.090
 reindeer 2 royalmount thirty of 43 and 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
 knives August 5am goodwood 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.580
 by the way three cures of food tonight 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.280
 mounted 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.399
 4 that suddenly air people and an ad 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.990
 nothing but who does it cost you 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.599
 about because he comes back I do not 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.910
 a few pounds compliment prince and 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.990
 if not for a video so there I would like 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.780
 no 5 million threshold at all as 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.640
 then sammy the wool you do not have 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.960
 need 30 so a little like 5000 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.230
 already agreed 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.930
 then he would have needed 43 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.860
 I believe 43 so you make a lil 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.260
 still a little 25 minutes so 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:49.030
 just 75000 plus maybe it's 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:52.060
 80 miles or more then we need to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.280
 translate in eight thousand times 3 gives 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.410
 not 4000 yet if you go 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.870
 easily to go into it is then 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:09.220
 royal you see I bought a TV whose 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:13.300
 3000 and 11 km route costs 5000 max so 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.370
 you see for some 515 miles you 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.470
 have a friend the road Trojans but 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.660
 maybe she's resources for 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.600
 another one so he's here we're going to go to 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.400
 the TV when I eat to crush 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.410
 this is so I do live what 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.900
 is very special so do not tell you 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.430
 really what I have to see how a 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.600
 beach tools I have no street so the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.440
 music that they crack in by a 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.280
 since myself know so yes breeze 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:50.290
 and you get a rune had 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.410
 outfits so hot like that our one so 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.600
 we 'll see if luck has turned out less 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.519
 we are going to be radios were people 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:06.540
 well I believe so 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:10.390
 but I still have no law or power 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:17.320
 develop a genial so 2 out of 3 that's 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:21.519
 extremely well now we'll see to 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.910
 the jv how these contents 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.669
 reindeer loses a peace so you see 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.930
 189 me just one street can 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.750
 totally repay the fear and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.659
 have a small profit of about 40,000 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:39.870
 so here I can put it at a good price 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:42.310
 so 189 run me so it's going so fast 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.400
 so you also have fire runes 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.349
 say good sales strength 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.280
 of hard blow indoor water do you 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:55.349
 what dolphin window starts 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.400
 fire that's it 80 of the finals she prays 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:05.319
 so still a small profit in more 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.900
 common are like that also say an ad 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.460
 prost 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.990
 for ross 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.780
 how much do I say a prost chair 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.759
 give that makes you a lot diminishes and 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.199
 it's not super profitable 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.000
 you have rugby I think the 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:33.550
 streets a life is quite expensive 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:35.949
 yes and no ravine ravi delighted 38 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:42.460
 minutes and so still a small profit 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:45.300
 plus I like is 36 miles so in 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.500
 it's pretty awesome 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:56.349
 so that's it so I'm not telling you anymore 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:06:00.090
