00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.860
 ah 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.150
 position 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.029
 we show 5 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.029
 and that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.260
 little to add I write only computers 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.899
 to the playground here I was watching 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.329
 the dollar and also duck milan had the 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.010
 path 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.550
 I live much more balanced 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.799
 corinthians also blunt to all 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.049
 lights I think this will come in handy and that 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.649
 corrective in time for the solos of 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:02.670
 face what comes thinking about what 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.049
 is played in South America in this tournament and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 35 minutes will come the second goal of the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.479
 party without a doubt one of the best 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.130
 players was this warrior who had 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.570
 getting the second goal of the game in 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.280
 sant interesting comment a 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.420
 centrodelantero that ends moving 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.490
 very well and that ended up fighting in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.560
 some moments with gandolfi and with 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.569
 aguilar but good here ends up getting 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.369
 the second goal of the game and a goal that 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.869
 I gave him samples of what was 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.509
 happening in this field when he does 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.850
 a lot of time that a team did 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.000
 disappear to xolos of tijuana the team 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.520
 of Turkish and I think today was this the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.759
 case here we are seeing the third goal 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.700
 that already ended the meeting and that 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.039
 Of course, well , the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.659
 puntilla the case of paulinho arrives there 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.560
 they say headbutts in the area is 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.200
 goal making good this maximum body 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 of the place 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.810
 nothing to do to follow the willows if 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 the third goal confirmed the difference 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.960
 between a computer and the other though the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.610
 same time Ion equipment deal 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.469
 but hey it did not reach him for 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.640
 consequent at least one goal in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.640
 change the local team finished
