00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:17.140
 E. coli that glows when exposed to black light 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:25.599
 It is made by genetic modification 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:27.760
 On- site class of genetic modification experiment to make this bright opening money is held in Oita Prefectural Kunisaki Senior High School 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 The 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.460
 This on-site class is part of the spp science partnership project 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.410
 Doing the power of 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.410
 That can not be easily lion relationship 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.640
 Thank you for solving problems 19 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.810
 Carried out that way, such things 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.770
 It is a program for 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:55.260
 It is this time Electrons used in the good scenery committee 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.260
 There is a shadow that hits the 5th plug cool 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.820
 Green system 8 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.470
 Yakushiji u pin 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.330
 You fall in love with suffering from the same person 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.890
 It is one of the cars 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.890
 The second one is 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.400
 A system to fill out from the addition is to hear the right child recombinant Toka biotechnology eddy Kashii 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.140
 cook 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.500
 It is familiar to Fu that'm so easy to have Will is asked to actually doing 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.600
 I feel I can feel it 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:30.640
 This time we will carry out genetic modification experiments of prescription 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.490
 Take out the gene from E. coli into which the glowing gene has been incorporated in advance 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.210
 Those that incorporated into another E. coli 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.140
 It is the second grader of science course to participate in experiment 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.190
 Will it work 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.010
 What you give us me more than ever 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.260
 Thank you 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.040
 Try to listen in sight 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.800
 I am making a part that I want to precipitate microorganisms from now on 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.980
 Take out the glowing gene from E. coli cells 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.110
 The cell wall was fragile with the reagent 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.960
 Separate with centrifuge 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.659
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.429
 It is registered used car because it was 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.280
 To Inaei co-star 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.900
 Not by 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.900
 I will destroy it by Yuyu 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.360
 Is transparent but how 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.140
 Wo changes that favor by the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.140
 See you again 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 me 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.980
 It will not come 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:48.080
 none 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.790
 Genes deposited in microtubes and removed from E. coli 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.790
 It is a plasmid dna 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.670
 Next, you can sell the extracted gene to E. coli 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.110
 What 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.570
 This 40-person 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.570
 We have this in both hands 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.160
 I will talk in 10 seconds in the mountains 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.650
 It is only work of this 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.480
 The size of the tax amount that the electron enters 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.500
 Interested Well this say also holds I gene recombinant today is through the wind efforts is 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.069
 take it 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.530
 It says that it would be good if a habitual researcher grew up from the stratum 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:44.850
 There is not even big 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.850
 All you have to do is apply the key to the medium and outline it overnight 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.730
 2 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.580
 go ah ah 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.569
 me 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.660
 Climate and Oops 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.580
 I thought it was a little difficult 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.580
 Because it was surprisingly easy 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.080
 After all that can be seen by experiment 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:23.920
 I like things that I don't understand only in business and I can understand them well 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:27.680
 But I'm gay but I'm selling for him 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.920
 Such an experiment can be full of things 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.569
 I think that was in the profession 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.319
 me 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.319
 me
