00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
know the dredge who are going to come in

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.669 
know the dredge who are going to come in
and<00:01:52.189> start<00:01:52.939> setting<00:01:53.329> up<00:01:53.420> camp<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.170> moving<00:01:54.560> on

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
and start setting up camp and moving on

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.099 
and start setting up camp and moving on
in<00:01:54.890> areas<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.119> can<00:01:56.240> also<00:01:56.359> stop<00:01:56.659> huge

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
in areas and you can also stop huge

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.529 
in areas and you can also stop huge
dragons<00:01:57.799> from<00:01:58.009> coming<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.640> taking<00:01:59.270> over

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
dragons from coming in and taking over

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.410 
dragons from coming in and taking over
an<00:01:59.749> area<00:01:59.929> and<00:02:00.289> corrupting<00:02:01.189> all<00:02:01.939> sorts<00:02:02.359> of

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
things and so these these dynamic events

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.029 
things and so these these dynamic events
always<00:02:04.460> change<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.789> area<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.390> chain<00:02:05.689> and

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
always change the area and the chain and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.529 
always change the area and the chain and
each<00:02:07.039> event<00:02:07.369> whether<00:02:07.639> it<00:02:07.819> be<00:02:07.969> success<00:02:08.360> or

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
each event whether it be success or

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.330 
each event whether it be success or
failure<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.110> lead<00:02:09.289> into<00:02:09.440> other<00:02:09.590> events<00:02:10.160> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
failure can lead into other events and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340 
failure can lead into other events and
this<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.150> kind<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.360> one<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.690> key<00:02:11.900> points<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
this is kind of one of the key points to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.020 
this is kind of one of the key points to
our<00:02:12.440> event<00:02:12.650> system<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.370> no<00:02:13.760> matter<00:02:13.790> how

our event system is that no matter how

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.660 
our event system is that no matter how
