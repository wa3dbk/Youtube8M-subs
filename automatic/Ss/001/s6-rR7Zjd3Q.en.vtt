it's much less lean angle and lower

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.820 
it's much less lean angle and lower
speed<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:50.870> you're<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:52.580> know<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:53.170> think<00:01:54.170> you

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.490 
then you know you're just feeling the
tires<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> slide<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.900> grip<00:02:12.170> and

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
tires and the slide and the grip and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.840 
tires and the slide and the grip and
like<00:02:12.740> all<00:02:12.920> around<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.250> care<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> good

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
like all around the care so it's a good

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.190 
like all around the care so it's a good
corner<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.360> where<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.570> can<00:02:14.690> kind<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.990> really

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
corner here where you can kind of really

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.810 
corner here where you can kind of really
kind<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.890> get<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.100> there<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.459> can<00:02:16.610> lean

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
kind of get in there and you can lean

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.400 
kind of get in there and you can lean
over<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.060> little<00:02:17.180> more<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.810> try<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.020> go<00:02:18.200> more

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
over a little more and try to go more

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.470 
over a little more and try to go more
and<00:02:18.470> more<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.490> kind<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.060> get<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.300> over

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and more and you kind of get it over

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.250 
and more and you kind of get it over
there<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.750> know<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.020> know<00:02:21.140> you're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
there you know and you know you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
there you know and you know you're
getting<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.500> tire<00:02:21.680> scrubbed<00:02:22.070> really<00:02:22.280> good<00:02:22.490> a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
getting a tire scrubbed really good a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670 
getting a tire scrubbed really good a
lot<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.360> other<00:02:23.450> corners<00:02:23.870> they're<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.410> short

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
lot of other corners they're so short

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.930 
lot of other corners they're so short
and<00:02:24.980> quick<00:02:25.130> you're<00:02:25.430> just<00:02:25.550> in<00:02:25.640> there<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:25.910> a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and quick you're just in there for a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.970 
and quick you're just in there for a
minute<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.900> like<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.590> hard<00:02:27.709> to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
minute and then it's like it's hard to

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.100 
minute and then it's like it's hard to
really<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.760> over<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.570> know<00:02:29.660> unless<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
really get it over you know unless the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.410 
really get it over you know unless the
traction<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.070> really<00:02:31.340> good<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:31.790> place<00:02:32.209> is

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
traction is really good just place is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.050 
traction is really good just place is
tough<00:02:32.600> because<00:02:32.810> there's<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.290> many<00:02:33.350> different

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
tough because there's so many different

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.690 
tough because there's so many different
the<00:02:35.060> surface<00:02:35.750> changes<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.410> much<00:02:36.590> yeah<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.400> mean

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the surface changes so much yeah I mean

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.020 
the surface changes so much yeah I mean
patches<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.330> sealer<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.870> paint<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.410> stuff

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
patches and sealer and paint and stuff

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.300 
patches and sealer and paint and stuff
it's<00:02:41.030> really<00:02:41.270> tough<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.100> know<00:02:43.190> we

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
not so much in the rain usually in the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.870 
not so much in the rain usually in the
rain<00:02:57.140> when<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.470> goes<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.220> goes<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.640> fast

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
rain when it goes that it goes so fast

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.970 
rain when it goes that it goes so fast
but<00:02:59.360> if<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.080> have<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.290> bike<00:03:00.440> sit<00:03:00.650> upright<00:03:00.830> in

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
but if you have to bike sit upright in

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.490 
but if you have to bike sit upright in
the<00:03:01.130> bike<00:03:01.310> kind<00:03:01.550> of<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:02.480> can<00:03:02.660> feel<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.230> slide

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
the bike kind of you can feel the slide

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.620 
the bike kind of you can feel the slide
and<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.800> squirming<00:03:04.220> around<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.540> know

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
and the squirming around and you know

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.820 
and the squirming around and you know
you<00:03:05.690> can<00:03:05.870> kind<00:03:06.019> of<00:03:06.110> push<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.530> little<00:03:06.590> bit

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
you can kind of push it a little bit

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.430 
you can kind of push it a little bit
slide<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.459> but<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:08.660> depends<00:03:08.989> on<00:03:09.080> what's<00:03:09.260> kind

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
slide it but just depends on what's kind

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.690 
slide it but just depends on what's kind
of<00:03:09.530> set<00:03:09.650> up<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.830> got<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.070> bike<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:10.370> got<00:03:10.430> if

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
of set up you got the bike it's got if

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.920 
of set up you got the bike it's got if
you're<00:03:10.790> trying<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.060> ride<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> dry<00:03:11.450> set<00:03:11.690> up<00:03:11.810> in

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
you're trying to ride a dry set up in

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.470 
you're trying to ride a dry set up in
the<00:03:12.050> wet<00:03:12.260> then<00:03:13.250> usually<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.670> gets<00:03:13.760> real<00:03:13.970> snappy

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
the wet then usually it gets real snappy

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.300 
the wet then usually it gets real snappy
and<00:03:14.630> goes<00:03:14.780> fast<00:03:15.050> if<00:03:15.350> something<00:03:15.769> happens<00:03:16.100> and

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
and goes fast if something happens and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.540 
and goes fast if something happens and
you<00:03:17.209> soften<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.930> makes<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.550> more

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
you soften it up it makes a more

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.120 
you soften it up it makes a more
progressive<00:03:19.930> slower<00:03:20.930> reacting<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.890> stuff

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
progressive slower reacting and stuff

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.610 
progressive slower reacting and stuff
like<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.489> helps<00:03:23.120> keep<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.450> tires

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
like that helps keep the tires

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.220 
like that helps keep the tires
in<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.580> Superbike<00:03:25.940> race<00:03:26.239> were<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.050> running

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
because the conditions were kind of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.650 
because the conditions were kind of
sketchy<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:31.819> pretty<00:03:32.030> much<00:03:32.120> everybody<00:03:32.569> was
