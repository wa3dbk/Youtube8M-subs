00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 this is all I have left 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.090
 little place is all that remains of my 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 I'm just here waiting for everything 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.920
 started a couple of days ago I started the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.619
 partner and dance we were resting 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.170
 in downtown pokemon city I like 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.779
 at that time I wanted to address 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.090
 directly to city puntana I went to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.939
 be able to compete in the pokemon gym 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 but my dance was very restless to go 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.949
 to the crown mountain I had never seen it like that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.500
 it had always been cold and calculating 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.390
 like all of its kind but a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 coach who saw the scene that rode 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 alive and he told me I think your friend wants 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.399
 visit your home your home I was something 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 confused because I did not know where there was 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.829
 I lived my dance since my father told me 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 I had birthday gift so 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.840
 I really had no idea where 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 I could live then very kindly 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.629
 he told me look they live in the caves 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 of Monte Corona, you should do it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.710
 happy and take her to visit her home 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.690
 then I thanked him for the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.020
 information and I set out to take to today 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.240
 goes the sugar on the way I felt a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.250
 chill in my body but I did not give 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 importance because it was a very cold place 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.840
 maybe that's the fact that there was not 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.060
 seen another pokemon or person from 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.550
 It's been a while while we 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.740
 we went deeper into the caves I could see 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.200
 that I saw dance was marking some rocks 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.180
 with its claws I assumed it was for no 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.810
 get lost so I did not give much 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.899
 importance later while walking 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.509
 I found among the rocks an ultra bullet 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.330
 I was happy because these bullets are very 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.789
 faces after continuing to walk 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.000
 I found more valuable objects for me 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.360
 adventure like berries potions objects 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.179
 equipment and more later I knew where 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.640
 it came all between some rocks of 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.679
 agreement was a backpack the backpack 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.050
 it was broken and that's where things came from 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.729
 that I found, I assumed that some pokemon 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.830
 as goal but had gone after the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.170
 owner of the backpack to take out 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.429
 food and he got scared and ran away leaving 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.140
 a trail in its path 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.120
 after that he saw that he was following him 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.430
 I was leaving a trail and decided 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.500
 abandon your backpack 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.629
 after laughing a little while imagining 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.909
 a person being attacked by a goal 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.129
 but I decided to follow today and dance that 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.359
 He seemed increasingly anxious 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.639
 something like being near your home 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.250
 after walking a little bit more we were 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.409
 in a dead end I said to 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.719
 while that what was happening as he 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.180
 do not usually get lost then I turned around 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:43.870
 instinctively I saw a lot of smithers 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.419
 looking at me with evil faces before 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.950
 I can not even say a word 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:51.700
 hit my head and I fell to the ground 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.470
 unconscious when I woke up I noticed that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.689
 I was in a cavern bigger than 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.750
 before and more people were with me 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.269
 we were all tied and listened 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.269
 screams of pain of a person then the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.219
 shouts suddenly ceased a group of 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.919
 smithers came and took a 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.760
 person he cried and said no please 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.010
 I do not 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.629
 but they will tear it and take it to 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.970
 strength 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.250
 I was terrified but I took strength and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.500
 I asked another person what it is that 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.540
 It happened he answered me that he had arrived 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.700
 our time that smith else we 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.860
 they would take to the other side of that cave not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.900
 We would never return that in a few 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.450
 moments would be heard the cries of 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.190
 pain and effectively after a 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.459
 moment the screams started and 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.620
 they quickly ceased at that moment 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.349
 the smith came out yes they looked at us with 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.470
 those faces or ribles before starting at 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.200
 deeper in that cave in that 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.139
 now he had to think of something they do not 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.870
 I wanted to die in that place all 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:57.170
 others were only resigned but I did not 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.269
 I was willing to escape in a 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.430
 moment I started rubbing myself against the 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.799
 walls of the cave to wear the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.200
 rope that held me after a 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.569
 I managed to get away and helped the others 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.180
 our belts had been removed 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.790
 with our remaining pokémons and such 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.090
 without them we were helpless but 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.690
 not dead so we quickly dealt with 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.880
 to find 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.190
 the exit we walk for a good time 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.480
 for the caves but we always finished 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.790
 in the same place 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.340
 we only had to review the place by 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.580
 where the Smiths had left when 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.920
 we passed I almost vomited candles many 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.190
 others cried others just 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.380
 they were stupefied in that room 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.510
 there were the corpses devoured from the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.370
 people that they took all 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.040
 they had an expression of pain in their 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.180
 faces then I deduced that they were 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.950
 alive when they began to devour the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.170
 we quickly left that camera of 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.120
 horror to be free we walk 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.340
 for several hours on that road 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.090
 after a time to take a 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.130
 respite 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.530
 I could see something engraved on the stones 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.320
 it was the marks that my dance was 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.780
 doing then maybe we would have a 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.780
 opportunity if we could decipher what 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.880
 they wanted to say those things after 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.670
 think about it a little they started to listen 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.740
 footsteps and grunts seemed like the smiths 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.470
 celso had discovered our life 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.160
 so we decided to get going 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.170
 faster now 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.360
 we knew they were very pokémons 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.850
 fast after running for that 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.790
 endless cave I separated from the group 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.860
 together with another boy at that time 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.780
 I found my wii by I was very 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.240
 excited because I thought that he 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.700
 would protect from those pokémons but 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.830
 so when trying to approach me he 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.350
 he accused with his claws I felt a pain 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.320
 unbearable in the chest and fell to the floor 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.720
 the boy kicked wii dance and told me that 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.970
 run as fast as you could 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.940
 he would resist everything possible so that 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.460
 I escaped I ran out covering 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.230
 me the place where I was bleeding 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.060
 after running and running I hid in 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.100
 a small opening in the cave 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.560
 hoping that darkness does not 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.270
 you will find when you are there I heard the 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.880
 cries of pain and death of the boys 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.340
 that accompanied me knew that none of 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.370
 they would come out alive from here and neither would I 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.890
 in this opening I would be sure of them 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.710
 but I would also find late death 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.960
 or early in this moment it only remains for me 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.310
 die either because will bayle me 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.529
 and I find bowling by 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.839
 hemorrhage that I have in the abdomen but 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.759
 At least for me, bleeding to death is 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:35.879
 paradise compared to what they 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.399
 wait for the others at this time 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:41.099
 I hear small footsteps I know it's the 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:43.799
 I know it 's alive and I hear it coming towards 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.869
 here but that does not matter anymore it 's lost 

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:48.869
 a lot of blood and I feel the body very 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:51.809
 heavy now just close your eyes and 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:54.919
 I'll wait until everything ends up waiting for the 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.919
 warm embrace of death
