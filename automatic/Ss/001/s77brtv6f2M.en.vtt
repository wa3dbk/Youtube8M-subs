and fish finder as well and then we go

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.059 
and fish finder as well and then we go
to<00:01:39.149> Suzuki<00:01:39.569> gauges<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.619> addition<00:01:41.009> to

to Suzuki gauges here in addition to

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.419 
to Suzuki gauges here in addition to

clean history and like I said it's got

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.099 
clean history and like I said it's got
less<00:01:50.069> than<00:01:50.100> 20<00:01:50.520> hours<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.969> clock<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.450> it's

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
less than 20 hours on the clock so it's

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.819 
less than 20 hours on the clock so it's
um<00:01:52.459> it's<00:01:53.459> just<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.880> Briony<00:01:54.469> all<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.649> switch

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
um it's just like Briony all the switch

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.209 
um it's just like Briony all the switch

obviously<00:01:56.609> working<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.999> well

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.960 

coming<00:02:18.590> forward<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.160> from<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.610> helm

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
coming forward then from the helm

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.920 
coming forward then from the helm
position<00:02:20.390> we're<00:02:21.380> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.590> steps<00:02:22.660> under<00:02:23.660> this

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
position we're going to steps under this

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.990 
position we're going to steps under this
forward<00:02:24.230> cabin<00:02:24.560> area<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.430> we've<00:02:25.550> got<00:02:25.670> effects

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
forward cabin area so we've got effects
