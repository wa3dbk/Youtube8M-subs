00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.730
 and we went on a private jet 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.280
 directly to the end with 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:22.439
 Interesting 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:24.570
 and very good guys to this new video 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.769
 that tells us a moment we have done 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 most complete in china 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
 obviously new and to china we have not 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 used one of these pages there 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 a lot to buy items I guess 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 that you will know most but good 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 under which I'm not going to leave the link 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 to the different products that we are going to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.190
 see below and good as I say there 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.750
 a lot of pages and then our 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.520
 pages is that then buy a lot of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 articles without leaving a price 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.180
 disproportionate not since they are prices then 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.329
 quite cheap, most of them are going 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.309
 to be between dollars three dollars 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.660
 so we 're not going to start knowing the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.760
 products that we have purchased the expenses 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440
 they are nonsense but good those that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.360
 they are interesting and as I tell you by the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 price that you have then they give 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.880
 we start with the self and good steak 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.160
 theory and a lot of desire to have this 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.990
 stick not the truth is that already enough 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.630
 time loving it and good I found it to 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.460
 very good price in this case has 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.050
 cost six dollars is pretty good 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.050
 and well it would be extendable 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 to the screen but hey there's the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.950
 seeing that it is quite long we are going to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.079
 close it so you can see it 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.390
 and well certainly this is a 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.729
 caprichito that is the same model and much 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.079
 use but good as I said have it and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.450
 well here we can place any 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.070
 smartphone what we want here is this 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 is adaptable and what's good about this what 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.820
 he liked it is not going by bluetooth 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.280
 therefore we spend extra battery 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.920
 with at the time of making the photo not simple 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.509
 we connect this in the jack of our 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.829
 smartphone and with this button 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.960
 we would take the pictures and the truth that 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.939
 it's pretty good we're going to go through the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.240
 next gadget also very related 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.240
 with this and it would be this kind of command 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.220
 Well, it would be like not using it 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.539
 how to use with the stick or just 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.099
 to take the pictures directly worth 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.450
 simply this will be bluetooth 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.619
 is a bluetooth control in which here 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.619
 we are going to put the batteries 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 do not 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.599
 there we would have it and well what 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.129
 synchronize produces cones smartphones 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 and instead of having to give the 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.459
 screen is going to make the photo simply 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.319
 we touch the button to take the picture and 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.730
 to repeat it because we play this name 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.200
 also another article because it was a 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.209
 little jet for some what is good is 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 that we could have here on the keychain and 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 this way we would not lose it and it has 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.720
 cost two dollars we leave it here and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.549
 we follow the third article we will see 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.620
 that this cable is also much more 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.269
 simply a microusb cable of a 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.030
 subway but it caught my attention 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.260
 since good was flat and the good thing about 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.840
 plants is that apart from not being 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.250
 roll up because they seem pretty 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.709
 Pretty smarter than a few rounds 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.630
 that are going to take this away would have a meter 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.940
 long and good is pretty good 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.129
 here we have the microusb connector and here 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.230
 the usb can not you can connect it to 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.120
 computer to our charger and how 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.940
 We want to be worth there would be connected 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.910
 and nothing is quite good the price is 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.060
 from $ 1.47 so pretty 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.610
 economic also now the next 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.140
 product is this otg cable vale is what 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.000
 that everyone will know what a cable is ok 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.950
 it would simply be a 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.050
 to connect it to our smartphone or 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.060
 tablets and that way it will connect some 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.180
 external peripheral is worth in this case 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.850
 it would be from us, we connect it here 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.250
 to the micro usb and here for example then 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.480
 we could connect or a mouse that 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.580
 it would not make much good sense either 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.190
 depends on in each case and especially 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.690
 It would be the futility that I would most 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.000
 would use would be to connect a 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.390
 pendrive is good enough is very 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.490
 kid and the price is 1.98 as 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.740
 has commented the following product that 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.330
 let's see is this here what are you 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.070
 thinking about what the fuck is this are not 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.810
 slingshot what is this so good 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.760
 it would simply be a double jack connector 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.950
 and how good it sends many times 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.080
 well in travel moby or anything and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 I go with someone and I want for example 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.260
 share the music or listen to the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.450
 two the same music or see the two the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.250
 same movie and what alters what 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.900
 ended up having to do is that 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.550
 we have to put on a headset every 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.370
 one instead of being able to connect each one 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.890
 each helmet the two to the device not 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.959
 I already have others double since it allows that 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.850
 function and I always have them at home 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.860
 less when I need them when 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.970
 I need is that they disappear and then 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.130
 I saw this that would have 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.900
 to wear it as a keychain since good 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.100
 how to be seeing here the ring is very 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.320
 functional not since you're going to have it 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.790
 always here by hand and as you see here 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.920
 we simply connect it 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.630
 the yang of our tablet smartphone 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760
 where we want and here we could connect 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.650
 in two atria at a time the truth that 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.240
 it's pretty good, let me do what I 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.070
 he liked most of all has been the fact 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.980
 that we are going to take him to here always 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.050
 its price is 335 dollars 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.030
 the next product would be this cable 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.060
 that we have here and it would simply be a 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.920
 vga and hdmi adapter I have a 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.090
 portable that is like that kid and good 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.860
 Well we are well then for 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.960
 take it anywhere not have to 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.910
 carry the other one that is heavier and 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.400
 it's bigger and but the problem of 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.990
 another is that he does not have hdmi no then 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.730
 then if I go anywhere or I want 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.560
 take it to the living room or whatever and I want to 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.030
 connect it to the television because no 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.310
 I would have the possibility to connect 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.200
 via hdmi and this cable as 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.840
 It would be so easy, not because we connect 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.700
 the vga in the for my laptop and the hdmi 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.010
 on television and I would not be either 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.840
 has much more to explain and good 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.420
 We now go to the last product we have 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.700
 bought in China and well it is this 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.080
 antenna here and good up to the 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.270
 would have a double functionality 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.130
 Price is 390 so either if 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.330
 others came with $ 90 all 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.169
 prices of the products that we have said 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.189
 it's in dollars if we pass it to euros 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.289
 more or less than euros and you pass it to pesos 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.389
 Mexicans, well, it will be more, I do not know, no, 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.949
 I know how the change started 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.840
 citizens I have no idea but good 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.449
 it is basically in US dollar 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.550
 Well, more or less, or you're a little laras the idea 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.110
 so once it costs 390 dollars and 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.639
 would have a double functionality like 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.460
 was commenting generates the possibility 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.139
 to connect it to our computer and 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.389
 this way then pineapple we would make the signal 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.009
 of more wifi no more distance if by 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.319
 example we want to do it in one more radius 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.419
 the round not a flat more generic 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.460
 we would place it up and 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.409
 caught and has thus put more in the round not 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.650
 if for example we want to catch more for 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.710
 we would point it out for the window and 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.629
 zarco we would take the signals of others 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.520
 buildings for example and then the other 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.680
 functionality is that we can connect it 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.779
 in our router that sure that your 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.430
 router has a usb port and this way 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.139
 we would be expanding the signal of 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.180
 our router if for example we 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.680
 we go down from home or we are in the 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.569
 another tip of the house and we'll get it right 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.430
 well the connection with this antenna as he 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.409
 in principle yes that should reach us 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.180
 well the connection to get better the 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.590
 connection and good guys these would be the 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.820
 purchases we have made 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.470
 in china we see I counted on 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.360
 descriptions to get is when I'm going 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.430
 to leave the link to different products 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.170
 that we have bought and I like how 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.600
 comments choose which has put an 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.770
 been the gadget that you liked the most and 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 in the same way I would like 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.190
 put upon my work is that if what 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.140
 you want it to become a section 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.390
 from time to time then once every two 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.190
 months once every three months then with 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.780
 three different gadgets on some page 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.280
 china of these as for example here 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.250
 something varied, buy some cables 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.860
 an antenna a gadget that is more the and 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.990
 pretty good being critical to things 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.400
 varied and at a price where it is fulfilled and 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.990
 you want it to become the section 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.640
 of the channel not that as I said then a 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.140
 every two months or so I bought a 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.180
 certain amount of non-style products 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.650
 this so nothing like I said in 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.060

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.830
