00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
such yes since my fan base is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.859 
such yes since my fan base is
international<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.119> really<00:02:05.390> thought<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.600> was<00:02:05.810> a

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
international I really thought it was a

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.100 
international I really thought it was a
great<00:02:06.799> idea<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.189> go<00:02:07.789> with<00:02:07.969> them<00:02:08.180> and<00:02:08.390> going

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
great idea to go with them and going

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.589 
great idea to go with them and going
there<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.500> visit<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.920> programs<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.849> is<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.569> is

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
there and visit the programs it is it is

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.869 
there and visit the programs it is it is
so<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:12.530> different<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.670> be

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
so it is so different to actually be

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.280 
so it is so different to actually be
there<00:02:14.120> because<00:02:14.330> you

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
there because you
