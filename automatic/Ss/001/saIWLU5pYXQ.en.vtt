00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 it is difficult for difficult exercise 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 to improve but he wants to help 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.949
 because it was a full week of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 vacation a week that I went to the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.650

 what to like and enjoy 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 much of our beautiful culture for 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 keep talking about the topic was a week 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 completely vacation a week 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.460
 of coca-cola covered where with the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.129
 pixelated with my face 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 the interior of the country is like all this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.079
 what is past 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 I am no longer accepted because we are 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 vacation but for that there is also no 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.480
 to go crazy on vacations that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.159
 have a certain pause or guidelines govern and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.720
 everything a little bit more always 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.850
 generally it does not matter but 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.450
 we are going to exercise so that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 do not completely miss your physique 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.080
 so the truth is that I did a lot 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.429
 exercise and amuda was a lot can not be 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.480
 say that many but for those to 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.700
 be on vacation and be the truth that 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.130
 of very few sit-ups and it 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.690
 a month worked shoulder to 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.030

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.810
 little in the area 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.300
