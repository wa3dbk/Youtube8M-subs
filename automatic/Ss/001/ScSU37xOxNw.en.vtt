00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
bit of the body in which I do the same

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.549 
bit of the body in which I do the same
thing<00:00:07.650> here's<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:10.450> back<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:10.719> the<00:00:11.139> front<00:00:11.289> of

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
thing here's the back and the front of

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.699 
thing here's the back and the front of
the<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.519> top<00:00:12.759> of<00:00:12.789> the<00:00:13.059> body<00:00:13.269> so<00:00:14.230> this<00:00:14.379> is<00:00:14.559> the

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
the the top of the body so this is the

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.710 
the the top of the body so this is the
part<00:00:14.919> that<00:00:15.129> gets<00:00:15.309> glued<00:00:15.699> on<00:00:15.909> to<00:00:16.090> the<00:00:16.180> neck<00:00:16.420> so

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
part that gets glued on to the neck so

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.940 
part that gets glued on to the neck so
I'm<00:00:16.840> not<00:00:17.020> going<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:17.230> do<00:00:17.320> anything<00:00:17.560> with<00:00:17.830> this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
I'm not going to do anything with this

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.010 
I'm not going to do anything with this
surface<00:00:18.400> but<00:00:18.910> this<00:00:19.120> whole<00:00:19.330> area<00:00:19.720> is<00:00:19.750> going<00:00:19.960> to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
surface but this whole area is going to

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:49.360 
surface but this whole area is going to
be<00:00:20.200> rounded

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.470 

now<00:00:50.810> on<00:00:51.810> this<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.790> area<00:00:54.090> where<00:00:54.270> your

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
now on this this is the area where your

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.260 
now on this this is the area where your
arm<00:00:54.720> goes<00:00:55.110> over<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.830> play<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.250> strings<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.210> I'm

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
arm goes over to play the strings so I'm

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.120 
arm goes over to play the strings so I'm
going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.450> take<00:00:57.630> more<00:00:58.080> material<00:00:58.650> I<00:00:58.770> want<00:00:58.920> I

want a long wedge area I want a lot more
material<00:01:03.330> off<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:04.129> I<00:01:06.619> view<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.190> I<00:01:08.220> do

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
material off of here I view the way I do

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
material off of here I view the way I do
these<00:01:08.940> angles<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.780> don't<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> fixed<00:01:11.250> shape

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
these angles I don't use a fixed shape

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
these angles I don't use a fixed shape
like<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.570> people<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.050> shaper<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
like some people use a shaper or a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.200 
like some people use a shaper or a
router<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:15.060> route<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.710> fixed<00:01:16.710> radius<00:01:17.210> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
router to route a fixed radius that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.780 
router to route a fixed radius that
almost<00:01:18.510> feels<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.560> love<00:01:19.800> driving<00:01:20.580> on

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
almost feels like like I love driving on

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.790 
almost feels like like I love driving on
a<00:01:20.820> road<00:01:21.060> where<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.810> around<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.259> sharp<00:01:22.440> Bank

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
a road where you go around a sharp Bank

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.710 
a road where you go around a sharp Bank
and<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:23.940> sudden<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.330> realize<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and all of a sudden you realize that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.900 
and all of a sudden you realize that
that<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.500> banked<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.160> particular<00:01:26.670> angle

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
that it's banked at a particular angle

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.020 
that it's banked at a particular angle
and<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.450> car<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.229> hugs<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.770> road<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.880> me

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and your car just hugs the road to me

and your car just hugs the road to me
the<00:01:30.479> grace<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.410> lines<00:01:31.649> of<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> guitar<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
the grace of the lines of a guitar you

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.880 
the grace of the lines of a guitar you
don't<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> same<00:01:33.990> radius<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.710> whole

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
don't want the same radius the whole

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.800 
don't want the same radius the whole
distance<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.670> me<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:36.000> sudden<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> says

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
distance to me all sudden it says

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.529 
distance to me all sudden it says
mechanical<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.710> says<00:01:37.890> machine<00:01:38.310> did<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:38.789> to

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
mechanical it says machine did that to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.050 
mechanical it says machine did that to
me<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.899> want<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.649> want<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.430> contours<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
me I want the I want the contours to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200 
me I want the I want the contours to
gradually<00:01:42.780> change<00:01:43.140> everywhere<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.550> figure

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
gradually change everywhere to figure

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.480 
gradually change everywhere to figure
out<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.539> grace<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.950> lines<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
out the grace of the the lines of the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.219 
out the grace of the the lines of the
guitar<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.240> why<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.660> all<00:01:48.780> by<00:01:48.960> hand

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
guitar so that's why I do it all by hand

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.070 
guitar so that's why I do it all by hand
so<00:01:50.160> I'll<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.729> some<00:01:51.060> cuts<00:01:51.690> here<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
so I'll just do some cuts here and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.639 
so I'll just do some cuts here and
you'll<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.550> build<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
you'll see that I can build in this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:31.320 
you'll see that I can build in this
wedge<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.100> arm

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.020 

you

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.149 

getting<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.269> more<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.159> back

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
getting a little more there on the back

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.229 
getting a little more there on the back
this<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.849> where<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.330> fits<00:02:42.690> into<00:02:43.230> your<00:02:43.260> side

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
this is where it fits into your side

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.050 
this is where it fits into your side
and<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:46.019> don't<00:02:46.409> want<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> sharp<00:02:46.980> edge<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.610> if

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and you don't want a sharp edge and if

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.399 
and you don't want a sharp edge and if
you've<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> little<00:02:48.690> bit<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> extra<00:02:49.170> weight

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
you've got a little bit of extra weight

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.240 
you've got a little bit of extra weight
which<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:49.890> all<00:02:50.040> seem<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:51.569> do<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.440> steeper

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
which we all seem to I do a steeper

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.460 
which we all seem to I do a steeper
contour<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.299> just<00:02:54.540> sort<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
contour in here just sort of so that the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:26.260 
contour in here just sort of so that the
guitar<00:02:56.040> hugs<00:02:56.819> your<00:02:57.209> stomach

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.360 

so<00:03:27.270> I've<00:03:27.420> taken<00:03:27.990> off<00:03:28.230> more<00:03:28.500> material<00:03:29.070> there

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so I've taken off more material there

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.460 
so I've taken off more material there
and<00:03:29.610> I'll<00:03:30.030> keep<00:03:30.240> working<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.110> little<00:03:31.230> bit

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and I'll keep working on it a little bit

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.670 
and I'll keep working on it a little bit
at<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.740> time<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:32.390> rough<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.600> out<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.110> it'll

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
at a time to rough that out and it'll

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.680 
at a time to rough that out and it'll

know<00:03:39.720> work<00:03:40.080> away<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.700> just<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.060> quick

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
know work away and this is just a quick

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.090 
know work away and this is just a quick
quick<00:03:43.250> removal<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.900> what<00:03:46.590> I'll<00:03:46.710> do<00:03:46.890> I'll

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
quick removal and now what I'll do I'll

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.640 
quick removal and now what I'll do I'll
let's<00:03:47.520> jump<00:03:47.880> ahead<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.480> we'll<00:03:48.690> go<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.050> where<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
let's jump ahead and we'll go to where I

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.240 
let's jump ahead and we'll go to where I
use<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.700> rasp<00:03:50.930> because<00:03:51.930> clearly<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.830> that

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
use the rasp because clearly that that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.880 
use the rasp because clearly that that
looks<00:03:53.460> ugly<00:03:53.610> at<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.150> point<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.810> mean<00:03:55.710> it<00:03:55.770> looks

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
looks ugly at this point I mean it looks

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.070 
looks ugly at this point I mean it looks
fine<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.160> me<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.820> know<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.480> because<00:03:57.600> I'm

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
fine to me but I know it's because I'm

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
fine to me but I know it's because I'm
going<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.320> come<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.710> even<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.400> high<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.910> low

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
going to come in even the high and low

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.600 
going to come in even the high and low
points<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.720> put<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.350> really<00:04:01.620> nice<00:04:01.800> contour<00:04:02.370> on

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
points and put a really nice contour on

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.930 
points and put a really nice contour on
that<00:04:02.820> so<00:04:03.300> we'll<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.600> next
