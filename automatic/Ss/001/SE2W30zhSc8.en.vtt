00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 chain3 the television more environment 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.290
 Good Morning 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.710
 very good very happy and I bring you a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.360
 kids joke to see this is a man 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 well with a banana and you tell me do not be 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.090
 come here the banana is talking 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.090
 and he says he wants what he's talking about 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:32.329
 there are two ways to sew the straws 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.120
 we can put them from cold water 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.899
 well like that way and the other way 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.729
 is to put them to bake the two ways 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.710
 They are very good for me. I always like them 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.929
 more bake 'the voice' because mÃ³nica not 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.460
 they absorb absolutely no water 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.559
 then we can chop with a fork 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.059
 so they go straight to the oven like that 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.189
 I also taste the baked potato 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.379
 much more like they are going to bake 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.899
 350 degree average temperature 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.239

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.619
