00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
didn't work so I had leftover agave mask
on<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:39.930> finger<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.530> went<00:01:40.829> ahead<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
on my finger and I just went ahead and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.340 
on my finger and I just went ahead and
applied<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.750> figured<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> lip

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
applied it I just figured it's a lip

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.810 
applied it I just figured it's a lip
mask<00:01:43.560> what's<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> worst<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.759> happen

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
mask what's the worst that could happen

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.510 
mask what's the worst that could happen
so<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:46.200> did<00:01:46.500> exactly<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.130> doing<00:01:47.369> now

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so I did exactly what I'm doing now

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840 
so I did exactly what I'm doing now
applying<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:49.320> both<00:01:49.590> sides<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.369> again<00:01:50.729> I'm

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
applying it on both sides and again I'm

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
applying it on both sides and again I'm
doing<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.149> overnight<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.470> apply

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
doing this overnight and I also apply

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
doing this overnight and I also apply
this<00:01:53.189> wherever<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> dry<00:01:54.210> patch<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:55.049> you

like I did and if they give you a
generous<00:02:26.210> sample<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:26.720> even<00:02:26.960> better<00:02:27.140> cuz<00:02:27.440> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
generous sample it's even better cuz it

a<00:02:29.990> regular<00:02:30.020> sized<00:02:30.560> sample<00:02:31.010> would<00:02:31.190> work<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.610> you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730
