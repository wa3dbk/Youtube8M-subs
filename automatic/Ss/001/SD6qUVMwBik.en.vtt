00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.080 
think about the new show or if you saw
any<00:03:12.989> more<00:03:13.200> similarities<00:03:13.860> or<00:03:13.890> differences<00:03:14.340> but

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
I do have to point out that the twilight

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.580 
I do have to point out that the twilight
saga<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:18.150> probably<00:03:18.720> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.049> over<00:03:19.410> pretty

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
saga is probably going to be over pretty

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.080 
saga is probably going to be over pretty
soon<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.100> even<00:03:20.370> though<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.700> watch<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
soon and even though you can watch the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.699 
soon and even though you can watch the
movies<00:03:21.360> over<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.810> over<00:03:22.049> again<00:03:22.290> we're

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
movies over and over again we're

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.509 
movies over and over again we're
probably<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:23.130> going<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.430> getting

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
probably not going to be getting

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.580 
probably not going to be getting
something<00:03:23.880> fresh<00:03:24.330> after<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> next<00:03:25.260> year<00:03:25.470> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
something fresh after the next year and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.620 
something fresh after the next year and
a<00:03:25.620> half<00:03:25.799> or<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.820> maybe<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> Vampire

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
a half or so so maybe the Vampire

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.990 
a half or so so maybe the Vampire
Diaries<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:28.380> kind<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.650> fill<00:03:29.280> your<00:03:29.580> thirst
