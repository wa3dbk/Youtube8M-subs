let's<00:00:01.770> look<00:00:01.979> at<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.370> scenario<00:00:03.529> white<00:00:04.529> low

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
let's look at this scenario white low

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.280 
let's look at this scenario white low

double<00:00:14.490> honeys<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:15.630> should<00:00:15.900> black<00:00:16.139> play

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.670 

beginner<00:00:19.800> may<00:00:20.189> play<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.420> atari's<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
beginner may play like this atari's and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.720 
beginner may play like this atari's and
not<00:00:23.460> hurries<00:00:24.529> now<00:00:25.529> y<00:00:26.460> dot<00:00:26.699> our<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
not hurries now y dot our is here and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
not hurries now y dot our is here and
that<00:00:29.730> hurries<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.990> black<00:00:31.260> stone<00:00:32.930> this<00:00:33.930> black

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that hurries this black stone this black

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.850 
that hurries this black stone this black
stone<00:00:34.620> cannot<00:00:35.040> escape<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:36.500> white<00:00:37.500> can

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
stone cannot escape because white can

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.319 
stone cannot escape because white can
ladder<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> result<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.660> this

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
ladder it so with the result like this

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
ladder it so with the result like this
it's<00:00:45.329> clearly<00:00:45.719> better<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.829> white<00:00:47.100> because

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it's clearly better for white because

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.930 
it's clearly better for white because
black<00:00:48.180> only<00:00:48.450> gets<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.960> tiny<00:00:49.230> corner<00:00:50.219> territory

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
black only gets a tiny corner territory

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.010 
black only gets a tiny corner territory
and<00:00:51.210> white<00:00:51.629> gets<00:00:51.930> outside<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.960> good

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and white gets outside this is not good

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.479 
and white gets outside this is not good
for<00:00:55.260> black<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:59.960> how<00:01:00.960> about<00:01:01.199> black<00:01:01.590> connects

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
for black a how about black connects

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.370 
for black a how about black connects
here<00:01:02.809> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.799> too<00:01:05.040> soft<00:01:05.400> because

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
here this is a bit too soft because

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.359 
here this is a bit too soft because
white<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.590> make<00:01:07.860> Tiger<00:01:08.189> mouth<00:01:09.350> blackanese

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
white would make Tiger mouth blackanese

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.120 
white would make Tiger mouth blackanese
white<00:01:11.369> honey's<00:01:12.409> with<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> shape<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
white honey's with a shape like this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.749 
white honey's with a shape like this
this<00:01:15.060> white<00:01:15.509> group<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:17.450> alive<00:01:18.450> already<00:01:19.759> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
this white group is alive already so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
this white group is alive already so
it's<00:01:21.420> harder<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.900> black<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.500> attack<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's harder for black to attack this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's harder for black to attack this
white<00:01:23.610> group<00:01:23.850> anymore<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.250> for

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
white group anymore this is not good for

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.270 
white group anymore this is not good for
black<00:01:26.970> either

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.790 

now<00:01:32.280> black<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.970> Atari<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.530> side<00:01:36.800> white

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
now black can Atari from this side white

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.840 
now black can Atari from this side white
connects<00:01:39.140> if<00:01:40.140> black<00:01:40.830> connects<00:01:43.100> wide<00:01:44.100> connect

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
connects if black connects wide connect

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
connects if black connects wide connect
you<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:46.310> black<00:01:47.310> extends<00:01:48.470> white<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.800> either

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you now black extends white can either

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.280 
you now black extends white can either
play<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.170> jump<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:53.960> or<00:01:54.960> extend<00:01:55.560> here

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
play this one jump here or extend here

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.900 
play this one jump here or extend here
if<00:01:58.290> black<00:01:58.740> anaise<00:01:59.990> white<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.260> honey<00:02:01.910> notice

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
if black anaise white can honey notice

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.900 
if black anaise white can honey notice
black<00:02:03.300> cannot<00:02:03.750> cut<00:02:04.080> here<00:02:05.630> if<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.580> why<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.640> can

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
black cannot cut here if so why it can

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.940 
black cannot cut here if so why it can
cut<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.860> now<00:02:11.209> if<00:02:12.500> black<00:02:13.500> Ataris<00:02:15.650> why<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.709> has

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
cut here now if black Ataris why it has

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.430 
cut here now if black Ataris why it has
this<00:02:17.280> double<00:02:17.820> Ataris<00:02:20.630> if<00:02:21.630> black<00:02:22.020> connects

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
this double Ataris if black connects

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.100 
this double Ataris if black connects
white<00:02:23.280> catches<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:24.000> stone<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
white catches this stone so this is

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.630 
white catches this stone so this is
horrible<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.680> black<00:02:27.739> now<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:28.920> black<00:02:29.250> take

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
horrible for black now if black take

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.420 
horrible for black now if black take
care<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.270> cutting<00:02:30.780> point<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.830> white<00:02:32.070> can

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
care of this cutting point the white can

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.920 
care of this cutting point the white can
extend<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.090> gets<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.870> big<00:02:34.200> corner<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> at<00:02:36.750> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
extend and gets a big corner so at this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.390 
extend and gets a big corner so at this
point<00:02:37.260> black<00:02:37.890> cannot<00:02:38.370> cut<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.950> can<00:02:41.070> probably

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
point black cannot cut you can probably

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.350 
point black cannot cut you can probably
just<00:02:41.670> play<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.110> result<00:02:46.620> again<00:02:47.430> it's

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
just play this so this result again it's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.780 
just play this so this result again it's
very<00:02:48.600> good<00:02:48.750> for<00:02:48.930> white<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.459> black

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
very good for white because this black

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.420 
very good for white because this black
stone<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:52.010> weakened<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.510> black<00:02:54.510> white<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.170> in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
stone is weakened and black white is in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.250 
stone is weakened and black white is in
very<00:02:56.430> good<00:02:56.610> shape

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.380 

so<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.560> strong<00:03:04.100> move<00:03:04.310> here<00:03:05.000> for<00:03:05.180> black<00:03:06.490> is<00:03:07.490> to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
so the strong move here for black is to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.850 
so the strong move here for black is to
cut<00:03:08.660> here<00:03:10.120> now<00:03:11.120> why<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.480> has<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.930> cut<00:03:12.140> black

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
cut here now why it has to cut black

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.940 
cut here now why it has to cut black
turns<00:03:13.540> white<00:03:14.540> connects<00:03:15.910> black<00:03:16.910> her<00:03:17.180> neighs

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
turns white connects black her neighs

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.660 
turns white connects black her neighs
white<00:03:18.950> presses<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.120> black<00:03:21.110> pulls<00:03:21.440> back<00:03:24.670> now

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
white presses and black pulls back now

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.230 
white presses and black pulls back now
white<00:03:26.000> Ataris<00:03:26.750> here<00:03:27.110> notice<00:03:27.760> why<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.820> cannot

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
white Ataris here notice why it cannot

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.480 
white Ataris here notice why it cannot
Atari<00:03:29.780> here<00:03:30.350> because<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.460> black<00:03:32.360> connects

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
Atari here because if so black connects

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.370 
Atari here because if so black connects
why<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.550> has<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:35.000> capture<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:35.630> black<00:03:36.050> stone

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
why it has to capture this black stone

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.090 
why it has to capture this black stone
otherwise<00:03:37.630> black<00:03:38.630> extends<00:03:39.200> here<00:03:39.620> white

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
otherwise black extends here white

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.800 
otherwise black extends here white
corner<00:03:40.520> is<00:03:40.580> dead<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:43.370> white<00:03:44.000> captures<00:03:44.330> this

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
corner is dead so white captures this

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.370 
corner is dead so white captures this
but<00:03:45.800> black<00:03:46.370> gets<00:03:46.670> outside<00:03:47.180> very<00:03:47.750> strong<00:03:48.170> and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
but black gets outside very strong and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.270 
but black gets outside very strong and
these<00:03:48.860> four<00:03:49.540> white<00:03:50.540> stones<00:03:50.930> almost<00:03:51.470> dead<00:03:51.710> so

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
these four white stones almost dead so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.030 
these four white stones almost dead so
this<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.640> not<00:03:52.970> good<00:03:53.270> for<00:03:53.300> what<00:03:56.740> why<00:03:57.740> daughter

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
this is not good for what why daughter

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.400 
this is not good for what why daughter
is<00:03:58.550> here<00:03:59.920> black<00:04:00.920> connects<00:04:01.780> white<00:04:02.780> extends

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
is here black connects white extends

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.820 
is here black connects white extends
black<00:04:04.310> huh<00:04:04.550> neighs<00:04:05.410> why<00:04:06.410> turns<00:04:07.150> black<00:04:08.150> extends

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
black huh neighs why turns black extends

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.100 
black huh neighs why turns black extends
and<00:04:09.830> white<00:04:10.820> extends<00:04:11.890> now<00:04:12.890> black<00:04:13.220> captures

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
and white extends now black captures

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.310 
and white extends now black captures
these<00:04:15.110> three<00:04:15.740> white<00:04:16.100> stones<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.840> result

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
these three white stones and this result

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.870 
these three white stones and this result
is<00:04:18.850> fair<00:04:19.850> for<00:04:20.150> both<00:04:20.209> sides<00:04:20.690> black<00:04:21.470> gets<00:04:21.770> a<00:04:22.070> big

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
is fair for both sides black gets a big

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.670 
is fair for both sides black gets a big
corner<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:25.070> side<00:04:25.720> white<00:04:26.720> gets<00:04:27.020> outside

notice at this point black needs to

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:42.160 
notice at this point black needs to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.940 

that<00:05:09.720> captures<00:05:10.260> wide<00:05:10.920> arteries<00:05:12.110> this<00:05:13.110> code<00:05:13.620> is

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
that captures wide arteries this code is

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.000 
that captures wide arteries this code is
very<00:05:14.190> heavy<00:05:14.550> for<00:05:15.180> black<00:05:15.650> because<00:05:16.650> white<00:05:16.980> is

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
very heavy for black because white is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.350 
very heavy for black because white is
using<00:05:17.700> its<00:05:18.000> dead<00:05:18.480> stones<00:05:19.400> for<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.580> code<00:05:20.880> so

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
using its dead stones for this code so

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.200 
using its dead stones for this code so
this<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.780> clearly<00:05:22.260> good<00:05:22.950> for<00:05:23.190> white<00:05:26.210> that's

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
this is clearly good for white that's

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.510 
this is clearly good for white that's
why<00:05:27.480> at<00:05:27.690> this<00:05:27.870> point<00:05:29.600> black<00:05:30.600> should<00:05:30.900> play<00:05:31.139> this

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
why at this point black should play this

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.680 
why at this point black should play this
and<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:33.450> is<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.750> correct<00:05:34.020> sequence<00:05:38.690> now

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
and this is the correct sequence now

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.220 
and this is the correct sequence now
another<00:05:42.740> strong<00:05:43.740> move<00:05:43.980> black<00:05:44.700> can<00:05:44.940> use<00:05:45.230> is

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
another strong move black can use is

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.100 
another strong move black can use is
double<00:05:46.830> honey<00:05:49.490> if<00:05:50.490> black<00:05:50.970> white<00:05:51.570> arteries

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
double honey if black white arteries

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.600 
double honey if black white arteries
here<00:05:53.480> then<00:05:54.480> black<00:05:54.960> attire<00:05:55.710> is<00:05:55.890> here<00:05:56.370> and

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
here then black attire is here and

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.520 
here then black attire is here and
captures<00:05:57.480> this<00:05:57.690> way<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:57.990> stone<00:05:58.260> so<00:05:58.980> this<00:05:59.280> is

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
captures this way to stone so this is

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.440 
captures this way to stone so this is
super<00:06:01.530> good<00:06:01.710> for<00:06:02.220> black<00:06:02.460> because<00:06:02.940> why<00:06:03.180> it<00:06:03.240> only

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
super good for black because why it only

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.260 
super good for black because why it only
gets<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.900> tiny<00:06:04.169> corner<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:04.890> black<00:06:05.580> outside<00:06:06.000> is

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
gets a tiny corner and black outside is

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.330 
gets a tiny corner and black outside is
very<00:06:06.660> strong

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.430 

if<00:06:13.760> Y<00:06:14.300> daughter<00:06:14.600> is<00:06:15.050> here<00:06:15.590> black<00:06:16.130> connects<00:06:17.440> y

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
if Y daughter is here black connects y

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.260 
if Y daughter is here black connects y
dot<00:06:18.680> our<00:06:18.919> is<00:06:18.949> black<00:06:19.760> connects<00:06:20.169> and<00:06:21.910> if<00:06:22.910> white

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
dot our is black connects and if white

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.689 
dot our is black connects and if white
plays<00:06:24.020> here<00:06:24.880> black<00:06:25.880> cannot<00:06:26.360> hurry<00:06:26.630> here<00:06:27.699> so

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
plays here black cannot hurry here so

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.150 
plays here black cannot hurry here so
why<00:06:28.940> would<00:06:29.000> probably<00:06:29.600> just<00:06:29.810> play<00:06:30.020> here<00:06:30.410> and

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
why would probably just play here and

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.340 
why would probably just play here and
this<00:06:31.370> is<00:06:31.639> a<00:06:31.669> fair<00:06:32.060> result<00:06:32.210> that<00:06:32.840> gets<00:06:33.169> the

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
this is a fair result that gets the

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.960 
this is a fair result that gets the
corner<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:34.389> though<00:06:35.389> why<00:06:36.260> it<00:06:36.320> gets<00:06:36.560> a<00:06:36.970> good

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
corner and though why it gets a good

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.320 
corner and though why it gets a good
shape<00:06:38.300> here<00:06:39.460> so<00:06:40.460> that's<00:06:40.880> the<00:06:41.060> correct

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
shape here so that's the correct

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.940 
shape here so that's the correct
sequence<00:06:41.630> in<00:06:42.080> this<00:06:42.290> scenario<00:06:42.940> thanks
