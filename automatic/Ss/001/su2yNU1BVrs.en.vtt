order<00:02:59.670> entry<00:02:59.910> because<00:03:00.239> now<00:03:00.510> when<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.840> scan

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
order entry because now when you scan

order entry because now when you scan
something<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.739> have<00:03:01.890> much<00:03:02.160> more<00:03:02.190> information

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
something you have much more information

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.759 
something you have much more information
on<00:03:03.269> there<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.660> have<00:03:03.840> product<00:03:04.230> description

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
on there you have product description

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.400 
on there you have product description
you'll<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.910> pricing<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.959> don't<00:03:07.110> even<00:03:07.200> have

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
you'll have pricing and don't even have

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
things like pack size on there so we can

are<00:03:21.900> asking<00:03:22.079> us<00:03:22.349> how<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.530> i<00:03:22.620> afford<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.190> new

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
are asking us how do i afford this new

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.460 
are asking us how do i afford this new
device<00:03:23.700> yes<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:24.269> sounds<00:03:24.660> good<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.290> can

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
device yes it all sounds good and I can

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.590 
device yes it all sounds good and I can
probably<00:03:26.040> make<00:03:26.190> money<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.730> but<00:03:27.209> let's<00:03:27.389> face

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
probably make money on it but let's face

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.720 
probably make money on it but let's face
it<00:03:27.870> these<00:03:28.109> older<00:03:28.440> devices<00:03:28.769> are<00:03:29.130> breaking<00:03:29.549> more

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
it these older devices are breaking more

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.640 
it these older devices are breaking more
often<00:03:30.090> there's<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.720> cost<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.079> maintain<00:03:31.290> these

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
often there's a cost to maintain these

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.280 
often there's a cost to maintain these
old<00:03:31.889> devices<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.910> when<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.239> add<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.480> cost<00:03:34.079> of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
old devices so when you add that cost of

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.229 
old devices so when you add that cost of
maintaining<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.920> old<00:03:35.010> devices<00:03:35.310> plus<00:03:35.940> the

maintaining the old devices plus the

maintaining the old devices plus the
cost<00:03:36.810> savings<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.040> increase

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
cost savings that you have and increase

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.610 
cost savings that you have and increase
sales<00:03:38.700> by<00:03:38.910> putting<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.359> new<00:03:39.480> device<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.380> very

number<00:04:03.419> and<00:04:03.750> they'll<00:04:04.380> estimate<00:04:04.859> all<00:04:05.340> over<00:04:05.639> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730

three<00:04:07.889> and<00:04:07.919> eight<00:04:08.370> percent<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.720> three<00:04:09.989> day

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
three and eight percent so three day

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.930 
three and eight percent so three day
percent<00:04:10.590> doesn't<00:04:10.919> sound<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.370> lot<00:04:11.639> and

just exactly like the same data that

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.540 
just exactly like the same data that
you're<00:06:42.350> receiving<00:06:42.620> today<00:06:42.950> so<00:06:43.100> there's<00:06:43.430> no

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
you're receiving today so there's no

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.880 
changes on the back
but<00:06:45.300> we'll<00:06:45.450> take<00:06:45.630> the<00:06:45.780> old<00:06:45.930> car<00:06:46.200> pick<00:06:46.560> off<00:06:46.710> the

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
but we'll take the old car pick off the

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.710 
but we'll take the old car pick off the
radiator<00:06:47.160> cap<00:06:47.490> slide<00:06:47.850> in<00:06:48.060> a<00:06:48.150> whole<00:06:48.330> new<00:06:48.510> car

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
radiator cap slide in a whole new car

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.720 
radiator cap slide in a whole new car
and<00:06:48.840> put<00:06:48.990> the<00:06:49.080> radiator<00:06:49.500> cap<00:06:49.710> on<00:06:49.890> it<00:06:49.920> so<00:06:50.310> you're

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
and put the radiator cap on it so you're

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.340 
and put the radiator cap on it so you're
basically<00:06:50.880> just<00:06:51.360> migrating<00:06:51.960> to<00:06:52.110> a<00:06:52.140> newer
