like that guy had had quite a bit of
room<00:02:09.560> I'm<00:02:09.739> pretty<00:02:09.950> sure<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:10.459> around<00:02:10.819> him

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
room I'm pretty sure to go around him

room I'm pretty sure to go around him
but<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> don't<00:02:12.830> think<00:02:12.950> anybody<00:02:13.519> has<00:02:14.000> any<00:02:14.360> idea

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:25.119 
but I don't think anybody has any idea
how<00:02:14.989> big<00:02:15.260> their<00:02:15.440> cars<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.860> they're

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
how big their cars and so so they're

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.979 
how big their cars and so so they're
afraid<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.879> mean<00:02:26.060> it's<00:02:26.209> good<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.599> better<00:02:26.750> than

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
afraid I mean it's good it's better than

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.030 
afraid I mean it's good it's better than
thinking<00:02:27.379> it's<00:02:27.560> smaller

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
thinking it's smaller

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:38.860 
thinking it's smaller
your<00:02:28.190> car<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.370> smaller<00:02:28.760> than<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.020 

but<00:02:39.650> yeah<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.980> don't<00:02:40.099> think<00:02:40.400> people<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:40.640> any

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030

added onto the bike and it's such a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.780 
added onto the bike and it's such a
weird<00:02:51.200> one<00:02:51.349> it's<00:02:51.560> not<00:02:51.739> like<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.580> not

weird one it's not like it's not

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.490 
weird one it's not like it's not
something<00:02:53.209> you'd<00:02:53.360> think<00:02:53.569> you'd<00:02:53.810> get<00:02:53.959> excited

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
something you'd think you'd get excited

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.160 
something you'd think you'd get excited
about<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.950> love<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:55.730> awesome

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.990 

it<00:03:00.170> makes<00:03:00.440> using<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.980> motorcycle<00:03:01.579> as<00:03:01.670> your<00:03:01.819> main

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
it makes using a motorcycle as your main

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.960 
it makes using a motorcycle as your main
form<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.420> transportation<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.730> much<00:03:05.000> easier<00:03:05.420> I
