00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.910
It's empty.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.380
Yeah, it's empty.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.050
Empty.
Empty.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.220
How is even it still going?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.020
It's empty but...
How is even it still going?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.070
Honda's amazing.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.600
We're in Numazu now.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
We've arrived in Numazu.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.840
We only filled the tank once and made it to Numazu.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.410
We're cutting it pretty close...

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.410
It's a miracle it's still going.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.910
You said that last time too though.
It's a miracle it's still going.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.820
Yeah...

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.880
Don't you think it'll go another hour?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.290
Uh, definitely not.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.250
Okay, the time is now...

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.520
Just after 3!

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.590
Yup.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.690
We really need gas.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.130
We still have 4 hours to go.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.790
Yup.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.460
There's still...

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.300
1

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.700
2

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.960
3

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.690
4 more.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.270
Including this one, there's 4 gacha balls.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.400
We'll get it this time.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.400
Probability-wise, we'll get it.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
Yeah.
Probability-wise, we'll get it.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.800
It's just a probability matter now.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.770
Yeah.
It's just a probability matter now.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.370
Let's do this.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.010
Yeah.
Let's do this.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.240
Ore, Gachaaan!

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.680
Please, gasoline!

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.580
Please, gasoline!!

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.210
Paaaa!

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.290
And it's blue.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.090
Ready and...

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.760
Oh!

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.000
It's here! It's here! Yay!!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.730
How'd you do that, Megwin?

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.070
How'd you do that?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.470
Thank you, God!

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.740
That's amazing...

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.510
Yes!!

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.340
Ahh...

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.540
That was almost really bad...

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.160
That was dangerous...

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.890
It's right in front of us...

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.530
That was close.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.100
It carked it!

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.000
It stopped?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.460
Yeah.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.830
Amazing...
That was close!

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.400
That was amazing timing.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.470
Praise the lord!
That was amazing timing.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.940
Wow.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.210
We just need to push it over there.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.910
Okay, we got gas.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.180
Switch, on!

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.090
Ohhh!!

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.120
Yeah!!
Ohhh!!

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.220
It's all the way up.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.460
Like an erection.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.390
"Erection!"

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.130
Should we get going?

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.630
Yeah.
Should we get going?

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.930
Today's goal is Shizuoka.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.170
About another 50km (31mi)&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.540
Piece of cake, right?
