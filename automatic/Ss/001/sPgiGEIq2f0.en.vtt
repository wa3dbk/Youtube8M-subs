00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.240
 boned and chopped as you are looking at 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.760
 finite bands 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.630
 here we have half a teaspoon of coffee 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.509
 curry cumin sweet paprika and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.120

 stuffed and what you like the most 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.460

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.310
 like salt and olive oil 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.260
 Well, as always, we do not make a 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.480
 space the table and now what we do 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.730
 it is with the chicken the chicken dish 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.510

 olive and all the species a little bit of 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.310
 salt and now what we do is mix what 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.990

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.820
 the chicken that you leave it for half 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.070
 time that I go taking that water you do 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.740
 the chicken you leave in the fridge and 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.410
 smelled and with the pizza dough turkey 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.510
 If you do not have everything at once we already have 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.479
 the mixed chick and what we do is 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.260
 reserve we put a pan on the fire and 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.240
 we give you maximum power 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.240
 and fry the chicken 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.280
 we already have the chicken done now what 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.810
 let's do is ride the pizza 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.740
 before rolling the piece what 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.560
 We do is preheat the oven to 180 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.830
 degrees cut a piece of albal paper 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.860
