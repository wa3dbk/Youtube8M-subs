00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
time I get fed and it worked out well

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.560 
time I get fed and it worked out well
kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.680> speaking<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.760> had<00:00:35.969> warrior

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
kind of speaking of that you had warrior

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.500 
kind of speaking of that you had warrior
enchantment<00:00:37.129> hexdrinker<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.550> brutalizer<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
enchantment hexdrinker a brutalizer and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.420 
enchantment hexdrinker a brutalizer and
then<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> bilge<00:00:40.440> water<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.800> mean<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.160> lot

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
then a bilge water I mean that's a lot

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
then a bilge water I mean that's a lot
of<00:00:41.460> offensive<00:00:42.000> items<00:00:42.329> talking<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.140> more

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of offensive items talking a bit more

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.720 
of offensive items talking a bit more
through<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.620> mindset<00:00:43.920> why<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
through that mindset why was this the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
through that mindset why was this the
game<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.539> full<00:00:45.840> damage<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.289> by<00:00:46.640> well

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
game to just go full damage on by well

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
game to just go full damage on by well
they<00:00:48.149> buffed<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> yellow<00:00:48.660> trinket<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.350> it's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they buffed the yellow trinket so it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
they buffed the yellow trinket so it's
more<00:00:50.309> efficient<00:00:50.670> than<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> sweeper<00:00:51.120> my<00:00:51.239> opinion

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
more efficient than a sweeper my opinion

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.389 
more efficient than a sweeper my opinion
right<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.050> basically<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> don't<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.280> buy<00:00:53.340> as

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
right now so basically I don't to buy as

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.590 
right now so basically I don't to buy as
many<00:00:53.550> awards<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> lot<00:00:54.360> more

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
many awards so I just have a lot more

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.270 
many awards so I just have a lot more
money<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.930> items<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.710> bilge<00:00:55.920> water<00:00:55.980> might

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
money for items the bilge water might

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.279 
money for items the bilge water might
have<00:00:56.430> been<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.879> overkill<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> just

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
have been a little overkill but I just

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.689 
have been a little overkill but I just
want<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.530> damaged<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:59.010> had<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> mundo

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
want it damaged they had like a mundo

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
want it damaged they had like a mundo
and<00:00:59.789> reksai<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> game<00:01:00.809> prolonged<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and reksai so if the game prolonged I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
and reksai so if the game prolonged I
could<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.920> switch<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> pork<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> she's

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
could have switch to a pork and she's

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.479 
could have switch to a pork and she's
done<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> ton<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> damage<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.400> should

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
done a ton of damage and I really should

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.679 
done a ton of damage and I really should
wanted<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> kill<00:01:05.850> him<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> end<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
wanted to kill him like at the end of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
wanted to kill him like at the end of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
were sort of in a slump going into that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.969

week<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> had<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.470> deal<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.619> jet

lag<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.820> having<00:01:36.119> our<00:01:36.840> normal<00:01:37.560> setup<00:01:37.920> for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
lag not having our normal setup for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.920 
lag not having our normal setup for
practicing<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.329> hard<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.630> us

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
