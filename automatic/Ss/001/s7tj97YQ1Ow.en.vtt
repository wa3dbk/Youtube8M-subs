at first you could kind of see where

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.550 
at first you could kind of see where
when<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> see<00:00:21.600> where<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> find<00:00:22.050> him<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> end

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
when you see where I find him at the end

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.019 
when you see where I find him at the end
you'll<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.070> walked<00:00:23.340> by<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> guy

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you'll see that I walked by the guy

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.689 
you'll see that I walked by the guy
about<00:00:24.359> three<00:00:24.689> times<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.410> then<00:00:25.619> realizes<00:00:26.430> him

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
about three times and then realizes him

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
about three times and then realizes him
but<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.180> good<00:00:27.750> way<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> found<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> find<00:00:28.680> out

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but a good way that I found to find out

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
but a good way that I found to find out
is<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> shoot<00:00:29.189> into<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> crowd<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.970> see

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
is to shoot into the crowd and you see

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
is to shoot into the crowd and you see
how<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> people<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.779> running<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:32.250> p

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
how the people are running if then p

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
how the people are running if then p
only<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> MPC's<00:00:33.390> will<00:00:33.570> run<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.140> he's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
only the MPC's will run so if he's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.630 
only the MPC's will run so if he's
trying<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.559> hide<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> big<00:00:35.070> crowd<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.370> people

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
trying to hide in a big crowd of people

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540 
trying to hide in a big crowd of people
that's<00:00:35.850> always<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> good<00:00:36.420> way<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:37.309> if<00:00:38.309> not

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
that's always a good way to go if not

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.630 
that's always a good way to go if not
you<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.590> press<00:00:40.590> square<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> it'll<00:00:41.370> pull<00:00:41.520> up

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you could press square and it'll pull up

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180 
you could press square and it'll pull up
your<00:00:41.790> profiler<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.020> could<00:00:43.190> individually

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
your profiler and you could individually

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.459 
your profiler and you could individually
check<00:00:44.940> every<00:00:45.420> single<00:00:46.340> person's<00:00:47.340> profile<00:00:48.469> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
check every single person's profile and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
check every single person's profile and
it'll<00:00:49.680> tell<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> hacker<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.550> not

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it'll tell you if it's a hacker or not

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.299 
it'll tell you if it's a hacker or not
and<00:00:51.350> he's<00:00:52.350> still<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> wasn't<00:00:53.219> even

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and he's still right now I wasn't even

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.490 
and he's still right now I wasn't even
started<00:00:53.699> hacking<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.270> once<00:00:54.480> he<00:00:54.600> does<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
started hacking but once he does the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
started hacking but once he does the
closer<00:00:55.829> he<00:00:56.100> gets<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> being<00:00:56.760> completed<00:00:57.120> it'll

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
closer he gets to being completed it'll

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.260 
closer he gets to being completed it'll
narrow<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:58.140> search<00:00:58.410> area<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.090> are

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
narrow your search area so if you are

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
narrow your search area so if you are
invading<00:01:00.750> somebody's<00:01:00.960> game<00:01:01.320> hacking<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
invading somebody's game hacking you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
invading somebody's game hacking you
want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> try<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> keep<00:01:02.640> moving<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.539> can't

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
want to try to keep moving so they can't

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.230 
want to try to keep moving so they can't
narrow<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.260> down<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.949> search<00:01:05.189> area<00:01:05.519> like

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
narrow you down in your search area like

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.520 
narrow you down in your search area like
you'll<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.630> towards<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> end<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> video

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you'll see towards the end of the video

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590 
you'll see towards the end of the video
so<00:01:08.400> basically<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.450> soon

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
so basically what you want to do as soon

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
so basically what you want to do as soon

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
as you find where they're hiding where

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980 
as you find where they're hiding where

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
head like you'll see when I find him and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
head like you'll see when I find him and
that's<00:01:17.100> pretty<00:01:17.310> much<00:01:17.430> how<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that's pretty much how you get it it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
that's pretty much how you get it it's
actually<00:01:19.530> pretty<00:01:19.680> fun<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.189> invaded<00:01:20.460> I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
actually pretty fun to be invaded I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
actually pretty fun to be invaded I
first<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> heard<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.500> were<00:01:22.530> going

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
first when I heard that they were going

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.870 
first when I heard that they were going
to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.860> able<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> invade<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.549> single-player

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to be able to invade your single-player

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
to be able to invade your single-player
game<00:01:24.180> anytime<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.689> thought<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
game anytime I thought it was going to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
game anytime I thought it was going to
be<00:01:25.500> pretty<00:01:25.650> annoying<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.430> didn't<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.479> want

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
be pretty annoying I didn't really want

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
be pretty annoying I didn't really want
people<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.229> bug<00:01:28.619> me<00:01:28.829> while<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.220> trying<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
people to bug me while I was trying to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
people to bug me while I was trying to
play<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.270> pretty<00:01:30.630> fun<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
play but it's actually pretty fun it's a
