well your color will turn red you build

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.280 
well your color will turn red you build
up<00:03:22.640> your<00:03:22.670> little<00:03:22.970> bar<00:03:23.209> build<00:03:23.900> up<00:03:24.019> another

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
up your little bar build up another

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.470 
up your little bar build up another
bigger<00:03:24.590> bar<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.099> that's<00:03:25.849> how<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.120> get<00:03:26.330> your

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
bigger bar and that's how you get your

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.210 
bigger bar and that's how you get your
finisher<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.349> can<00:03:27.500> store<00:03:27.709> three<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.069> these

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
finisher you can store three of these

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.309 
finisher you can store three of these
big<00:03:28.489> bars<00:03:28.730> it's<00:03:29.060> very<00:03:29.450> simplistic<00:03:29.660> but<00:03:30.230> it

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
big bars it's very simplistic but it

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.350 
big bars it's very simplistic but it
works<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:30.680> fine<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:31.250> lot<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.610> animations<00:03:32.120> look

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
works just fine a lot of animations look

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.000 
works just fine a lot of animations look
kind<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.750> stuff<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.410> grappling<00:03:33.830> and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
kind of stuff and the grappling and

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.500 
kind of stuff and the grappling and
punching<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:34.549> not<00:03:34.700> always<00:03:35.000> accurate

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
punching is not always accurate

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.150 
punching is not always accurate
instead<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.170> hitting<00:03:36.500> or<00:03:36.650> grappling<00:03:37.040> your

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
instead of hitting or grappling your

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.190 
instead of hitting or grappling your
opponent<00:03:37.640> you'll<00:03:37.880> go<00:03:38.150> right<00:03:38.180> through<00:03:38.810> them<00:03:39.049> I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
opponent you'll go right through them I

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.229 
opponent you'll go right through them I
didn't<00:03:39.859> know<00:03:39.980> how<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.160> pick<00:03:40.459> up<00:03:40.609> a<00:03:40.700> weapon<00:03:41.060> and

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
didn't know how to pick up a weapon and

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.949 
didn't know how to pick up a weapon and
the<00:03:41.870> manual<00:03:42.230> doesn't<00:03:42.530> actually<00:03:42.890> tell<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.579> how

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
the manual doesn't actually tell you how

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.690 
the manual doesn't actually tell you how
but<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.049> figured<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.500> out<00:03:45.590> eventually<00:03:45.769> one

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
but I figured it out eventually one

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.120 
but I figured it out eventually one
thing<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.150> pretty<00:03:47.239> cool<00:03:47.660> it's<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.799> fact

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
thing that is pretty cool it's the fact

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.710 
thing that is pretty cool it's the fact
that<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.459> can<00:03:49.609> have<00:03:49.760> weapons<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.390> Hell<00:03:50.569> in

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
that you can have weapons in the Hell in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.599 
that you can have weapons in the Hell in
a<00:03:50.810> Cell<00:03:51.019> something<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.950> can<00:03:52.160> do<00:03:52.400> in<00:03:52.459> the

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
a Cell something you can do in the

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.729 
a Cell something you can do in the
Smackdown<00:03:53.030> games<00:03:53.299> at<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.600> time<00:03:53.840> yeah<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.620> know
