00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
this one just did that means that your

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.920 
this one just did that means that your
board<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:27.130> not<00:03:27.670> flowered<00:03:28.450> enough<00:03:28.690> that's

it<00:03:31.690> sticks<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.140> board<00:03:32.380> because<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.860> can

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
it sticks to the board because you can

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.550 
it sticks to the board because you can
just<00:03:33.070> lift<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.489> up<00:03:33.610> with<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.880> spatula<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
like that now if it hadna sticked it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.280 
like that now if it hadna sticked it
would<00:03:46.090> have<00:03:46.180> stick<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.480> here<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.900> I've<00:03:46.990> got<00:03:47.020> to
