00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and this Brassica in clover is actually

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.870 
and this Brassica in clover is actually
coming<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:21.199> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.160> tech

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
coming in really good this is the tech

coat<00:00:28.019> starter<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:30.349> don't<00:00:31.349> know<00:00:31.590> from

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
coat starter which I don't know from

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.610 
coat starter which I don't know from
planting<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.969> then<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
planting this one and then you look and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.750 
planting this one and then you look and
you<00:00:34.739> plant<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> other<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> other<00:00:35.640> one

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you plant the other one the other one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520 
you plant the other one the other one
looks<00:00:36.059> nice<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.420> green<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.899> mostly<00:00:37.230> rye

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
looks nice and green but it's mostly rye

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
looks nice and green but it's mostly rye
grass<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> Brassica<00:00:39.809> didn't<00:00:40.079> make

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
grass a lot of the Brassica didn't make

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.150 
grass a lot of the Brassica didn't make
it<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.500> guess<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.129> just

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it and you know I guess I would just

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.350 
it and you know I guess I would just
have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> attribute<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
have to attribute it to the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
have to attribute it to the
Yellowjackets<00:00:46.289> e-coat<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
Yellowjackets e-coat that you get on the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.299 
Yellowjackets e-coat that you get on the
tackle<00:00:47.579> mati<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.590> I<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> can

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
tackle mati so I don't know if you can

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
tackle mati so I don't know if you can
see<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.850> spot<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:53.010> next<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
see that little spot right there next to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
see that little spot right there next to
the<00:00:53.520> rake<00:00:53.789> where<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> tree<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.930> starting

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the rake where the tree is I'm starting

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.889 
the rake where the tree is I'm starting
actually<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.030> anything<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.690> disc

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually I don't have anything to disc

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
actually I don't have anything to disc
it<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.350> anything<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
it up or anything so I'm just going to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.929 
it up or anything so I'm just going to
hand<00:00:59.809> rake<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.590> ryegrass<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:04.640> as<00:01:05.640> much

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
hand rake that ryegrass down to as much

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
hand rake that ryegrass down to as much
loose<00:01:06.210> dirt<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.640> then<00:01:08.640> I'm

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
loose dirt as I can and then I'm

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.070 
loose dirt as I can and then I'm
probably<00:01:09.119> gonna<00:01:09.390> replant<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:13.070> in<00:01:15.080> something

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
probably gonna replant it in something

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
probably gonna replant it in something
else<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> tech<00:01:17.250> ramadi<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.820> gonna<00:01:18.060> try

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
else with the tech ramadi I'm gonna try

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.020 
else with the tech ramadi I'm gonna try
this<00:01:19.700> no<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.590> ultra<00:01:22.590> forage<00:01:23.070> stand

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
this no it's this ultra forage stand

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.210 
this no it's this ultra forage stand
side<00:01:24.299> hunting<00:01:24.750> plot<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.540> it<00:01:27.540> has<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
side hunting plot and it has that

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.760 
side hunting plot and it has that
Yellowjackets<00:01:29.220> seed<00:01:29.400> coating<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
Yellowjackets seed coating on so it's a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.580 
Yellowjackets seed coating on so it's a
hybrid<00:01:32.430> turnips<00:01:33.090> clover<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> chicory<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
hybrid turnips clover and chicory so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
hybrid turnips clover and chicory so
we'll<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.430> how<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.610> does<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.380> one

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we'll see how it does but just the one

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
we'll see how it does but just the one
side<00:01:40.770> versus<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.189> other<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.970> amazing

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
side versus the other is just amazing

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.050 
side versus the other is just amazing
and<00:01:42.570> how<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.140> how<00:01:43.770> thick<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.430> has<00:01:44.640> come<00:01:44.880> up

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and how and how thick this has come up

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.810 
and how and how thick this has come up
and<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> know<00:01:46.860> yeah<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.520> spots

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and you know yeah there's some spots

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.280 
and you know yeah there's some spots
where<00:01:48.030> they're<00:01:48.210> nipping<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> off

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
where they're nipping the top of it off

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.580 
where they're nipping the top of it off
but<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:51.149> know<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.600> coming<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.049> faster<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
but you know it's coming up faster and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.030 
but you know it's coming up faster and
thicker<00:01:52.950> than<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.460> need<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.079> I'm

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
thicker than they can need it so I'm

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.420 
thicker than they can need it so I'm
gonna<00:01:56.189> try<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> rest<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> looking
