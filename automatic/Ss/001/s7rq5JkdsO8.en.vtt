00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.629
 and this would be the revelation of the trick of 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.650
 magic with letter we made in the video 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.110
 previous but the video passes x 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.020
 here I leave the link up here nati 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.330
 follow short and see the first and then 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.810
 They come and see the revelation either want 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.250
 know how it is done 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.230
 - 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.110
 I think you have to do to make 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.380
 this magic trick is to separate all the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.080
 eight and the nine one that we already have it to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.599
 14 for the 89 we are going to put it now in 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.000
 the top and we're going to start 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.350
 toggle if we are going to put a letter 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.760
 common one 8 or 9 one common letter one another 9 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.440
 a letter 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.930
 let's go alternating a common letter 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.590
 anyone with one of the eight or nine 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.590
 that we already separated 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.710
 you do not have to finally get a letter 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.190
 anybody would not be left 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.390
 this one any letter and a eight or 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.660
 nine if a letter to any 1819 a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.060
 letter an 8 a letter 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.800
 if we have an alternate plane, that is, 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.110
 we have 16 letters alternated with the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.000
 9 others 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.680
 Now that we have the whole letter 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.450
 have accommodated 8 and 9 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.640
 accommodated interspersed with common letters 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.910
 and we're going to give one of the people to 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.310
 cut a quarter of the deck if no more 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.200
 of this and he's going to give it to the other 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.450
 person that would be in this case so that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.450
 have it and if you want to cover it up 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.750
 of this more now we will give you choose 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.820
 janati any letter and she's going 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.130
 to show and with the excuse that she the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.900
 show and that I do not see it I'm going 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.050
 to turn around and I'll do it back 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.160
 so I discount eight letters 1 2 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.860
 3 4 5 6 7 8 and I'm going to stay with this 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.500
 yes when I half turn after her 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.630
 I have shown the letter he will put it here 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.840
 I want to pass the letter will be in the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.899
 position number 9 and we put the 8 letters 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.150
 over now she's going to have the mallet 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.370
 this 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.149
 and from this March what we 're going to have to 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.550
 do now it's the same start telling if 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.490
 to throw a letter here and not tell you enough 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.960
 when she wants but I would have to 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.970
 be counting mentally how many 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.920
 letters are going to fall here and mentally 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.920
 then I count 1 2 3 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.410
 Four. Five 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.200
 and said enough in an odd letter that what 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.850
 what's going to happen if it's odd if it's the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.980
 first letter and we throw a 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.530
 common letter what will happen is that in 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.740
 ellingham this letter is going to be a letter 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.590
 common yes and this letter is going to be an eight or 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.390
 nine then if it's odd I have to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.210
 turn the letter that I have still 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.240
 in the bone stock we count five has 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.990
 turned the people around the letter of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.450
 mallet is a new one and if she had done 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.030
 six instead of stopping at 5 18 6 this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.290
 letter that 89 was going to fall to the hand of 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.650
 nobody was going to make him give 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.200
 turn the letter of no one's hand yes and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.410
 we have the 9 what there is once 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.900
 came out the letter we said is 1989 ready 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.180
 great we get this we're going to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.940
 talk hold it and now here we go to 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.340
 count not of cards 1 2 3 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.190
 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 remember that the position 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.260
 number 9 is the letter that she had 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.600
 chosen not then if it is 8 if the number 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.490
 10 is idol 8 the letter that I left 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.740
 I had to turn the letter of my 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.380
 hand or the letter that has not yet fallen 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.730
 but how it came out 9 the chosen card fell 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.060
 the hand to nobody so I'm going to do it 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.670
 back to nati 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.790
 and to be in that place the letter that 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.069
 he chose nothing 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.250
 good but that you enjoyed yourself 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.500
