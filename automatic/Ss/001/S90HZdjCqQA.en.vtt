00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
vegetarian I think that's commendable

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.440 
vegetarian I think that's commendable
but<00:00:36.770> I<00:00:36.830> think<00:00:37.190> if<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.640> really<00:00:37.970> want<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.210> live

but I think if you really want to live

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.330 
but I think if you really want to live
that<00:00:38.750> principle<00:00:39.350> full<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.830> its<00:00:39.980> fullest

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
that principle full to its fullest

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.820 
that principle full to its fullest
extent<00:00:40.610> possible<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.840> its<00:00:41.960> most<00:00:42.200> rigorous

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
extent possible and to its most rigorous

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.000 
extent possible and to its most rigorous
extent<00:00:43.190> possible<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.820> think<00:00:44.500> you<00:00:45.500> need<00:00:45.650> to<00:00:45.800> get

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
extent possible I think you need to get

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.040 
extent possible I think you need to get
the<00:00:46.370> products<00:00:46.790> of<00:00:46.850> exploitation<00:00:47.360> off<00:00:47.630> of<00:00:47.930> your

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
the products of exploitation off of your

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.840 
the products of exploitation off of your
plate<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.470> think<00:00:49.310> that's<00:00:49.460> really<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.760> first

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
plate I think that's really the first

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.340 
plate I think that's really the first
place<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.180> need<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.360> start<00:00:50.540> mm-hm

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
place we need to start mm-hm

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.800 
place we need to start mm-hm
I<00:00:51.380> think<00:00:51.980> if<00:00:52.070> you're<00:00:52.220> going<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.670> be<00:00:53.450> serious

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
I think if you're going to be serious

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.210 
I think if you're going to be serious
about<00:00:53.870> animal<00:00:54.260> rights<00:00:54.440> if<00:00:54.860> you're<00:00:54.980> gonna<00:00:55.070> be

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
about animal rights if you're gonna be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.710 
about animal rights if you're gonna be

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
serious about living it in your life the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720 
serious about living it in your life the
first<00:00:56.960> place<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.260> begin<00:00:57.380> is<00:00:57.620> not<00:00:58.160> by<00:00:58.310> consuming

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
first place to begin is not by consuming

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.050 
first place to begin is not by consuming
the<00:00:58.790> products<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.810> are<00:01:00.910> directly<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
the products that are directly the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.439 
the products that are directly the
result<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.050> torture<00:01:03.380> of<00:01:03.590> animals<00:01:04.239> okay<00:01:05.239> I

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
result of the torture of animals okay I

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.780 
result of the torture of animals okay I
also<00:01:06.320> think<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.190> lot<00:01:07.340> of<00:01:07.370> ways<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
also think in a lot of ways the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.450 
also think in a lot of ways the
vegetarian<00:01:08.270> is<00:01:08.600> based<00:01:09.050> on<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.100> think<00:01:10.220> is

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
vegetarian is based on what I think is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.460 
vegetarian is based on what I think is
an<00:01:10.610> ancient<00:01:10.850> notion<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.510> animal<00:01:11.810> production<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
an ancient notion of animal production a

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.700 
an ancient notion of animal production a
lot<00:01:13.070> of<00:01:13.220> us<00:01:13.370> don't<00:01:13.670> have<00:01:13.820> any<00:01:14.180> idea<00:01:14.560> what<00:01:15.560> goes

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
lot of us don't have any idea what goes

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.320 
lot of us don't have any idea what goes
into<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.100> production<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:16.880> things<00:01:17.150> that

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
into the production of the things that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.550 
into the production of the things that
we<00:01:17.420> consume<00:01:17.780> right<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:18.170> kind<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.350> hidden

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
we consume right it's kind of hidden

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.620 
we consume right it's kind of hidden
from<00:01:18.800> us<00:01:18.980> we<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:19.520> see<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.030> product<00:01:20.360> itself

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
from us we just see the product itself

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.200 
from us we just see the product itself
and<00:01:20.870> I<00:01:21.860> think<00:01:22.070> for<00:01:22.370> vegetarians<00:01:22.910> ovo-lacto

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
and I think for vegetarians ovo-lacto

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.780 
and I think for vegetarians ovo-lacto
vegetarian<00:01:24.080> ISM<00:01:24.290> for<00:01:24.440> example<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:25.730> is

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
vegetarian ISM for example and this is

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.490 
vegetarian ISM for example and this is
the<00:01:25.940> way<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.060> was<00:01:26.270> in<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.420> past<00:01:26.630> right<00:01:26.900> I<00:01:27.050> used

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the way I was in the past right I used

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.900 
the way I was in the past right I used
to<00:01:27.590> assume<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.190> animal<00:01:28.460> products<00:01:28.760> that

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
to assume that the animal products that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.130 
to assume that the animal products that
I<00:01:28.940> was<00:01:29.150> consuming<00:01:29.600> as<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> novo

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
lacto-vegetarian that those products

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.760 
lacto-vegetarian that those products
were<00:01:32.600> not<00:01:32.750> responsible<00:01:33.140> for<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.500> death<00:01:33.650> of

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770

sensible but it's also wrong and it's
wrong<00:01:49.909> because<00:01:50.300> it's<00:01:51.200> just<00:01:51.470> untrue<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.190> way

all the male chicks

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.230 
all the male chicks
you<00:02:16.370> gas<00:02:16.550> them<00:02:16.760> or<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.880> throw<00:02:17.060> em<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.180> a

life you know is done that's so not the
case<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.660> mean<00:03:14.810> they<00:03:14.990> are<00:03:15.080> killed<00:03:15.350> if<00:03:15.530> they're

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
case I mean they are killed if they're

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.050

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.820 
stop being productive they're killed
it's<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.870> simple<00:03:18.050> they<00:03:18.290> don't<00:03:18.320> just<00:03:18.620> die

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
it's that simple they don't just die

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.440 
it's that simple they don't just die
they<00:03:19.070> are<00:03:19.100> killed<00:03:19.490> well<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> lot<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.090> them<00:03:20.300> die

think about men again we have the

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.940 
think about men again we have the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
up as veal right so we have this

up as veal right so we have this

so you often hear this this kind of
maxim<00:04:43.099> or<00:04:43.219> this<00:04:43.400> idea<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.210> there's<00:04:44.629> a<00:04:44.719> little

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
maxim or this idea that there's a little

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.600 
maxim or this idea that there's a little
bit<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.169> veal<00:04:45.319> in<00:04:45.469> every<00:04:45.680> glass<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:46.069> milk<00:04:46.189> and<00:04:46.400> I

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
bit of veal in every glass of milk and I

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.350 
bit of veal in every glass of milk and I
like<00:04:46.849> that<00:04:47.000> idea

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
like that idea

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.580 
like that idea
I<00:04:47.509> mean<00:04:47.659> I<00:04:47.719> don't<00:04:47.780> like<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.110> idea<00:04:48.319> that<00:04:48.439> there

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
I mean I don't like the idea that there

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.200 
I mean I don't like the idea that there
is<00:04:48.620> but<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:48.919> like<00:04:49.099> that<00:04:49.310> notion<00:04:49.550> of<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:49.939> because

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
is but I like that notion of it because

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.700 
is but I like that notion of it because
in<00:04:50.599> order<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.229> glass<00:04:51.409> of<00:04:51.469> milk

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
in order to have that glass of milk

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.959 
in order to have that glass of milk
there<00:04:51.889> has<00:04:52.039> to<00:04:52.069> be<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> production<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.849> veal

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
there has to be the production of veal

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.110 
there has to be the production of veal
as<00:04:53.150> well<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:54.080> know<00:04:54.169> so<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:54.830> think<00:04:54.979> dairy<00:04:55.879> cows

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
as well you know so I think dairy cows

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.029 
as well you know so I think dairy cows
are<00:04:56.300> spent<00:04:56.599> producing<00:04:57.229> dairy<00:04:57.379> and<00:04:57.680> they<00:04:57.800> die

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
are spent producing dairy and they die

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.700 
are spent producing dairy and they die
directly<00:04:58.849> because<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.659> the<00:05:00.229> fact<00:05:00.439> they're<00:05:00.620> not

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
directly because of the fact they're not

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.550 
directly because of the fact they're not
in<00:05:00.800> order<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.129> produce<00:05:01.969> more<00:05:02.120> dairy<00:05:02.539> so<00:05:03.439> in

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
in order to produce more dairy so in

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.409 
in order to produce more dairy so in
fact<00:05:03.770> if<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:04.009> think<00:05:04.039> about<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:05.000> products

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
fact if you think about it the products

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.029 
fact if you think about it the products
that<00:05:05.539> ovo-lacto<00:05:05.930> vegetarians<00:05:06.740> consume

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
that ovo-lacto vegetarians consume

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.279 
that ovo-lacto vegetarians consume
actually<00:05:08.000> could<00:05:08.360> even<00:05:08.659> create<00:05:09.020> more

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
actually could even create more

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.730 
actually could even create more
suffering<00:05:09.710> than<00:05:09.979> meat<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.610> agree<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:12.020> worse<00:05:12.409> I

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
suffering than meat I agree so worse I

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.950 
suffering than meat I agree so worse I
think<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:13.699> worse<00:05:13.849> in<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.300> lot<00:05:14.449> of<00:05:14.539> ways<00:05:14.659> -<00:05:14.840> I'm

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
think it's worse in a lot of ways - I'm

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.089 
think it's worse in a lot of ways - I'm
not<00:05:15.080> saying<00:05:15.259> you<00:05:15.319> should<00:05:15.439> eat<00:05:15.560> meat<00:05:15.770> but<00:05:15.979> I'm

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
not saying you should eat meat but I'm

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.290 
not saying you should eat meat but I'm
just<00:05:16.279> saying<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.610> if<00:05:16.819> you<00:05:16.909> look<00:05:17.090> at<00:05:17.210> the

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
just saying that if you look at the

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.550 
just saying that if you look at the
long-term<00:05:17.509> suffering<00:05:18.139> involved<00:05:18.379> in

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
long-term suffering involved in

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.990 
long-term suffering involved in
producing<00:05:18.800> an<00:05:19.039> egg<00:05:19.129> the<00:05:19.310> long-term<00:05:19.610> suffering

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
producing an egg the long-term suffering

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.399 
producing an egg the long-term suffering
involved<00:05:20.210> in<00:05:20.389> producing<00:05:20.629> a<00:05:20.840> glass<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.229> milk

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
involved in producing a glass of milk

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.390 
involved in producing a glass of milk
and<00:05:21.590> cheese<00:05:22.449> everybody<00:05:23.449> loves<00:05:23.659> cheese<00:05:24.400> what

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
and cheese everybody loves cheese what

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.019 
and cheese everybody loves cheese what
the<00:05:25.520> fuck<00:05:25.699> anyway<00:05:26.090> um<00:05:26.270> so<00:05:27.340> being<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.460> vegetarian

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
the fuck anyway um so being a vegetarian

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.839 
the fuck anyway um so being a vegetarian
for<00:05:29.180> animal<00:05:29.509> rights<00:05:29.659> reasons<00:05:30.139> makes<00:05:30.379> no<00:05:30.560> sense

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
for animal rights reasons makes no sense

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.730 
for animal rights reasons makes no sense
because<00:05:31.849> you<00:05:32.479> are<00:05:32.569> really<00:05:32.990> still<00:05:33.050> consuming

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
because you are really still consuming

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.059 
because you are really still consuming
the<00:05:34.039> products<00:05:34.400> of<00:05:34.490> animal<00:05:34.639> exploitation<00:05:36.069> what

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
the products of animal exploitation what

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.980 
the products of animal exploitation what
do<00:05:37.129> you<00:05:37.190> think<00:05:37.310> of<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.509> make<00:05:38.509> sense<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.870> me

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
do you think of that make sense to me

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.279 
do you think of that make sense to me
okay<00:05:39.440> uh<00:05:39.650> that's<00:05:40.159> another<00:05:40.909> step<00:05:41.210> through<00:05:41.569> my

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
okay uh that's another step through my

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.640 
okay uh that's another step through my
logic<00:05:42.740> here<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:44.870> know<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.229> other<00:05:45.349> thing<00:05:45.529> is

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
logic here you know the other thing is

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.649 
logic here you know the other thing is
is<00:05:45.830> that<00:05:45.979> I<00:05:46.039> I<00:05:46.159> think<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.759> lot<00:05:46.909> of<00:05:46.940> vegetarians

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
is that I I think a lot of vegetarians

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.390 
is that I I think a lot of vegetarians
don't<00:05:48.379> want<00:05:48.589> to<00:05:48.650> go<00:05:48.710> vegan<00:05:48.889> because<00:05:49.279> they

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
don't want to go vegan because they

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.950 
don't want to go vegan because they
don't<00:05:49.610> want<00:05:49.759> to<00:05:49.819> see<00:05:49.909> him<00:05:50.000> as<00:05:50.089> extreme<00:05:50.509> as<00:05:50.750> us

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
don't want to see him as extreme as us

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.140 
don't want to see him as extreme as us
crazy<00:05:51.229> vegans<00:05:51.650> I<00:05:51.889> felt<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.699> way<00:05:52.819> for<00:05:53.000> a<00:05:53.060> while

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
crazy vegans I felt that way for a while

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.490 
crazy vegans I felt that way for a while
as<00:05:53.330> a<00:05:53.360> vegetarian<00:05:53.779> I<00:05:53.810> was<00:05:53.900> like<00:05:53.990> oh<00:05:54.020> fuck<00:05:54.319> the

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
as a vegetarian I was like oh fuck the

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.040 
as a vegetarian I was like oh fuck the
vegans<00:05:55.089> but<00:05:56.089> if<00:05:56.180> you<00:05:56.240> think<00:05:56.419> about<00:05:56.599> it<00:05:56.870> which

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
vegans but if you think about it which

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.779 
vegans but if you think about it which
is<00:05:57.199> what<00:05:57.770> I<00:05:57.800> ended<00:05:57.919> up<00:05:58.069> doing<00:05:58.219> at<00:05:58.430> some<00:05:58.580> point

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
is what I ended up doing at some point

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:01.149 
is what I ended up doing at some point
in<00:05:58.849> my<00:05:58.909> life<00:05:58.939> there's<00:05:59.900> no<00:06:00.229> valid<00:06:00.710> reason<00:06:01.009> to<00:06:01.039> be

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
in my life there's no valid reason to be

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.829 
in my life there's no valid reason to be
vegetarian<00:06:01.789> if<00:06:01.909> you<00:06:02.000> care<00:06:02.270> about<00:06:02.360> animal

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:02.839 
vegetarian if you care about animal

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.059 
vegetarian if you care about animal

vegetarian for animal rights is

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.100 
vegetarian for animal rights is
completely<00:06:13.219> illogical<00:06:13.750> given<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.870> way<00:06:14.990> in

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
completely illogical given the way in

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.600 
completely illogical given the way in
which<00:06:15.259> our<00:06:15.469> productive<00:06:16.189> system<00:06:16.520> is

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
which our productive system is

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.029 
which our productive system is
structured<00:06:16.849> you<00:06:17.029> cannot<00:06:17.529> care<00:06:18.529> about<00:06:18.740> animal

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
structured you cannot care about animal

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.189

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
vegetarian does something about it

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.700 
vegetarian does something about it
because<00:06:22.669> it<00:06:22.819> doesn't<00:06:22.990> it's<00:06:23.990> not<00:06:24.110> consistent

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
because it doesn't it's not consistent

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.200 
because it doesn't it's not consistent
all<00:06:25.129> the<00:06:25.189> way<00:06:25.370> through<00:06:25.460> it's<00:06:26.419> not<00:06:26.569> logical

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
all the way through it's not logical

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.779 
all the way through it's not logical
okay<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:29.990> veganism<00:06:30.889> is<00:06:31.189> really<00:06:31.490> the<00:06:31.580> only

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
okay so veganism is really the only

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.339
