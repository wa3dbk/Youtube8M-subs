00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.440
 Hello everyone, today we will deal with you 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.840
 little song 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.840
 group metallica us and look cute 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:24.890
 I will see myself 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.289
 in a slow bit as usual 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.200
 attention to the fingering I put 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:50.920
 fingers and you will be all clear build 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:50.920
 we will have guitars that means playing 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.780
 and 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.320
 three times we play an open string big 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.729
 note that i'm playing bass me 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.729
 big . starts up on the fifth string 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.050
 gives me support and I recommend you also 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.050
 play this way 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.950
 for the fourth mind we play the following 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.410
 then the main difficulty here will be 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.000
 performance 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:27.600
 these are the melody of honor he and the sexes 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.260
 it means delivery we played three times but 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.260
 for string 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.000
 for the fourth mind on play the following 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:59.240
 mean along with the open second country 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:03.100
 and after that giving them the first 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.100
 string on the seventh fret 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.650
 and make a slide from 8 to 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:26.170
 again we play with open 2 string and 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:28.980
 after that again we need 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.980
 it will turn out like this 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:45.630
 here also we use for imps in 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.090
 this moment we have 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:04:03.030
 the notes are played by taking staccato i.e. 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:04:08.870
 jerky also turns out we play 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:13.670
 with the bass we move notes 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.670
 hand ask hands a year ahead 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.670
 losing 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.520
 this is the moment of difficult sand we played 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.520
 the cord 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:19.340
 and play again 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.340
 covered strings 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.120
 for the fourth time we will beat 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.120
 this chord 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.860
 mean for the third time we have 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:00.099
 the original song comes old 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:04.039
 guitar so I will commission the guitar 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:07.509
 arranged here for the first detail batch 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.509
 it should be like this 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:42.830
 this moment here we play along with 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:45.139
 Bass pulls off our size three 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:57.639
 quarters are blurry or 3 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:57.639
 we should get this
