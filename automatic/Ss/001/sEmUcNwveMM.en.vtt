00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
closer look at it so here's the I guess

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.079 
closer look at it so here's the I guess
you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.839> say<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> cobalt<00:00:43.920> has<00:00:44.249> up<00:00:44.579> Spartan

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and this looks really cool it's based on

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450 
and this looks really cool it's based on
the<00:00:47.789> reach<00:00:48.300> figures<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.929> has<00:00:49.499> about<00:00:49.739> 12<00:00:50.159> points
