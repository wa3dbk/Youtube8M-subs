00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hey guys, you still know how 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.890
 earlier every video plays so right 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.880
 Magical was like it almost 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.620
 unimaginable how much effort in such 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.690
 I put a game in it have me 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 always presented that expert teams too 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 Hundreds of weeks spread over so 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.910
 to play a game and a lot 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
 have and manpower reingesteckt money 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.480
 must until it can come in the trade 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.460
 and playing years later was one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 this game again and then you realize 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.130
 first how cheap the partly actually 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.650
 were made 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.900
 one of these games one of these games 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.070
 from the super big cheap trash r 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.840
 I found it again is mystic 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 out is a kind of scary adventure that's on 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.890
 the good traditions of adventures 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 Everything is supposed to be based on the first 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 person perspective you control his 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 spielfigur by scary haunted 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 outside looks for an exit 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.210
 it was created around 95 or 96 around 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 I really tried something about the game 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 but to find out everything I do 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.460
 it was found that the game 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 in a game box has appeared at 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 Aldi was also sold through the makers 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.060
 the apparently sono precise there were none 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.880
 info like me to a game box of 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.049
 aldi is coming let me tell you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.180
 introduce father 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.220
 He looks like I'm only with more belly 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.640
 more barth more glasses but less 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 hair yes Sun in about ten we just 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.560
 never to rate hitting quite 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.509
 Well 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.430
 my father already liked computer games 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.619
 always and as a good schwabe brand still 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.770
 Something else, if something cheap 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.150
 is and was his maxime 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.040
 computer games and heritage makes her 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.259
 track there as it is a cheap computer game 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.979
 at the ellerbeker why I so over him 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.540
 strutting 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.790
 because it's a big probability 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.439
 gives that he sees this video my 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.780
 father had to lawn mower 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.090
 Anyway, so you get to one 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.729
 great game box the funky titles 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.680
 contains like yucatan master quiz casino 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.110
 Deluxe but also classic like 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.899
 mindscape school champion or country 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.509
 junior cat racing but also mystic 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.659
 out and that's what we're looking at 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.659
 on 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.720
 I remember how it started back then 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.330
 It was a mild summer 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.420
 came on an evening walk 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.710
 I return to the old abandoned 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.050
 stay in the country house 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.700
 the villagers 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:39.540
 40 jungheinrich things play it was the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.830
 talking about haunted and roll read 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.630
 when I drive the house that day 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.600
 I just had to go see 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.560
 it was like an invisible force 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.560
 me as high 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.010
 I'll do all those things on mine too 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.010
 It was not there 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.620
 and suddenly, thanks for that 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.129
 ok now that we know that the makers 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.870
 at least mediocre knowledge in the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.280
 dealing with a 3d models had 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.439
 we enter the tastefully 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:36.040
 furnished property and meet 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:40.109
 first this guy here where words 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.109
 only a new rubric can help 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.040
 okay from the fireplace spirits we drive 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.720
 at least that will posmyk in the spirit 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.400
 Moss must defeat and with a 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.169
 create potion from the garage 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.720
 during his birthday the combination 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.760
 for a box is because that's it 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.930
 what fireplace spirits commonly like 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.519
 speak logic so let's get that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.560
 box and a hammer from the garage 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.030
 to hit a glass, find one 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.289
 key in a book and ask one 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.930
 another spirit for advice 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.000
 the date of birth of the fireplace spirit stands 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.500
 in one of the books we go now so 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.060
 to the upper floor after we 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.060
 refuse to speak with the doorknob 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.570

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.229
 Armed on the attic where we have one 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.520

 Actually, a guardian is involved 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.530
 We can bribe a pole 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.150

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.180

 and here I know that my assi 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.670
 reviews have always been wrong cut 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.460
 it would have been correct as well 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.060
 the whole always played beside 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.060
 played 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:21.019
 So there is this guy called nexus one 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.019

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.789
 Actually, like me anyway, he drinks 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.999
 The stuff that shrinks is from the 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.399
 cat eaten and after fabled eleven 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:41.849
 minutes of playing time we will be here with 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.849
 rewarded 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.280
 yes like I just got a 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.750
 load the game and add the game to it 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.490
 It was difficult to know about it 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.169
 pleased that on the cd the solution in 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.290
 text ev is included 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:03.440
 but how is this play and oh so 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.760
 the fans meant well and objectively 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.100
 To be honest, one has to say 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.820
 it's pretty much the worst 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.040
 adventure that you live someone 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.630
 played on the other hand acts 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.169
 in places as if a few had 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.940
 Friends is trying a nice little one 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:18.380
 to build games and if that really 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.240
 the goal I have to say that they have 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.490
 and that's done somewhere 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.580
 nice if it really is 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.380
 serious attempt was so bad clown 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.350
 or build a horror adventure then 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.780
 well, luck, and you do not have that today 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:36.380
 made 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:39.800
 who is not naughty and small to the family 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.030
 was famous and dreaded because of her 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.950
 bravery 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.570
 Thank you very much for reviewing this 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.280
 looked at and the player tolerated 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.060
 I'm going to start firing now 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.060
 Thank you very much 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.330

 God in heaven
