00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.690 
know and and you can overclock it you
can<00:01:53.530> see<00:01:53.650> right<00:01:53.799> here<00:01:53.829> this<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.310> my<00:01:54.400> current

this Nvidia inspector has a way of

this Nvidia inspector has a way of
applying<00:02:21.370> profiles<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.180> certain<00:02:22.480> games<00:02:22.690> and

applying profiles to certain games and
everything<00:02:23.079> like

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
everything like

the<00:02:54.069> latest<00:02:54.580> beta<00:02:55.030> drivers<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.599> they<00:02:55.750> have

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the latest beta drivers that they have

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.530 
the latest beta drivers that they have
because<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> beta<00:02:57.489> drivers<00:02:57.880> often<00:02:58.329> have<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
because the beta drivers often have a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.270 
because the beta drivers often have a
lot<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.840> optimizations<00:02:59.590> for<00:02:59.650> latest<00:03:00.069> games

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
lot of optimizations for latest games

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.039 
lot of optimizations for latest games
that<00:03:00.489> aren't<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.910> release<00:03:01.269> driver<00:03:01.569> yet<00:03:01.840> so

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
that aren't in the release driver yet so

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.449 
that aren't in the release driver yet so
it's<00:03:02.200> worth<00:03:02.380> running<00:03:02.650> them<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:03.040> long<00:03:03.250> as

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
it's worth running them as long as

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.800 
it's worth running them as long as
they're<00:03:03.579> stable<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.090> they're<00:03:04.239> not<00:03:04.360> stable<00:03:04.750> in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
they're stable if they're not stable in

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.150 
they're stable if they're not stable in
your<00:03:04.930> system<00:03:05.230> then<00:03:05.380> shitcan<00:03:05.799> them<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.069> go

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
your system then shitcan them and go

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.369 
your system then shitcan them and go
back<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.579> release<00:03:06.880> in<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:08.049> case<00:03:08.200> I'm

latest beta driver and recommended for
Crysis<00:03:13.989> 3<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:15.250> video<00:03:15.400> I'm<00:03:15.610> going<00:03:15.700> to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
Crysis 3 so in this video I'm going to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.670 
Crysis 3 so in this video I'm going to
show<00:03:15.879> you<00:03:15.910> how<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.150> how<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.510> tweak<00:03:17.019> Crysis<00:03:17.650> 3

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680

again<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.299> UI<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.810> most<00:03:29.079> unintuitive

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
again the UI is the most unintuitive

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.729 
again the UI is the most unintuitive
thing<00:03:30.250> ever<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.269> if<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> developer<00:03:32.139> of<00:03:32.170> this

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
thing ever so if the developer of this

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.599 
thing ever so if the developer of this
tool<00:03:32.980> actually<00:03:33.340> watches<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.209> video<00:03:34.359> um

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
tool actually watches this video um

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.009 
tool actually watches this video um
these<00:03:36.609> two<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.209> got<00:03:37.389> to<00:03:37.510> do<00:03:37.630> something<00:03:37.900> about

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
these two you got to do something about

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.990 
these two you got to do something about
this<00:03:38.260> UI<00:03:38.500> or<00:03:38.650> add<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> wizard<00:03:39.370> or<00:03:39.519> something<00:03:39.819> for

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
this UI or add a wizard or something for

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.490 
this UI or add a wizard or something for
us<00:03:40.060> dumb<00:03:40.329> people

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
us dumb people

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.990 
us dumb people
so<00:03:41.769> anyways<00:03:42.099> up<00:03:42.250> here<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.459> have<00:03:42.549> profiles

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so anyways up here you have profiles

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.550 
so anyways up here you have profiles
right<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:43.989> go<00:03:44.079> ahead<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.410> flip

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
right so you can go ahead and flip

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.890 
right so you can go ahead and flip
through<00:03:44.769> them<00:03:44.829> there<00:03:45.010> are<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> lot<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.060> profiles

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
through them there are a lot of profiles

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.300 
through them there are a lot of profiles
in<00:03:47.109> here<00:03:47.230> I'd<00:03:47.319> be<00:03:47.470> surprised<00:03:47.829> if<00:03:48.010> your<00:03:48.130> game

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
in here I'd be surprised if your game

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.120 
in here I'd be surprised if your game
was<00:03:48.459> not<00:03:48.639> listed<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:50.139> this<00:03:50.560> case<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:50.920> went<00:03:51.010> to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
was not listed so in this case I went to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.490 
was not listed so in this case I went to
Crysis<00:03:51.519> 3<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.150> select<00:03:52.299> Crysis<00:03:52.750> 3<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.139> you

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
Crysis 3 so you select Crysis 3 and you

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.809 
Crysis 3 so you select Crysis 3 and you
go<00:03:53.590> down<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:53.889> can<00:03:54.010> see<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.430> all<00:03:54.579> these

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
go down you can see that all these

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.280 
go down you can see that all these
values<00:03:55.180> have<00:03:55.359> been<00:03:55.450> modified<00:03:55.780> it's<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.139> bunch

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
values have been modified it's a bunch

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.020 
values have been modified it's a bunch
of<00:03:56.410> gobbledygook<00:03:56.889> here<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.280> have<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.940> know

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
of gobbledygook here you have you know

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.640 
of gobbledygook here you have you know
here's<00:03:58.419> a<00:03:58.480> bunch<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.720> basically<00:03:59.109> constant

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
here's a bunch of basically constant

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.920 
here's a bunch of basically constant
defined<00:03:59.769> values<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.880> driver<00:04:01.180> uses<00:04:01.569> and

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
defined values that the driver uses and

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.400 
defined values that the driver uses and
it<00:04:02.530> tweaked<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.919> whole<00:04:03.040> bunch<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.340> them<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.410> up

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
it tweaked a whole bunch of them so up

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.870 
it tweaked a whole bunch of them so up
here<00:04:05.799> what<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.190> need<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.400> do<00:04:06.519> is<00:04:06.639> you're<00:04:06.790> not

says<00:04:13.329> add<00:04:13.540> application<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.590> current<00:04:14.889> profile

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
says add application to current profile

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.190 
says add application to current profile
so<00:04:15.970> now<00:04:16.090> Crysis<00:04:16.510> 3<00:04:16.539> so<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.810> click<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.139> button

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
so now Crysis 3 so you click that button

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.170 
so now Crysis 3 so you click that button
and<00:04:17.590> then<00:04:18.099> go<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.549> directory<00:04:18.940> where<00:04:19.060> your

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
and then go to the directory where your

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.089 
and then go to the directory where your
Crysis<00:04:19.630> 3<00:04:19.660> install<00:04:20.260> is<00:04:20.440> which<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:20.799> this<00:04:20.889> case

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
Crysis 3 install is which in this case
