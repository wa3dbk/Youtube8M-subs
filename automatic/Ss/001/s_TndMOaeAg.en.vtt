we<00:03:05.180> have<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:05.420> street<00:03:05.810> back<00:03:06.110> here<00:03:06.380> my<00:03:07.250> library

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
we have this street back here my library

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.090 
we have this street back here my library
lobby<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.330> upload<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.630> deal<00:03:09.040> probably<00:03:10.040> this

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
lobby to upload the deal probably this

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.120 
lobby to upload the deal probably this
one<00:03:10.190> too<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:13.540> there's<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.600> road<00:03:14.840> right<00:03:15.230> come

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
one too and there's a road right come

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.120 
one too and there's a road right come
out<00:03:16.280> at<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:18.260> then<00:03:18.380> we<00:03:18.470> just<00:03:18.500> go<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.770> little<00:03:18.980> bit

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
out at and then we just go a little bit

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.490 
out at and then we just go a little bit
down<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.490> turn<00:03:19.670> left<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.930> cut<00:03:21.170> right<00:03:21.350> into

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
down and turn left and cut right into

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.040 
down and turn left and cut right into
the<00:03:21.680> library<00:03:22.040> well<00:03:22.850> now<00:03:23.030> they<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.690> one

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
the library well now they have that one

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.350 
the library well now they have that one
way<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.070> I've<00:03:25.130> drive<00:03:25.340> all<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.820> way<00:03:25.850> down<00:03:26.120> this

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
way so I've drive all the way down this

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.410 
way so I've drive all the way down this
one<00:03:26.570> way<00:03:27.130> go<00:03:28.130> let's<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:28.610> all<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.090> way<00:03:29.120> three

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
one way go let's go all the way three

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.080 
one way go let's go all the way three
corners<00:03:29.720> around<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.110> library<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.700> then<00:03:31.910> come

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
corners around the library and then come

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.270 
corners around the library and then come
back<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.420> front<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.780> like<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.230> said<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.190> much

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
back in front it's like I said that much

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.280 
back in front it's like I said that much
longer<00:03:34.520> but<00:03:34.760> it's<00:03:34.910> an<00:03:34.970> extra<00:03:36.610> traffic<00:03:37.610> light

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
longer but it's an extra traffic light

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040 
longer but it's an extra traffic light
and<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.250> three<00:03:40.550> it's<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.940> four-way<00:03:41.450> you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
and it's a three it's a four-way you

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.920 
and it's a three it's a four-way you
know<00:03:42.170> intersection<00:03:42.830> so<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:44.450> guys<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.720> sit

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
know intersection so you guys to sit

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.770 
know intersection so you guys to sit
there<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.590> not<00:03:45.739> green<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:47.060> just<00:03:47.510> you

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
know a stick-in-the-mud you know it's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.940 
know a stick-in-the-mud you know it's
just<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.150> slows<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:51.080> down<00:03:51.110> instead<00:03:51.830> just

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
just it just slows you down instead just

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.630 
just it just slows you down instead just
