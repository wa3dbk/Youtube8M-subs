cool pattern that I kind of developed in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.750 
cool pattern that I kind of developed in
the<00:00:31.790> last<00:00:32.029> year<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.980> sounds<00:00:34.220> really<00:00:34.490> good

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
the last year so it sounds really good

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.970 
the last year so it sounds really good
with<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:34.970> variety<00:00:35.240> of<00:00:35.510> chords<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.320> I'll<00:00:36.800> show

relatively low action don't try to do

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.610 
relatively low action don't try to do
this<00:02:13.580> on<00:02:13.730> old<00:02:14.150> Martin<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.170> setup<00:02:15.500> for

this on old Martin the setup for

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.589 
this on old Martin the setup for
bluegrass<00:02:16.040> guys<00:02:16.250> because<00:02:16.819> it'll<00:02:17.330> be<00:02:17.420> really

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
bluegrass guys because it'll be really

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.960 
bluegrass guys because it'll be really
tricky<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.230> also<00:02:18.769> doesn't<00:02:19.069> sound<00:02:19.430> as<00:02:19.670> good<00:02:19.819> on

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
tricky it also doesn't sound as good on

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.570 
tricky it also doesn't sound as good on
nylon<00:02:20.480> string<00:02:20.720> guitars<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.349> steel<00:02:21.890> strings<00:02:22.280> so

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
nylon string guitars as steel strings so

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030 
nylon string guitars as steel strings so
anyway<00:02:23.480> we<00:02:23.629> have<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.260> click<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.830> okay

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
anyway we have this this click here okay

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.760 
anyway we have this this click here okay
and<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.340> comes<00:02:25.549> after<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.790> that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770

the<00:02:32.280> next<00:02:32.580> step<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.940> using<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> ring<00:02:33.510> finger

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the next step is using the ring finger

the next step is using the ring finger
to<00:02:34.050> play<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.350> high<00:02:34.500> E<00:02:34.530> string<00:02:37.820> now<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.880> might

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.630 

okay<00:03:35.500> now<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.890> chord<00:03:36.159> progression<00:03:36.189> we're

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
okay now this chord progression we're

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.190 
okay now this chord progression we're
going<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.819> use<00:03:36.939> in<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.209> song<00:03:37.390> after<00:03:37.629> this<00:03:37.959> goes

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
like this the B minor 11 followed by C

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.610 
like this the B minor 11 followed by C
at<00:03:41.110> 9

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
at 9

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.170 
at 9
common<00:03:43.340> core<00:03:43.549> okay<00:03:43.879> here<00:03:44.870> here<00:03:45.680> open<00:03:46.670> G<00:03:46.909> and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
to go to g6 which is just moving these

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.059 
to go to g6 which is just moving these
two<00:03:52.519> down<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.720> 3rd<00:03:54.019> fret<00:03:54.290> low<00:03:54.590> E<00:03:54.620> string

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
two down to the 3rd fret low E string

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.660 
two down to the 3rd fret low E string
and<00:03:55.280> 2nd<00:03:55.790> fret<00:03:55.909> here<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:58.400> we're<00:03:58.580> going

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
and 2nd fret here and then we're going

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.850 
and 2nd fret here and then we're going
to<00:03:58.730> follow<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.239> by<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.959> standard<00:04:00.319> E<00:04:00.590> minor

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
to follow it up by a standard E minor

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:11.230 
to follow it up by a standard E minor
chord<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:02.420> once<00:04:02.659> again

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.670 

okay<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.540> go<00:04:12.780> through<00:04:12.990> these<00:04:13.140> very

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
okay and you can go through these very

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:27.159 
okay and you can go through these very
slowly

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.570 

now<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.229> thumb<00:04:28.530> always<00:04:28.740> follows<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> base

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
now the thumb always follows the base

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.100 
now the thumb always follows the base
note<00:04:29.820> for<00:04:30.090> example<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.479> first<00:04:30.690> two<00:04:30.840> chords

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
note for example the first two chords

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.200 
note for example the first two chords
the<00:04:31.410> root<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.160> string<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.000> last

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
the root is on the a string and the last

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.000 
the root is on the a string and the last
two<00:04:33.419> chords<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.960> G<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.440> E<00:04:34.470> minor<00:04:34.800> the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
two chords the G and the E minor the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.500 
two chords the G and the E minor the
root<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.639> sixth<00:04:35.940> string<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.330> that's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
root is on the sixth string so that's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.960 
root is on the sixth string so that's
where<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.720> have<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.870> play<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.260> note

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:05:01.210 

okay<00:04:43.970> here<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.330> quick

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.080 

so<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.250> hope<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:02.760> somewhat

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
so I hope that was somewhat

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.480 
so I hope that was somewhat
understandable<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.110> I'm<00:05:05.040> going<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.340> show

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
understandable to you I'm going to show

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.070 
understandable to you I'm going to show
you<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.640> tune<00:05:05.910> now<00:05:06.090> where<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.360> use<00:05:06.630> this<00:05:06.810> pattern

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
you a tune now where I use this pattern

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.740 
you a tune now where I use this pattern
