knowledge<00:05:50.240> really<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.270> really<00:05:51.570> think<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:52.080> year

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
knowledge really I really think a year

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.750 
knowledge really I really think a year
from<00:05:52.440> now<00:05:52.500> would<00:05:52.740> be<00:05:52.860> hard<00:05:53.100> to<00:05:53.130> get<00:05:53.310> food<00:05:53.550> and

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
from now would be hard to get food and

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.159 
from now would be hard to get food and
really<00:05:53.910> three<00:05:54.210> years<00:05:54.390> from<00:05:54.510> now<00:05:56.810> it'll<00:05:57.810> take

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
really three years from now it'll take

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.070 
really three years from now it'll take
more<00:05:58.500> than<00:05:58.560> one<00:05:59.130> ounce<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.850> gold<00:06:00.090> three<00:06:00.840> years

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
more than one ounce of gold three years

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.300 
more than one ounce of gold three years
from<00:06:01.169> now<00:06:01.320> three<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.740> four<00:06:01.919> years<00:06:01.950> from<00:06:02.160> now

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
from now three to four years from now

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.520 
from now three to four years from now
i'm<00:06:02.700> guesstimating<00:06:03.169> because<00:06:04.169> I<00:06:04.230> putting<00:06:04.470> a

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
i'm guesstimating because I putting a

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.290 
i'm guesstimating because I putting a
lot<00:06:04.680> of<00:06:04.710> things<00:06:04.860> together<00:06:05.070> here<00:06:05.490> obviously

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
lot of things together here obviously

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.030 
lot of things together here obviously
unconventionally<00:06:07.200> but<00:06:07.380> i<00:06:07.410> would<00:06:07.620> say<00:06:07.770> three

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
unconventionally but i would say three

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.970 
unconventionally but i would say three
and<00:06:08.130> after<00:06:08.370> four<00:06:08.610> years<00:06:08.760> from<00:06:08.940> now<00:06:09.590> maybe<00:06:10.590> five

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
and after four years from now maybe five

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.880 
and after four years from now maybe five
maybe<00:06:11.760> sooner<00:06:12.210> it's<00:06:12.990> all<00:06:13.230> this<00:06:13.710> is

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
maybe sooner it's all this is

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.470 
maybe sooner it's all this is
event-driven<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:17.000> don't<00:06:18.000> think<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.270> will<00:06:18.360> be

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
event-driven I don't think you will be

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.200 
event-driven I don't think you will be
able<00:06:18.510> to<00:06:18.690> buy<00:06:18.870> a<00:06:19.200> bucket<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.800> wheat<00:06:20.010> with<00:06:20.970> a

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
gold coin which the gold coin will be up

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.940 
gold coin which the gold coin will be up
to<00:06:24.180> you<00:06:24.360> know<00:06:24.590> three<00:06:25.590> or<00:06:25.620> four<00:06:25.770> or<00:06:25.830> five

to you know three or four or five
thousand<00:06:26.340> by<00:06:26.400> then<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:26.730> you<00:06:26.820> won't<00:06:27.000> be<00:06:27.150> able<00:06:27.240> to

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
thousand by then so you won't be able to

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.580 
thousand by then so you won't be able to
buy<00:06:27.450> a<00:06:27.480> bucket<00:06:27.750> of<00:06:27.960> weed<00:06:28.110> for<00:06:28.320> three<00:06:28.470> or<00:06:28.560> four
