compared to my g shock this is a pretty
big<00:02:24.270> device<00:02:24.950> considering<00:02:25.950> what's<00:02:26.160> built

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
big device considering what's built

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.460 
big device considering what's built
inside<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.390> might<00:02:27.570> think<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.050> big<00:02:28.260> or

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.560 
inside you might think that it's big or
not<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.010> done<00:02:29.370> let's<00:02:29.580> find<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.540> is

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
not but done let's find out so this is

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.850 
not but done let's find out so this is
this<00:02:30.780> main<00:02:30.990> screen<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.290> course<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.710> can

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
this main screen of course you can

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.440 
this main screen of course you can
customize<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.490> by<00:02:32.580> tapping<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.030> holding<00:02:33.090> on

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
customize it by tapping and holding on

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.790 
customize it by tapping and holding on
it<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:33.840> we're<00:02:33.960> not<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.320> get<00:02:34.440> into<00:02:34.590> that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it but we're not going to get into that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.530 
it but we're not going to get into that
because<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.030> watch<00:02:36.150> faces

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
because you know all of the watch faces

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.200 
because you know all of the watch faces
are<00:02:36.660> pretty<00:02:36.870> much<00:02:37.160> ugly<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.850> swipe<00:02:39.030> from

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
are pretty much ugly you can swipe from

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.840 
are pretty much ugly you can swipe from
bottom<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.660> top<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:40.260> launch<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.130> app<00:02:41.310> launcher

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
bottom to top to launch the app launcher

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.890 
bottom to top to launch the app launcher
over<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.340> apps<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:45.180> you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
over here you can have the apps or you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.880 
over here you can have the apps or you
can<00:02:46.080> go<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.230> recent<00:02:46.710> apps<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> Tizen<00:02:49.800> OS

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
can go to recent apps this is a Tizen OS

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
can go to recent apps this is a Tizen OS
so<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.430> has<00:02:50.580> pretty<00:02:50.790> much<00:02:51.000> everything<00:02:51.360> that

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
five different widgets so you can do

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.280 
five different widgets so you can do
that<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:36.300> an<00:03:36.570> important<00:03:36.930> function<00:03:37.019> you

keyboards on the messages so and auto

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.940 
keyboards on the messages so and auto
correction<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.720> actually<00:03:43.080> pretty<00:03:43.230> good<00:03:43.410> let's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
correction is actually pretty good let's

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.110 
correction is actually pretty good let's
say<00:03:44.100> hello<00:03:45.080> this<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:49.190> ok<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.489> didn't<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
but most of the auto correction work

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.860 
but most of the auto correction work
pretty<00:03:55.050> good<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:57.170> watch<00:03:59.720> there<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.810> go

you might not want to do that the
bluetooth<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:45.030> most<00:04:45.300> battery<00:04:45.630> efficient

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930

bluetooth is the most battery efficient
way<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.230> doing<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:48.180> has<00:04:48.510> a<00:04:48.720> lot<00:04:48.960> of

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
way of doing it so it has a lot of

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.260 
way of doing it so it has a lot of
functions<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.890> definitely<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> lot

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
functions and it definitely is a lot

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.420 
functions and it definitely is a lot
more<00:04:51.480> than<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.960> SmartWatch<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:52.620> again
