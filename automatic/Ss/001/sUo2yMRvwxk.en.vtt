00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:39.980 
um you know all of their teammates keep
running<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.479> building<00:01:39.780> because

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
running up to this building because

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
running up to this building because
there<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.590> no<00:01:40.770> other<00:01:40.859> way<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.549> either

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
there really is no other way you either

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.010 
there really is no other way you either
run<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.179> building<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
run up to the building or go on the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.779 
run up to the building or go on the
other<00:01:43.170> side<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.249> other<00:01:44.579> route

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
other side of the on the other route

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.179 
other side of the on the other route
which<00:01:45.359> is<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> other<00:01:45.689> building<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.039> can

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
which is the other building and you can

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.279 
which is the other building and you can
either<00:01:47.310> pick<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.090> choose<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.719> what<00:01:49.109> they<00:01:49.229> did

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
either pick or choose so what they did

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.020 
either pick or choose so what they did

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
they're all coming through here and you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
they're all coming through here and you
know<00:01:51.119> I'll<00:01:51.270> kill<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> pick<00:01:51.840> them<00:01:51.960> off<00:01:52.109> like

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
know I'll kill and pick them off like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
know I'll kill and pick them off like
you<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.159> sneak<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.579> head<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:53.969> bit

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you know sneak my head out a little bit

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
you know sneak my head out a little bit
and<00:01:54.390> kill<00:01:54.570> them<00:01:54.719> deep<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.320> their<00:01:55.439> spawn<00:01:55.679> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and kill them deep in their spawn so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.559 
and kill them deep in their spawn so
that's<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.490> guys<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.479> know

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
that's what you guys want to do you know

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:58.910 
that's what you guys want to do you know
it's<00:01:57.749> really<00:01:57.899> easy<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.619> kills

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's really easy to get all these kills

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's really easy to get all these kills
especially<00:01:59.369> rate<00:01:59.579> domination<00:02:00.119> since<00:02:00.359> when

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
especially rate domination since when

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.239 
especially rate domination since when
you<00:02:00.719> spawn<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.409> isn't<00:02:01.710> anywhere<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
you spawn there really isn't anywhere to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.760 
you spawn there really isn't anywhere to
go<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.149> spawn<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.109> only<00:02:04.560> two

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
go when you spawn there's like only two

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.580 
go when you spawn there's like only two
different<00:02:05.280> routes<00:02:05.460> where<00:02:05.819> to<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
different routes where to go so you it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.230 
different routes where to go so you it's
like<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> 50-50<00:02:08.310> chance<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.729> don't<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.179> way

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
like a 50-50 chance we don't go that way

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.059 
like a 50-50 chance we don't go that way
then<00:02:09.539> they'll<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.080> way<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.860> all

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
then they'll go this way and not all

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.620 
then they'll go this way and not all
we're<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> same<00:02:11.880> way<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
we're going to go the same way so it's a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630 
we're going to go the same way so it's a
lot<00:02:12.780> easier<00:02:12.900> make<00:02:13.770> sure<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.980> guys<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.130> don't

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
lot easier make sure you guys I don't

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.970 
lot easier make sure you guys I don't
you<00:02:15.240> know<00:02:15.270> die<00:02:15.690> make<00:02:16.230> sure<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.560> ghost<00:02:16.800> on

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you know die make sure you have ghost on

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.770 
you know die make sure you have ghost on
in<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> address<00:02:17.550> on<00:02:17.700> spark<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.660> can

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
in the address on spark so you can

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.240 
in the address on spark so you can
always<00:02:18.930> keep<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.800> their<00:02:19.920> feet<00:02:20.130> and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
always keep them on their feet and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
always keep them on their feet and
guessing<00:02:20.550> where<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:20.819> are<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.630> spot<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
guessing where they are and this spot is

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.720 
guessing where they are and this spot is
a<00:02:22.230> really<00:02:22.500> good<00:02:22.680> good<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:23.610> can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
a really good good on because you can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.839 
a really good good on because you can
easily<00:02:23.940> climb<00:02:24.299> up<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.599> stairs<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.830> jump<00:02:26.760> out

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
easily climb up the stairs and jump out

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.220 
easily climb up the stairs and jump out
the<00:02:27.000> window<00:02:27.030> if<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.360> get<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.900> get

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the window if you get if you get

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.540 
the window if you get if you get
overwhelmed<00:02:28.650> or<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:28.980> easily<00:02:29.099> just<00:02:29.370> run

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
overwhelmed or you can easily just run

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.160 
overwhelmed or you can easily just run
backwards<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.180> run<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> flight<00:02:30.720> beat<00:02:30.959> where

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
backwards or run the flight beat where

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.020 
backwards or run the flight beat where
there's<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.440> ton<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.680> head<00:02:31.890> glitching<00:02:32.099> spots<00:02:32.459> so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
there's a ton of head glitching spots so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.160 
there's a ton of head glitching spots so
it's<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.269> really<00:02:33.390> good<00:02:33.569> area<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> math<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it's a really good area the math you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.210 
it's a really good area the math you
guys<00:02:34.319> should<00:02:34.470> definitely<00:02:34.620> try<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.040> out<00:02:35.190> if

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
guys should definitely try it out if

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.009 
guys should definitely try it out if
you're<00:02:35.430> not<00:02:35.610> feeling<00:02:35.940> great<00:02:36.239> too<00:02:36.629> much<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
you're not feeling great too much of the

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.780 
you're not feeling great too much of the
map<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.799> sometimes<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> field<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
map I know sometimes on a field of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.339 
map I know sometimes on a field of
Matthew<00:02:39.060> much<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:39.599> said<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:40.170> this

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
Matthew much so I just said in this

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.130 
Matthew much so I just said in this
corner<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.549> just<00:02:41.790> do<00:02:41.909> this<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.049> a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
corner and I just do this and it's not a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.449 
corner and I just do this and it's not a
really<00:02:43.349> good<00:02:43.500> way<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> lot<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.159> kills

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
really good way to get a lot of kills

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.500 
really good way to get a lot of kills
because<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.879> know<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.330> keep

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
because you know you have to keep

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.059 
because you know you have to keep
constantly<00:02:45.989> keep<00:02:46.200> moving<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.620> cycling

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
constantly keep moving and cycling

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.740 
constantly keep moving and cycling
through<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> map<00:02:47.489> or<00:02:48.060> they<00:02:48.150> respond<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.599> get<00:02:48.720> a

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
through the map or they respond to get a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.690 
through the map or they respond to get a
lot<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.959> kills<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.099> decent<00:02:50.580> way<00:02:50.640> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
lot of kills but it is a decent way to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
lot of kills but it is a decent way to
get<00:02:50.879> many<00:02:51.120> kills<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.080> worked<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.379> me<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
get many kills and it worked for me so

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.380
