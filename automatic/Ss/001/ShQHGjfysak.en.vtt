apart is that you have steel wheels

rather than alloy wheels all of these
factors<00:03:47.370> added<00:03:47.640> together<00:03:47.820> make<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> car<00:03:48.570> which

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
factors added together make a car which

factors added together make a car which
