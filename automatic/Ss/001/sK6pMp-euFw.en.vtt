00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi to all of you as in this 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.800
 the unboxing of the blu ray of pulp fiction 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:14.630
 I purchased a special edition from 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.240
 a site is basically the blu ray version 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.260
 with the first record the film is the sector 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.260
 disc extra content 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.199
 all in the metal box package 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.610
 started to discard them while saying about 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.550
 pulp fiction and favorite movie in practice 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.920
 anyway I could not make me miss 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.920
 this beautiful blu ray edition 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.570
 I read that there is also the packaging 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 containing a booklet with 13 recipes of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 Tarantine cuisine inspired by genius 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:18.390
 of the stage I don't know what it is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:25.410
 so let's find out together with this the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:31.400
 disc 1 the movie and then lost small 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.400
 booklet in the kitchen with tarantino 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.600
 and this will then see better than what it is 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.940
 treats if something interesting 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:48.370
 I will try to put myself in the kitchen also that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.370
 if the disc 2 instead on the extra contents 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 this is basically my second 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.270
 blu ray purchase 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.230
 the first was just last unboxing of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:22.050
 beccles club is also said to be mixed 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 initially a bit skeptical towards the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 blue ray world though i'm 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.870
 starting to interest, let's say 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.069
 as long as there are editions like 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.730
 this is some of the films I am willing 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.730
 to buy them 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:42.930
 you greeting and blue ray of paul fiction 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.420
 the advice to buy anyway 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.069
 pulp fiction case you have not yet 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.569

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.769
 see him 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.920
 I think it's quentin's video film 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.170
 tarantino even if they are biased because 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.519

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.519

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.090

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.510
 missal django unchained precisely 17 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.489

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.140
 in the salt to see the new film by 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.450
