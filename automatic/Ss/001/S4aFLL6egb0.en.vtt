problem is that blacks at the gamma I

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.530 
problem is that blacks at the gamma I
get<00:01:57.049> my<00:01:57.140> leg<00:01:57.290> transverse<00:01:57.680> now<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.390> which<00:01:59.390> is

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
get my leg transverse now so which is

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.450 
get my leg transverse now so which is
really<00:01:59.570> just<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.049> blue<00:02:00.290> translucent<00:02:01.130> outsole

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460

with black back there

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.420 
with black back there
the<00:02:03.290> reason<00:02:03.470> why<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.619> looks<00:02:03.649> like<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.220> is

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
the reason why it looks like that is

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.800 
the reason why it looks like that is
because<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:04.909> got<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> black<00:02:05.330> background

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
because it's got a black background

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.050 
because it's got a black background
because<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> file<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.340> extends<00:02:07.850> all<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:07.970> way

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
because the file on extends all the way

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.400 
because the file on extends all the way
through<00:02:08.390> there's<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.840> lot<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.080> people<00:02:09.170> don't

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
through there's a lot of people don't

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.559 
through there's a lot of people don't
know<00:02:09.530> I'm<00:02:09.649> sorry<00:02:09.890> I'm<00:02:10.069> explaining<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
know I'm sorry I'm explaining this the

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.910 
know I'm sorry I'm explaining this the
black<00:02:11.780> extends<00:02:12.200> all<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.410> way<00:02:12.530> through<00:02:12.890> like

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
black extends all the way through like

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.710 
black extends all the way through like

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
this whole midsole the Phylon midsole

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.809 
this whole midsole the Phylon midsole
touches<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> ground<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> way<00:02:16.610> through

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
touches the ground all the way through

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.949
