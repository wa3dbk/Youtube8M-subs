00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
have to put them side but you don't have

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.860 
have to put them side but you don't have
to<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.850> side<00:02:06.240> by<00:02:06.360> side<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.690> just

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
to do that side by side you just

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.620 
to do that side by side you just
basically<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.560> stack<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.040> snow

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
basically have to stack up to snow

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.360 
basically have to stack up to snow
blocks<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.960> put<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> pumpkin<00:02:10.770> head<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.040> top<00:02:11.190> of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
blocks and put a pumpkin head on top of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520 
blocks and put a pumpkin head on top of
them<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.940> make<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> snowman<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.630> then

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
them and you make a snowman and then

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.630 
them and you make a snowman and then
they<00:02:13.650> wander<00:02:13.920> around<00:02:13.980> spreading<00:02:14.340> snow

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
