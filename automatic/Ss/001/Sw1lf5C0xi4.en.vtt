only bit about two hours let's go ahead
and<00:00:07.300> pull<00:00:07.479> it<00:00:07.569> up

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.760 

that<00:00:19.130> is<00:00:20.130> what<00:00:20.340> two<00:00:20.490> hours<00:00:20.520> will<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:21.710> all<00:00:22.710> right

I'm going to go ahead and untie the back
drawstring<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:32.340> should<00:00:32.640> allow<00:00:32.820> us

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
drawstring and that should allow us

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.189 
drawstring and that should allow us
access<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.960> interior<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:35.129> as<00:00:36.059> before<00:00:36.570> if

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
access to the interior here as before if

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.689 
access to the interior here as before if
you'll<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.500> lift<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> opposite<00:00:38.520> end

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
you'll just lift up the opposite end

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.240 
you'll just lift up the opposite end
they'll<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.660> come<00:00:39.900> pouring<00:00:40.199> out<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.800> let's

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
they'll all come pouring out but let's

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.900 
they'll all come pouring out but let's
take<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> look<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:41.940> we've<00:00:42.120> got<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:47.670> looks

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
take a look at what we've got it looks

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.229 
take a look at what we've got it looks
good<00:00:49.160> real<00:00:50.160> good

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.630 

mostly<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.480> eating<00:00:54.720> size<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.610> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
mostly good eating size and a lot of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.360 
mostly good eating size and a lot of
them<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.180> larger<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:01.250> what<00:01:02.250> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
them are actually larger than what you

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860 
them are actually larger than what you
catch<00:01:02.610> in<00:01:02.790> your<00:01:02.820> standard<00:01:03.300> minnow<00:01:03.510> traps

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
catch in your standard minnow traps

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.840 
catch in your standard minnow traps
because<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.379> access<00:01:04.830> holes<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.369> trapper

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
because the access holes to this trapper

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:19.190 
because the access holes to this trapper
that<00:01:05.880> much<00:01:06.210> larger<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:17.659> would<00:01:18.659> definitely<00:01:19.049> say

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that much larger I would definitely say

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.730 
that much larger I would definitely say
this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.799> successful<00:01:20.340> catch<00:01:21.260> now<00:01:22.260> I<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.440> see

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
this is a successful catch now I do see

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
this is a successful catch now I do see
some<00:01:22.950> perch<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> end<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> crawfish

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
some perch there in the end the crawfish

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.820 
some perch there in the end the crawfish
tend<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:29.450> collect<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> far<00:01:31.320> end<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> the

tend to collect at the far end of the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.850 
tend to collect at the far end of the
trap<00:01:32.130> where<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> second<00:01:33.510> access<00:01:33.869> point<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.350> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
trap where the second access point is so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
trap where the second access point is so
they<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> caught<00:01:35.490> captured<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
they get caught captured in there the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.340 
they get caught captured in there the
fish<00:01:37.080> for<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.350> most<00:01:37.560> part<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
fish for the most part are on the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
fish for the most part are on the
opposite<00:01:40.740> end<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.430> part<00:01:41.700> away<00:01:41.939> from<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
opposite end this part away from the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.649 
opposite end this part away from the
crawfish<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.200> possible<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:45.090> looks<00:01:45.330> like<00:01:45.509> this

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
crawfish is possible it looks like this

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.090 
crawfish is possible it looks like this
with<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> single<00:01:46.320> trap<00:01:48.380> I've<00:01:49.380> gone<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:49.890> filled

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
with a single trap I've gone and filled

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.789 
with a single trap I've gone and filled
up<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.430> whole<00:01:51.259> minnow<00:01:52.259> bucket<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.650> that<00:01:55.650> was

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
up my whole minnow bucket so that was

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.149 
up my whole minnow bucket so that was
easy

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
