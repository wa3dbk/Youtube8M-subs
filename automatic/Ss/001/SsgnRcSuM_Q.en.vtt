00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.479
 hello friends in this new video tutorial 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.920
 I will explain one of the errors 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:14.190
 that does not commonly happen to us but 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.220
 if in some occasions it can reach 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.840
 be a problem when the track has not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.199
 you have not created the audio file or the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.930
 Exactly waveform with the grid 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 located where is the crux of the song 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.499
 as we can see in this form of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.589
 wave we observe that the grid that are 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:40.379
 the vertical color lines 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:44.129
 white that they are on the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.780
 the kick of the song is not located 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.850
 correct way then how 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.539
 we solve this problem here in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.679
 our tech deck b we observe that the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.589
 grid is outside the outside of the 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.610
 kick then what first we have 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.860
 what to do is 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:07.180
 the advanced options of the decks 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.500
 As you observe here, we open it. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 we head here to grip 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.020
 and hey it's just here in this 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 we dispose of garbage station and now 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.950
 yes again we have the song without 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.380
 no synchronization grid 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 then what I usually do make 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.790
 is to expand and I locate exactly where 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.920
 there is a click 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.450
 of the song if you want we hear a 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.380
 little the track 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.240
 and you can see where the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.869
 Kit extensive song to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.880
 have greater security of the place 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.119
 where I'm going to place it and nothing else is 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.319
 click here to this option that is 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.070
 to place the synchronization grid 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:04.440
 automatically 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.330
 a point or a hold you news is created for 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.880
 initialize the track and but 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.410
 later we can change it 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 simply for that is making another 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.090
 eye that in that same place placing map 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:27.080
 and we let it be 1 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.300
 we erase this mirror that we have 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.020
 and we already see that the grid is not going to 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.700
 occupy any kind of options in 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.710
 our eye and already later we can 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.140
 logically locate the hokies where 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.480
 want without having to use a 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.190
 grid with a hot yum and not 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.160
 waste it 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.980
 and here we see that we can already use 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.770
 our number 1 equal the grid is already 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.900
 located as observed here 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.960
 the same thing we can do with this track 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.150
 this has happened to me several times 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.390
 that's why we should be careful with 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.500
 our tracks before launching them in 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.940
 one in a mix because we can be 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.330
 can present this problem in fact to 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.120
 it has happened to me and on the fly without 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.550
 without waiting for it I had to correct 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.020
 this problem that is very easy 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.980
 the image was simply enlarged a bit 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.950
 of the sound spectrum and placed the grid and 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.230
 I can synchronize my song with 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.450
 greater ease with the others good 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.340
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.720
 of tutorial thank you very much that are 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.720
 all right 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.720
 bye
