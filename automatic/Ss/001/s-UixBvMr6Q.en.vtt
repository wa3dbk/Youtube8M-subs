00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.859 
I thought we could easily trim the ears
to<00:02:02.280> look<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.550> Maleficent<00:02:03.060> torence<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
to look like Maleficent torence so to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.630 
to look like Maleficent torence so to
shape<00:02:07.110> these<00:02:07.289> cookies<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:07.800> Maleficent<00:02:08.280> ones

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
shape these cookies like Maleficent ones

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.430 
shape these cookies like Maleficent ones
I'm<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> cut<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> slit<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.200> top

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I'm just going to cut a slit in the top

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.369 
I'm just going to cut a slit in the top
of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> ear<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:12.540> make<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> wide<00:02:13.020> curve

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
of the ear and then make a wide curve

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.220 
of the ear and then make a wide curve
coming<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.220> slit<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.840> shape<00:02:16.080> is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
coming down from the slit the shape is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
coming down from the slit the shape is
kind<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.500> hard<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.739> explain<00:02:17.099> but<00:02:17.670> hopefully

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
kind of hard to explain but hopefully

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.100 
kind of hard to explain but hopefully
you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:18.510> idea<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> here<00:02:20.989> now<00:02:21.989> I'm

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you can get an idea of it here now I'm

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.270 
you can get an idea of it here now I'm
going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> repeat<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.950> other<00:02:23.040> side

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to repeat this for the other side

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
going to repeat this for the other side
of<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.580> ear<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.019> score<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
of the ear and I like to score out the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.590 
of the ear and I like to score out the
shape<00:02:25.830> before<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.190> actually<00:02:26.430> cut<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
shape before I actually cut it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.310 
shape before I actually cut it
then<00:02:28.500> I'm<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> deepen<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.550> V<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
then I'm just going to deepen the V and

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.360 
then I'm just going to deepen the V and
this<00:02:31.320> will<00:02:31.470> make<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.710> look<00:02:31.890> more<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.250> our

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
this will make it look more like our

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.110 
this will make it look more like our
horns<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:35.070> course<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.430> cut<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> out<00:02:36.020> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
horns and of course just cut it out and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.590 
horns and of course just cut it out and
that<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.270> our<00:02:39.420> nice<00:02:39.660> Maleficent<00:02:40.350> shaped<00:02:40.590> head

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
that is our nice Maleficent shaped head

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.060 
that is our nice Maleficent shaped head
so<00:02:42.600> now<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.170> use<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.470> cookie<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
so now I like to use this cookie as a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.090 
so now I like to use this cookie as a
stencil<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.580> all<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:44.880> other<00:02:45.060> ones<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.890> can

then just go ahead and mix this in since

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.750 
then just go ahead and mix this in since
black<00:03:30.990> is<00:03:31.020> such<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> hard<00:03:31.620> color<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.920> dye<00:03:32.190> you'll

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
black is such a hard color to dye you'll

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.040 
black is such a hard color to dye you'll
have<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.090> add<00:03:33.210> in<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.450> lot<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.930> food<00:03:34.080> coloring

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
now since this icing was a little bit

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.220 
now since this icing was a little bit
thin<00:03:38.610> I'm<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.630> sift<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.990> about

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
thin I'm just going to sift in about

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.410 
thin I'm just going to sift in about
another<00:03:40.470> cup<00:03:40.740> of<00:03:40.860> powdered<00:03:41.160> sugar<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.360> you

another cup of powdered sugar and you

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.540 
another cup of powdered sugar and you
can<00:03:42.630> see<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.900> consistency<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.650> much<00:03:43.890> nicer

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.770 

now<00:03:47.550> I'm<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.880> going<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.090> pour<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.510> into<00:03:48.690> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
now I'm just going to pour this into a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.810 
now I'm just going to pour this into a
piping<00:03:49.080> bag<00:03:49.140> but<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> ziplock<00:03:50.250> bag<00:03:50.460> could<00:03:50.640> work

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
piping bag but a ziplock bag could work

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.190 
piping bag but a ziplock bag could work
fine<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.180> well<00:03:51.710> and<00:03:53.390> now<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.690> set<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.020> ice

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
fine as well and now we can set to ice

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.980 
fine as well and now we can set to ice
our<00:03:55.410> cookies<00:03:56.090> first<00:03:57.090> I'm<00:03:57.330> going<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.600> mark<00:03:57.870> our

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
our cookies first I'm going to mark our
