 wheel well, at least think of it from the wheel 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.030
 already good easy cross takes the fifth 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.030
 place for the usual 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.430
 brainstorm on pvp do not wait well you 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.619
 wanted not macmillan hold the wheel 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.850
 90 percent of the videos send me 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.060
 with mac milan and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.130
 what am I sorry to do well I don't know 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.670
 Of course I picked up smart videos on 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.440
 today I can't take MacMillan for so long 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.590
 very much and very very very very 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.590
 lot 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.600
 remember i told you that macmillan is not 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.330
 will i lie my tastes are specific to you 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 do not understand and do not know why but this one 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.350
 I liked the grinder avalon 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.950
 15 frags guess what the correct term 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.409
 milano 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.690
 Well, there was also a deagle once, but this is not 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.520
 it is considered you want to see the game without 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.860
 macmillana but you play with poppies about us 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.619
 no need so let's make a deal 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.470
 anti-sho sho you take babaskin and take 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.539
 hands Alpi Well okay so let someone 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.550
 will cheytac thing is that you already 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.890
 long ago filled 10 thousand with this weapon 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.679
 why do you take this macmillan okay 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 okay jokes a little bit later than 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.850
 I really liked this video 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.430
 avalon chose one so small 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.810
 shaky little house and decided to protect him 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.720
 there are many exits 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.130
 windows but still he keeps it with all 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.480
 this game it shows quite 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.430
 good accuracy and of well, everything but that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.220
 still need a sniper not well of course he 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.140
 there indiglo good shot fragment of 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.500
 this I said yes yes yes how could I 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.530
 forget damn but soon he is there well yet 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.329
 a little more frags and and all but me already 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.519
 the text ended it than not doing more 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.610
 VKontakte write there distract the pancake like 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.959
 it is connected with the roller but it does 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.049
 everything can turn a funny joke 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.090
 added at the end oh well how cool i am 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.010
 turned out a comedian or 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.180
 Well, I certainly know that you can 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.950
 joke and better 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.420
 oval he is ranked fourth for 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.420
 what does this video end 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.690
 in third position we have a harder so there 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.730
 or drain which makes -11 on d17 and to 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.980
 sorry he loses that's how it is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.510
 In general, only frags can be made and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.920
 lose guess what he doesn't have in hand 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.709
 ear of the other hand 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.319
 This Macmillan however he also chooses 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.910
 imagine the house is somehow strange yes all 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.040
 choose you a house and start there 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.650
 drag you have to try this tactic a 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.080
 suddenly lucky but you need 17 but here 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.330
 nothing complicated just luck and 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.920
 Accuracy is now one too 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.190
 interesting moment when a sniper 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.319
 overturned is about to dext well 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.630
 what else can save in this situation 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.310
 for this whole war and you never 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.230
 pay attention to the weather here 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.230
 look at the sky how beautiful it is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.880
 although yes but why not looking 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.819
 that the sniper makes the enemy he had 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.830
 family children okay okay even 00 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.410
 maybe everything will turn out for the better 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.290
 his side will cure Maurice no medic there 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.420
 Well, let's say that I am here, it was 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.570
 cool triplkill with 2 patrons and he is looking for 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.910
 your very last victim hard rain 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.910
 third place we go further 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.830
 lane nickname death angel barrett bolt 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.640
 vaio rifle clan-war ripus vs 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.560
 empire 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.750
 finally had a chance to see barrett 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.210
 I’m waiting for action I can’t wait until I 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 This beam lead forever for credit 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.950
 currency but what do we see here we 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.530

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.260
 rifle 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.060
 Well, I'll probably always praise her 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.190
 because it's worth playing with her 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.710
 movie, in principle, skill me he is very 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.840
 liked but a little to the first place 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.430
 didn't reach the first place we will have 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.570
 also bolts to 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.570
 but what else 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.100
 Well, the first place is occupied by a shopaholic 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.710
 1597 playing with someone's lump 200 on 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.340
 Shopaholic lanes for the round did 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.080

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.550
