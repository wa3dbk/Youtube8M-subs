00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:21.568
 1/3 of the flows of Kwidzyn. I think that in PÅ‚ock there are not as many fosterlings as in Kwidzyn. 

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:24.948
 We have a slightly different path to building handball 

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.109
 we do not have such funds as the present-day team 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.392
 whom I congratulate on the next victory 

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:32.859
 and I keep my fingers crossed for Europe to continue to rule as they rule 

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:37.385
 We know our place in the array and for now you need to be happy 

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:42.757
 that these youngsters have been trained by a player of last year yet 

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:44.359
 who repeated the success from last year 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.461
 in junior juniors he won the championship 

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:50.038
 now they play with the same junior junior team 

00:00:50.038 --> 00:00:52.537
 reinforced by two or three older ones, he won the championship 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.084
 so you just have to enjoy this training 

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.203
 goes in the right direction and young people are developing properly 

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:06.077
 Here, on this terady, we knew that VTK can not be beaten. 

00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:08.570
 We wanted to make a fight but unfortunately we did not succeed. 

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.646
 Vive is a little more disregarded in our area 

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:21.735
 and we used it. Here it was different ... 

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:27.638
 they left in a different attitude and beat us with 14 goals 

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:30.961
 with us it was better, because we only lost one ... 

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:36.416
 We played on the territory of the rival. As you can see, we only came in eleven 

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:40.620
 with us a lot of injuries and hard matches behind us 

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:45.300
 fatigue is imposed, there are few of us and that is one reason 

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:50.780
 and the second is known that the experience of Vive players is a bit bigger 

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:57.530
 Of course, I'm very happy because today Krzysztof Jozefski and Zeljko Musa came back 

00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:08.810
 and that is the reason for satisfaction. In the first half we played well and attacked and defended 

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:18.860
 in the second half we had no luck in the first 15 minutes 

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:20.400
 because we played well in the attack but worse in defense 

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:27.480
 but of course I thank the players for fighting for 60 minutes 

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:30.960
 because they had a lot of respect for their opponent 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.370
 we prepare the same for each meeting. I get the material from the trainer 

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:42.020
 we watch together and try to put up a defense for the players 

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.450
 We did not have enough people here 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.000
 we played nine people out of necessity on a wheeled position 

00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:54.070
 we played playmates, also what can be said more here 

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:58.380
 I think we presented ourselves fairly well 

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.240
 It is a very nice feeling, I do not hide back after injury 

00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:03.700
 I have not been almost three weeks 

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:05.680
 on the pitch you can see that I was hungry for the game 

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:08.440
 and I tried to give my best today 

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.690
 I hope I did not bring shame 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.860
 [all that's right for the Saturday match?] 

00:03:14.397 --> 00:03:19.040
 the appetites are really very big. Not only for the Saturday match, but it must last until the end of the season 

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:20.400
 why be calm ... 

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:29.500
 we still have to work. You must not be satisfied. We still have to work to become even better 

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:36.250
 No. Before the Saturday meeting against RNL we have another match 

00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:41.070
 Kwidzyn played 6-0, then for a while 5-1 

00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:53.050
 RNL is playing 3-2-1 and it was the difference for which we did not try our attack today 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.610
 It seems to me that from the beginning, we imposed our style of play 

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.160
 This is what the trainer expects from us in every match 

00:03:57.156 --> 00:04:00.000
 we showed that we would dictate the terms 

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:05.580
 so it happened, and over time, we worked out the advantage of minute to minute 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.530
 and we kept it in the second half. There were some light stops, but 

00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:14.320
 It probably should not change the image of the match and we showed that once again 

00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:15.400
 we were just a better team 

00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:17.550
 I am ready for Saturday ....
