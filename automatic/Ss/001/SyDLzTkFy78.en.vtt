 tomás sánchez presents 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.639
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.700
 a very good motorcycle that I have been asked in 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.709
 a group called gta villamor from 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.050
 Now I tell them that the bike is not mine and 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.720
 the owner tells me on facebook if he wants 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.029
 that eliminates the video it leaves them good 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.460
 will show my friend diego how to install 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.470
 Hi, I'm Diego, how is this good? 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.669
 description of the video is downloaded 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.980
 they will keep this compressed file 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.060
 decompress and stay them both 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.060
 motorcycle and ing files 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 1.5 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.170
 this is the alzheimer editor 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.430
 this the file that if they want they read it or 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.430
 if they do not want they do not read it 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.070
 and these are the most important files 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.810
 that we will install at gta san andreas 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.760
