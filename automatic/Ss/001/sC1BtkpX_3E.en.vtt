00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.959
 Collect anise 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.630
 more beautiful than the remarkable Moon and its inherited light 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.779
 more beautiful than the stars 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.469
 the famous places of the night 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.799
 much more beautiful 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.679
 as the parish the appearance of a comet 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.860
 and so far called beautiful than any other rose 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.929
 because Dahlen and my life train every day 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.599
 is the other one 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.109
 it is beautiful but the one that her work had not forgotten ended 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.090
 the most beautiful summer 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.450
 When a day evaporates on the coasts and without power I play it to you 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.770
 pulled your belly 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.050
 he is tired 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.330
 and the last one shortened 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.810
 warn anyway 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.840
 Art also takes in the veil again 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.740
 you do not appear to me anymore 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.950
 and the scene and the St is dominated by shadows of the prince Untermain 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.000
 after all 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 that keeps us warm 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.370
 and wonderful witnesses 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.550
 that I will see again 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.440
 and that I see you again 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.140
 Nothing better under the sun 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.300
 to be under the sun 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.540
 Nothing better to see the state the water and the bird above 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 yesterday flew thoughtfully 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.730
 and below the tables in the save 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.840
 Fri driven 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.940
 come into the world with a shipment of light 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 and to see the perimeter the square of a field test the thousand ex-male 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.620
 country 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.230
 and the dress that did it 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.380
 and then pops 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.090
 Block i and blue 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.640
 beautiful is blue 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.750
 while the Traun walk and bow 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300
 chats remember 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.300
 the zones of luck with the bookmaker my feelings 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 blue coincidence on the horizon 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 and my enthusiastic eyes 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.520
 widen again and blink and burn to live 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.670
 nice collect 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 the dust of the greatest admiration 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 that's why I will not because of the moon and the stars 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 and not because the night is wide with comets and IMI is looking for him 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.809
 but then because of 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:17.349
 and soon endless and like nothing else 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.699
 Bring action 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.849
 about the inevitable loss of my eyes
