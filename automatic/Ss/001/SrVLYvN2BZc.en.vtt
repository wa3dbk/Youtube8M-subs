00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi everyone knew if I'm 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.160
 here for a new early dati video 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.480
 to say what to show you how 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 grow outside where there is none 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 I'm sorry if I'm delayed 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.289
 it's because the sound is nil with 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.609
 strikes that sas eli raz will leave so for 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.240
 that's it you take sums that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.650
 you still have skeletons 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.130
 you put them in your table of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 kraft foods and you do right click and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 there good that you will tell me what it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.110
 serves 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.149
 to make grass at all 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 just because you're going to pick up 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 small seeds called grain 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.960
 of wheat and it serves to go to see my other 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 tutorial if you want to know 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:00.300
 I am like that 2006 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.800
 so I'll put right so we'll go 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.949
 directly to each other rather here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.180
 what is the human bomb 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.159
 the dimension and 5 out of 5 square room 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 and you are going to do anything but 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.890
 limit 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.390
 So you can chew 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 I liked it like that and especially with 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.390
 the psy games did little style after 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.670
 I find a way to share the little guen 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.790
 or aude but forgotten how does he 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.509
 is indestructible while the small 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.330
 diane not so you'll see if he wants 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.759
 promising yours that's normal it does not 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.100
 can not walk a terrace ban was 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.290
 to do outside 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 look I advise you to dig 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.240
 two wells to dig deep like that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.610
 to not destroy talent on Thursday 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.050

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.539
 but that it had destroyed everyone 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.229
 terrestrial it's ugly so much to do 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:02.330
 like that it does not destroy tavannes 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.140
