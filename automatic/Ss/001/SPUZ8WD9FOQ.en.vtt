00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.750
 also spend at the screen 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 It would like to call the rule short 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.500
 event means her break through one 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 Enjoy the first benefactors of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.529
 second program multiplies city 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.539
 Care is often the word 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.080
 reciprocal or reciprocal demolition 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:45.890
 used what the little one is first 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:48.350
 Break because of the value of the second book 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 that would be the core of this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 emission control dividing a book by 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 a book in which in the first book with 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 the keyword of the second book 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.410
 multiplied and we now want to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.730
 a series of examples again 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.700
 substantiate something 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.540
 and also the possible typical ones 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 tasks here in the form of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.570
 Examples 18 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.750
 to give you an example of a first 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 such as hot front 1 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.799
 divided by a drill so nothing 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.790
 special we write the first 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 break again 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 and now we have this first book 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.390
 with the cellar of the second with the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.970
 Relationships 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.270
 niebels you are called times and the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.320
 turn second book upside down 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:53.009
 So he really thinks worth three 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:54.630
 Just apologize 31 and that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.990
 now again results in a multiplication 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.840
 task and thus I get three times 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.550
 a product counter more than 3 by the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.150
 product 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.000
 4 as the first book miles 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.540
 reciprocal or cellar of the second after 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.640
 eat where write down times kicker 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.620
 second counter times counter by 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.380
 Nevermind names as much as possible 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:25.450
 come 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:30.830
 further examples 1 8 divided by 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.600
 Of course you would have to say see here 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.060
 I have that are the three-quarter 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.540
 The Afghans write a night 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.070
 Of course, that's three birds 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.380
 otherwise one would have to write an eight 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.690
 Let's go back this second book is 1200 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.990
 that a puk computational task once twelve 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.930
 through 899 I can cut down so lard 12 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.440
 against the 1 and 12 g 8 does not play 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.690
 roll take gothics 23 would be here 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.170
 four and is equal to cut the four yet 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:11.350
 against it off so the product 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:15.440
 Teller would be a product before 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.540
 2306 a sixth as a result I take 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.459
 such tasks we could not 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.980
 difficulties I prepare take a 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.850
 example something bigger a perfect 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.660
 and then let's go to a few 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.010
 tasks type level that a bit 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.610
 but could also look more complicated 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.610
 just looks like that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.310
 so just fly to the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.650
 Selected pay that the taxes something 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.129
 Anything else stays away 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.400
 the same one I deny the first 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.549
 break with the reciprocal or with the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.590
 gun of the second time was the second 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.720
 already in this club 20 18 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.200
 if you think that you have little on her 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.829
 calculator 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.450
 there you have to knock immediately otherwise 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.380
 you say all right I'm writing this just 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.130
 also push yourself 63 times 1 20 that 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.310
 the product through the product of emma 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.550
 and short no matter in which one 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.550
 sequence 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:47.250
 I do not care about it the first time around 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:53.759
 say Cutback times free 63 through three 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:05:00.629
 while now 21 and 18 through 3 during 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:05:10.470
 So sixth and which others 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:13.770
 reductions more possible 54 useful time 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:18.470
 could you also without further the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.470
 to receive three of the following words 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.800
 18 and the harmony 7 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:38.920
 continue as a short page 37 x 46 x and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.210
 At some point it will probably work 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.330
 So what would 49 36 be like? 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.910
 result on tours 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.580
 so important is that the rolex and 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.260
 no mistakes but that's us 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.800
 All over people can charge us 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.230
 Yes all 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.860
 The important thing is that you know how to treat her 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.980
 going 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.870
 Of course, the goal is the right result 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.740
 but if you always offset that 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.530
 prefer there 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.210
 these are then any consequential errors 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:10.390
 important that the right gear as 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.890
 has properly recorded such 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.400
 special feature in such tasks 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:19.690
 while still performing such tasks in the 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.970
 form that the bridge gives that one 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.910
 So no one has to pay and that one 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.070
 maybe this colon as de 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.380
 mission will be replaced by a break 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.540
 Just make that complicated 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.800
 and I would suggest that you 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.810
 finish first 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.600
 for the whole book again with 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.090
 deal with such task types and 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.350
 have the baked thing ok calculation 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.350
 this is not a problem
