larger scale agriculture and but we do
that<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.720> begin<00:02:35.870> with<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.500> try<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.769> create

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
that to begin with so you try to create

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.010 
that to begin with so you try to create
a<00:02:37.130> little<00:02:37.370> niche<00:02:37.519> market<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.150> everything

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
but you know it's still a tough go if

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.230 
but you know it's still a tough go if
you<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:42.410> sit<00:02:42.620> down<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.830> work<00:02:43.820> things<00:02:44.030> out

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.970 
in and because we're an open-air type
environment<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.409> not<00:03:42.590> acceptable

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
environment that that's not acceptable

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.429 
environment that that's not acceptable
and<00:03:43.599> we<00:03:44.599> ended<00:03:44.810> up<00:03:44.900> having<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.260> pull

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439
