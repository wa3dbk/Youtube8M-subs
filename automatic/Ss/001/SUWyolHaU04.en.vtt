00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.870
 best 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.090

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.630

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.429
 peculiar but I like it a lot is super 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:56.200
 creamy sometimes so creamy that you feel 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:59.030
 as if it were going to melt but it does not happen 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.250

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.110
 I have one that is not a lipstick but 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.850
 I can not call it gloss either 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.690
