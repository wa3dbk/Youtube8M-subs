installed a Wi-Fi router which basically
is<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:50.500> tweety<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.460> Wi-Fi<00:03:51.790> router<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.690> added<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
is a tweety to Wi-Fi router we added a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.610 
is a tweety to Wi-Fi router we added a
little<00:03:53.650> ion<00:03:54.130> battery<00:03:54.580> which<00:03:55.390> basically<00:03:55.930> plugs

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
little ion battery which basically plugs

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.200 
little ion battery which basically plugs
in<00:03:56.740> directly<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.220> wall<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.700> Prius<00:03:57.970> as

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
in directly to the wall so the Prius as

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.300 
in directly to the wall so the Prius as
you<00:03:58.360> know<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.600> hybrid<00:03:58.780> but<00:03:59.380> this<00:03:59.500> one<00:03:59.650> turns

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
you know is a hybrid but this one turns

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.250 
you know is a hybrid but this one turns

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
it into an electric car and so it plugs

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.370 
it into an electric car and so it plugs
into<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> wall<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.580> is<00:04:03.640> about<00:04:04.170> 60<00:04:05.170> miles

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
into the wall and this is about 60 miles

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.410 
into the wall and this is about 60 miles
but<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.710> also<00:04:05.830> uses<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> hybrid<00:04:06.670> battery<00:04:06.700> so

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
but it also uses the hybrid battery so

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.540 
but it also uses the hybrid battery so
in<00:04:08.080> total<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.440> get<00:04:08.560> about<00:04:08.650> 105<00:04:09.190> miles<00:04:09.430> per

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
in total I get about 105 miles per

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.979 
in total I get about 105 miles per
gallon<00:04:13.080> that's<00:04:14.080> Chris<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.130> there<00:04:15.370> seen<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:15.989> we

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
didn't have to cut a hole we put a plug

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.479 
didn't have to cut a hole we put a plug
we<00:04:18.850> put<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.120> plug<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.480> there<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:20.290> know<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.710> you

the inside that boat you know that I was
really<00:04:34.660> particular<00:04:35.080> about<00:04:35.110> was<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.500> we<00:04:35.650> do

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
really particular about was that we do

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.560 
really particular about was that we do
carbon<00:04:36.190> fiber<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.580> through<00:04:36.760> here<00:04:36.910> typically

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
carbon fiber in through here typically

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.900 
carbon fiber in through here typically
it's<00:04:37.750> used<00:04:37.960> for<00:04:38.050> trims<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:39.130> we<00:04:39.250> just<00:04:39.460> did<00:04:39.730> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
it's used for trims but we just did the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.200

whole<00:04:39.940> scene<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.900> whole<00:04:41.650> back<00:04:41.890> and<00:04:42.210> then

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
whole scene and the whole back and then

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.990 
whole scene and the whole back and then
in<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.140> headliner<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:45.130> put<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.370> suede<00:04:45.760> material

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
in the headliner we put a suede material

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.500 
in the headliner we put a suede material
up<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:47.170> it's<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.310> know<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.490> looks<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:49.120> looks

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
up so it's you know it looks it looks

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.030 
up so it's you know it looks it looks
really<00:04:49.810> nice<00:04:49.960> inside<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.770> then<00:04:50.920> we<00:04:51.550> installed

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.650 

this<00:04:55.040> we<00:04:55.370> specifically<00:04:55.910> made<00:04:56.120> this<00:04:56.240> tray<00:04:56.449> for

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660
