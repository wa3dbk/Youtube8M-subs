it will scan and show you all the disks
these<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.650> 500<00:01:23.159> gig<00:01:23.340> disks<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.880> below

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
these are for 500 gig disks and below

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
these are for 500 gig disks and below
that<00:01:24.450> it'll<00:01:24.930> show<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.500> raid<00:01:25.950> array

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that it'll show you the raid array

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.730 
that it'll show you the raid array
configuration<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:27.840> default<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.350> units

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
configuration so by default this units

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950 
configuration so by default this units
in<00:01:28.860> raid<00:01:29.070> 6<00:01:29.400> by<00:01:29.610> default<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.540> most<00:01:30.720> cases

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
in raid 6 by default and in most cases

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
in raid 6 by default and in most cases
people<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.500> run<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.009> drive<00:01:32.220> unit<00:01:32.490> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
people would run it for drive unit in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
people would run it for drive unit in
raid<00:01:32.880> 5<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> change<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
raid 5 so if we want to change that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
raid 5 so if we want to change that
actually<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> first<00:01:35.430> step<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
actually the first step will be to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810 
actually the first step will be to
delete<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.840> current<00:01:37.619> raid<00:01:37.799> 6<00:01:38.070> array<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
delete this current raid 6 array and to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
delete this current raid 6 array and to
do<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> we'll<00:01:39.299> click<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> array<00:01:40.049> 1

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
do that we'll click on the array 1

this

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.770 

now<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.189> rate<00:02:52.340> array<00:02:52.579> is<00:02:52.640> deleted<00:02:53.150> we'll

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
now that the rate array is deleted we'll

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.119 
now that the rate array is deleted we'll
return<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.109> the<00:02:54.290> folder<00:02:54.620> setup<00:02:54.950> page

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
return to the folder setup page

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.039 
return to the folder setup page
automatically<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.120> you'll<00:02:56.510> see<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
automatically and you'll see that the

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.020 
automatically and you'll see that the
four<00:02:57.319> discs<00:02:57.709> are<00:02:57.889> shown<00:02:58.579> these<00:02:58.700> are<00:02:58.819> 500

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
four discs are shown these are 500

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.660 
four discs are shown these are 500
gigabyte<00:02:59.569> discs<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.319> they're<00:03:00.920> individually

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
gigabyte discs and they're individually

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.099 
gigabyte discs and they're individually
assigned<00:03:01.969> so<00:03:02.239> there's<00:03:02.359> actually<00:03:02.510> no<00:03:02.840> rate

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
assigned so there's actually no rate

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.929 
assigned so there's actually no rate
array<00:03:03.379> now<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.189> we'll<00:03:04.310> go<00:03:04.400> ahead<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.549> need<00:03:04.760> to

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
array now so we'll go ahead and need to

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.849 
array now so we'll go ahead and need to
create<00:03:05.389> a<00:03:05.420> new<00:03:05.569> rate<00:03:05.989> array<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.469> that's<00:03:06.590> done

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
create a new rate array and that's done

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.740 
create a new rate array and that's done
basically<00:03:07.579> through<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.790> same<00:03:08.030> process<00:03:08.540> we'll

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
basically through the same process we'll

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.509 
basically through the same process we'll
need<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.959> click<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.439> system's<00:03:09.889> tab<00:03:10.219> and

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
need to click on the system's tab and

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.959 
need to click on the system's tab and
then<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.150> storage<00:03:12.189> subfolder<00:03:13.189> subcategory

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
then the storage subfolder subcategory

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.000 
then the storage subfolder subcategory
and<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.900> will<00:03:15.019> scan<00:03:15.319> for<00:03:15.590> all<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.799> disk

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
and it will scan for all the disk

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.860 
and it will scan for all the disk
information<00:03:16.609> again<00:03:16.939> and<00:03:17.209> we'll<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.599> able<00:03:17.780> to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
information again and we'll be able to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.080 
information again and we'll be able to
create<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.169> new<00:03:18.439> array<00:03:21.370> now<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.519> for<00:03:22.819> drive

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
create a new array now on for drive

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.490 
create a new array now on for drive
units<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.870> actually<00:03:24.079> have<00:03:24.169> the<00:03:24.230> ability<00:03:24.290> to

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
units you actually have the ability to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.679 
units you actually have the ability to
create<00:03:24.680> multiple<00:03:24.919> arrays<00:03:25.430> such<00:03:25.760> as<00:03:25.969> to<00:03:26.269> raid

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
create multiple arrays such as to raid

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.020 
create multiple arrays such as to raid
one<00:03:26.719> arrays<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.590> are<00:03:27.889> separate<00:03:28.280> but<00:03:28.489> you're

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
one arrays that are separate but you're

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.309 
one arrays that are separate but you're
going<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.209> create<00:03:29.389> one<00:03:29.599> large<00:03:29.840> array<00:03:30.109> you'll

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
going to create one large array you'll

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.750 
going to create one large array you'll
go<00:03:30.409> ahead<00:03:30.469> and<00:03:30.560> click<00:03:30.799> on<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.159> array<00:03:31.519> one

option and we'll select which disks we
want<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.639> use<00:03:34.819> so<00:03:35.449> it's<00:03:35.599> scanning<00:03:35.870> for<00:03:36.079> those

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
want to use so it's scanning for those

of those disks pressing apply will move

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.320 
of those disks pressing apply will move
us<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.799> next<00:04:21.889> step<00:04:22.159> and<00:04:22.340> once<00:04:22.789> again<00:04:22.940> I'll

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
us to the next step and once again I'll

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.540 
us to the next step and once again I'll
enter<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.229> four-digit<00:04:24.470> random<00:04:25.039> code<00:04:25.250> just<00:04:25.460> to

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
enter the four-digit random code just to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.950 
enter the four-digit random code just to
make<00:04:25.759> sure<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.180> that's<00:04:26.389> exactly<00:04:26.539> what<00:04:26.900> I

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
make sure that that's exactly what I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.570 
make sure that that's exactly what I
wanted<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.289> do<00:04:27.409> and<00:04:27.919> I'll<00:04:28.039> press<00:04:28.280> apply

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
wanted to do and I'll press apply

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.180 
wanted to do and I'll press apply
they'll<00:04:29.449> verify<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:30.169> number<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.830> basically

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
they'll verify that number and basically

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.920 
they'll verify that number and basically
go<00:04:31.400> through<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> very<00:04:31.729> similar<00:04:32.180> process<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.780> did

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
go through a very similar process it did

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.439 
go through a very similar process it did
when<00:04:33.110> we<00:04:33.139> deleted<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.800> first<00:04:34.070> array<00:04:34.449> so

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
when we deleted the first array so

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.969 
when we deleted the first array so
you'll<00:04:35.630> get<00:04:35.719> a<00:04:35.780> progress<00:04:36.050> window<00:04:36.469> and<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:36.919> will

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
you'll get a progress window and it will

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.770 
you'll get a progress window and it will
add<00:04:37.190> each<00:04:37.370> Drive<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.909> the<00:04:37.940> raid<00:04:38.150> array<00:04:38.419> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
add each Drive to the raid array and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:49.780 
add each Drive to the raid array and
then<00:04:39.020> automatically<00:04:39.590> finish<00:04:39.979> on<00:04:40.159> its<00:04:40.310> own

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.860 

okay<00:04:50.790> now<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.240> raid<00:04:51.420> array<00:04:51.600> has<00:04:51.720> been

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
okay now that the raid array has been

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.310 
okay now that the raid array has been
created<00:04:52.440> we<00:04:52.620> can<00:04:52.860> see<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:54.110> device<00:04:55.110> now

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
created we can see that the device now

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.710 
created we can see that the device now
shows<00:04:55.380> one<00:04:55.920> raid<00:04:56.430> array<00:04:56.670> one<00:04:57.120> with<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.480> three

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
shows one raid array one with the three

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.720 
shows one raid array one with the three
500<00:04:58.170> gig<00:04:58.290> drives<00:04:58.620> worth<00:04:58.920> of<00:04:59.100> data<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.400> then

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
500 gig drives worth of data and then

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.930 
500 gig drives worth of data and then
500<00:05:00.150> gig<00:05:00.510> drive<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:01.080> 500<00:05:01.980> gig<00:05:02.160> drive<00:05:02.430> worth<00:05:02.760> of

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
500 gig drive a 500 gig drive worth of

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.030 
500 gig drive a 500 gig drive worth of
data<00:05:03.090> spread<00:05:03.570> across<00:05:03.780> as<00:05:04.080> parity<00:05:04.440> information

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
data spread across as parity information

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.580 
data spread across as parity information
so<00:05:05.880> we<00:05:05.970> do<00:05:06.270> return<00:05:06.630> back<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.050> folder<00:05:07.350> setup

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
so we do return back to the folder setup

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.960 
so we do return back to the folder setup
area<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.160> can<00:05:08.280> see<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.580> there's<00:05:08.760> no

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
area and you can see that there's no

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.850 
area and you can see that there's no
user<00:05:09.210> shares<00:05:09.660> because<00:05:10.080> we<00:05:10.200> erased<00:05:10.500> all<00:05:10.710> the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
user shares because we erased all the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.310 
user shares because we erased all the
information<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:11.790> very<00:05:11.970> first<00:05:12.290> step<00:05:13.290> that

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
information so very first step that

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.770 
information so very first step that
might<00:05:13.560> be<00:05:13.650> popular<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.370> create<00:05:14.730> a<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:15.270> first

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
might be popular is to create a a first

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.930 
might be popular is to create a a first
chair<00:05:16.170> maybe<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.500> default<00:05:16.950> share<00:05:17.250> directory<00:05:17.790> or

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
chair maybe a default share directory or

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.610 
chair maybe a default share directory or
something<00:05:18.270> like<00:05:18.390> that<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:19.200> can<00:05:19.350> go<00:05:19.470> ahead<00:05:19.530> and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
something like that you can go ahead and

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.470 
something like that you can go ahead and
do<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.190> it'll<00:05:20.310> sign<00:05:20.670> that<00:05:20.880> on<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.330> that

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
do that and it'll sign that on to that

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.230 
do that and it'll sign that on to that
array<00:05:22.020> basically<00:05:22.860> now<00:05:23.010> you're<00:05:23.250> ready<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.030> go

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
array basically now you're ready to go

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.020

with<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.570> new<00:05:24.750> raid<00:05:25.050> array<00:05:25.320> configuration

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
with the new raid array configuration

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.060 
with the new raid array configuration
just<00:05:27.030> like<00:05:27.150> it<00:05:27.270> was<00:05:27.360> out<00:05:27.510> of<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.720> box<00:05:27.900> now<00:05:28.710> when

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
just like it was out of the box now when

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.260 
just like it was out of the box now when
you<00:05:29.160> do<00:05:29.310> change<00:05:29.580> your<00:05:29.850> raid<00:05:30.000> array

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
you do change your raid array

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.360 
you do change your raid array
configuration<00:05:30.480> on<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.080> buffalo<00:05:31.320> NAS<00:05:31.680> device<00:05:32.040> it

configuration on a buffalo NAS device it

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.070 
configuration on a buffalo NAS device it
will<00:05:32.520> automatically<00:05:33.390> start<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.870> raid

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
will automatically start a raid

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.310 
will automatically start a raid

report to you the status as checking and

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.490 
report to you the status as checking and
then<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.670> can<00:05:56.850> determine<00:05:57.150> how<00:05:57.870> far<00:05:58.200> it<00:05:58.350> is

then you can determine how far it is

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.620 
then you can determine how far it is
wanting<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.280> process<00:05:59.730> so<00:05:59.970> here<00:06:00.120> we<00:06:00.270> see<00:06:00.450> the

that scan is is occurring however when
it's<00:06:27.510> done<00:06:27.990> your<00:06:28.890> performance<00:06:29.430> will<00:06:29.550> return

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
it's done your performance will return

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.090 
it's done your performance will return
to<00:06:30.120> normal<00:06:30.510> and<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:31.380> yellow<00:06:31.560> light<00:06:31.770> will<00:06:31.950> go

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
to normal and the yellow light will go

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.500 
to normal and the yellow light will go
off<00:06:32.310> once<00:06:32.640> it's<00:06:32.880> completed

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
off once it's completed
