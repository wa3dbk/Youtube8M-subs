00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.480
 Welcome to Amstel always pixelated crows and me 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.049
 I'd like to thank you for this two-part tutorial 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.389
 a not entirely intended attempt to show how they do effects like this 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.650
 currently in the cinema to see one in 2012 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.890
 can copy with simple on-board means in the Cinema 4d in this first part 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.470
 I want to show you which basic principle can use to see 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.009
 with modern parts of a building or another 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.910
 structure 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.210
 to animate in the next step we want the whole here in this scene 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 to be practically written 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.859
 So let us start by dealing with it as we do 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.490
 Disassemble object into individual parts 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.210
 For this I just want more of a cube object 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 and I flocked parts of this just clicks 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.660
 in Trier Matra Matrei Segments afterwards I was this one 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.639
 Object Rome 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.419
 Professionals among them so sure hardly noticed that we have separate areas here 

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:55.449
 could have been 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.639
 but in my case, do not have to demonstrate once more how they come out of one 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.380
 existing structure to get single segments 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.250
 in the now have this for it 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.180
 Let us change over to the political scientist and select here all the political scientist 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.660
 at the moment all political scientists are the man of the connected 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.230
 That means a single political scientist is rotating directly with several polito and 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.500
 composite 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.670
 But later we need individual elements for Modern MX 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 and therefore we have to divide this object 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.250
 It makes sense to strop the phone 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.430
 that means using the knife tool to trim parts so they can 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.370
 controlled to lie down can put on which an object 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.890
 breaks apart 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.410
 In my case, do it more simply was not going to automatically do it all up 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.460
 Reason this political scientist structure here just disassemble 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.050
 and therefore I want to discount all political scientist Oro the apple 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.580
 Change in the army in the functions goes 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 and choose and I replace the function here 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.090
 With this I can replace individual surfaces 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.759
 and since we all have chosen political scientist and these together with each other 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.810
 are grouped 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.740
 There is the option to keep Kopmann disabled 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.250
 by clicking on OK e 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.659
 and so we now have individual segments within our neighborhood 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 they can control that by just dropping off 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.409
 while 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.270
 and an old look and almost pull on it 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.159
 You see They see 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.709
 that this police and maybe now 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.510
 Now, we actually thank already laying mobile raft and with the break 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.560
 Update work 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.760
 and disassemble this object now 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.149
 because we now have one for the segment 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:31.059
 the trouble with these segments, however, is that they are infinite they are 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.629
 are just audience or 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.899
 how do we get a certain the topics 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.209
 For this we can once the Siegen Ops object here from the crater Mini 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.219
 use 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.919
 in Sirte where none of the dean they set this goal will be tried 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:49.169
 "But this one seems to work with Mo Pandemic right now 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.840
 Anti Dacia not for a special the former 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.499
 they find Maturant in the depot 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.790
 the explosions Stephan the kes the specialty market places 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.249
 this one offers some the trusts ante possibilities 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.799
 So here we are going to postpone price drops 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.459
 and add it to the formats Rezzo 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.719
 This FOMA tour is meant for Prix visit effects and we have to 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.819
 these all the others are happy and subfolders 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.009
 You can already see very nice here in the video pot 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.549
 that in this explosion 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.689
 the one fat is forgiven 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.689
 this fat comes out here 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.009
 the theater 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.109
 fragments 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.009
 you see here is a thickness of ten meters indicated 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.399
 and I can do that here now 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.929
 I might just want to 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.069
 hereby thickness of about two meters 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.069
 otherwise the narrow ones would have elements too strong 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.140
 for something else I need the exploded peaks 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.660
 not at all behind the Artur I go here to demand object and pull 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.219
 the time just zero 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.219
 so that you object is not touched 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.909
 And so that we storm here, they never see anymore 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.209
 because I make this over the red dot here simply out of hand 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.819
 that means we have high 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.979
 here you can insist on a break for a flight 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.999
 which even have to offer 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.979
 because now apart from the growth, we want to of course now with all 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.370
 Robert 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.049
 in which the here 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.329
 switch back 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.860
 they're going to Moguenara 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.330
 Bend each book of objects and place the cube in it 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.779
 the week look back 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.779
 in front of the child object the individual segments 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.289
 and we can now set here GamePro Pieck Prim TAP objects 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.439
 Here the segments are to be resolved 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.300
 and thus the opportunity with any meets goals 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.599
 to access these segments 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.020
 What are we going to do here? 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.289
 Chance to take Pachter 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.639
 then you already see this is going on 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.259
 So here we can trust Hector with his default settings 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.849
 with a position change from 50 to 15 50 meters already on this single 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:09.569
 surfaces 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.900
 which are now simply treated the cloner 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 but at the same time they can adjust the angle a bit 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.539
 And now the whole thing looks quite impressive 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.539
 and now it can only be tested in practice 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.309
 here, too, is learning the book object itself 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.949
 Vania, after all, ears just no coincidence to Twitter 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.940
 and now draw the effect of the random Epic that just look at zero 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.620
 looking to disassemble and had this valley 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.659
 Of course we can now also on this Pocher Pkt 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:47.999
 here 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.800
 Apply Modern MX that means 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.720
 a dynamics calculating animal performed on this crown 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:56.650
 in order to 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.839
 we can then bring the whole collapse here 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.650
 Hom or Mey nothing to add Banz that Pocher PID off 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.650
 where belongs PACS Fritsche Pauli 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.580
 and only one play luck only from 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.119
 to start the dynamics 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.239
 Lutze scene by default already has a charitable 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:18.680
 So you see 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.550
 In principle, America is not that hard 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.129
 because disassemble object 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:27.650
 Of course, this process will be a bit more complex for us now 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:28.619
 counter 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:30.800
 also perform again 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.599
 only that the vines have a skyscraper which should collapse 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.919
 Forces look to it and the collapse of the skyscraper should 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.869
 the collapse of this family home also compete 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.180
 that does not change and Krill look at it 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.900
 have fun with it
