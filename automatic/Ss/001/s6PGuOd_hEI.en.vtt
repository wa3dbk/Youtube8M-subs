think<00:04:02.590> you're<00:04:02.709> on<00:04:02.799> top<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.159> world<00:04:03.310> but

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
think you're on top of the world but

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.160 
think you're on top of the world but
there's<00:04:04.209> really<00:04:04.329> bigger<00:04:04.659> things<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:04.989> life

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
there's really bigger things in life

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.949 
there's really bigger things in life
that<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.489> sort<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.849> get<00:04:07.599> our<00:04:07.750> heads

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
that you have to sort of get our heads

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.080 
that you have to sort of get our heads
wrapped<00:04:08.200> around<00:04:08.349> instead<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.099> just<00:04:09.370> your<00:04:09.790> name

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
wrapped around instead of just your name

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.649 
wrapped around instead of just your name
and<00:04:10.120> just<00:04:10.569> how<00:04:10.739> DNA<00:04:11.739> will<00:04:12.010> be<00:04:12.129> here<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.579> I<00:04:12.879> think

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
and just how DNA will be here is I think

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.520 
and just how DNA will be here is I think
the<00:04:13.930> Lord<00:04:14.169> is<00:04:15.539> we<00:04:16.539> are<00:04:16.630> here<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.959> be<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.109> servants

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
the Lord is we are here to be a servants

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.710 
the Lord is we are here to be a servants
and<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.979> think<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:18.579> we<00:04:18.699> can<00:04:18.880> fully<00:04:19.299> wrap<00:04:19.509> our

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
and I think if we can fully wrap our

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.810 
and I think if we can fully wrap our
hands<00:04:20.109> around<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.500> then<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.949> think<00:04:21.220> will<00:04:21.729> be

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
hands around that then I think will be

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.409 
hands around that then I think will be
perfect<00:04:22.380> i'm<00:04:23.380> neil<00:04:23.860> pal<00:04:24.120> always<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> leader
