00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.129
 which is called the holocaust 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.110
 Part 1 Well start so 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:37.590
 crack let's start some characters 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 may not appear sloppy understandable 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.150
 hello wanderer is this map part of the story 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.030
 lost court and court and fate probably 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.920
 after leaving the temple you went dark 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.339
 eyes you lost consciousness and woke up 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.720
 here the rules are the same mode easy 4 so 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:04.409
 straight peace mode and no light easy 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.740
 sound from us so take us kit 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.660
 all so well let's start what is not dark 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.140
 punching the room quickly I donâ€™t know 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:25.230
 maybe wow damn unexpected tactician 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:32.480
 horse keep parkour i'm not in parkour 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:40.320
 let's see what happens this time 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:44.960
 ok fine by lianam almost hit 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.120
 jumped anything now fix the table 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.590
 okay so do not rush 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.590
 calmly from block to block slowly 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.300
 jump over crawling on whether 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.100
 I wanted to align with normal data 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.489
 parkour 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:14.120
 I'm not very good for this, I pass cards 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.420
 such obviously not played yet for me this 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.640
 new girl 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.920
 but such maps I will learn parkour 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.800
 creeping the table 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:47.920
 somehow all in general really anyone without 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:52.870
 does that hurt that's what we jump over 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:56.820
 birthmarks on the spot yes ok 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.820
 I blocked the 4dita block 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.730
 I can't stand here 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.730
 jump over 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:14.170
 here the devil or she hinders her so I 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.720
 also noticed if close to us is worth it 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.060
 i don't touch 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.370
 most likely because of this now quiet 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.970
 quietly lead everything to the very edge oh oh oh 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:39.370
 yes it was all whether they were to blame 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:41.890
 I will know that's far to jump all so well 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.010
 what do we have there 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.959
 now your prize of there means further 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.500
 crawl or you can always immediately 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:56.800
 for manchego suddenly there is some kind of trap 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.870
 no I will not risk so here we have 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:06.240

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.240

 We were attacked by Tass Slavik 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:51.880
