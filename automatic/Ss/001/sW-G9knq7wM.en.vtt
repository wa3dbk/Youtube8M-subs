now<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.960> pricey<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.740> it's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
now it is a little pricey but it's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.789 
now it is a little pricey but it's
definitely<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.360> investment<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
definitely a good investment and when I
