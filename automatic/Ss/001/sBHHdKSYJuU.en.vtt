00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.770
 in what happens kids like basso 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.990
 gamer again and this time to bring 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.330
 a video in which I show you how 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.750
 you can unlock the grid's trophy 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.850
 in far cry 3 good the trophy in itself 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.890
 nothing is difficult 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.980
 hunt is the location on the map and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.260
 just go there and do it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.210
 I told you about the free fall trophy 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.570
 elements survive a fall of 100 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.110
 meters high it's worth so how do you like 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.200
 I say there it is very easy and simply with 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.220
 the two forms and I show in the video 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.680
 from before there will be nothing more to tell you that 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.610
 there is to pour there but you have to do it 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.610
 in episode 29 of the campaign that 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.400
 flame flying south 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.320
 Not that it is not that there is nothing 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.000
 special just do not open the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.750
 parachute when when they jump off the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.550
 plane and automatically jump and with 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.979
 this is all three the ways of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.080
 make the trophy yes so if it does not come out 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:13.780
 of one test with another and of some 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 way can help there's nothing else we 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.350
 we see in the next a greeting to all 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.350
 see you later 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.960
