00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
so I'm starting my juicing today with a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.190 
so I'm starting my juicing today with a
cucumber<00:00:09.050> Apple<00:00:10.250> three<00:00:11.250> carats<00:00:11.730> two<00:00:12.690> celery

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
cucumber Apple three carats two celery

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.019 
cucumber Apple three carats two celery
stalks<00:00:13.290> with<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.340> leaves<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.590> I<00:00:17.000> guess<00:00:18.000> a

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
stalks with the leaves on and I guess a

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.540 
stalks with the leaves on and I guess a
cup<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.539> spinach<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.710> we're<00:00:19.980> gonna<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.369> how

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
cup of spinach so we're gonna see how

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.500 
cup of spinach so we're gonna see how
this<00:00:20.730> goes<00:00:22.400> well<00:00:23.400> hopefully<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> tastes<00:00:24.330> good

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this goes well hopefully it tastes good

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.450 
this goes well hopefully it tastes good
if<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> may<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> add<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:26.010> apples

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
if not I may have to add more apples

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.720 
if not I may have to add more apples

and just personal preference I cut them

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.459 
and just personal preference I cut them
up<00:00:40.020> into<00:00:40.140> more<00:00:40.500> manageable<00:00:40.620> pieces<00:00:41.480> but<00:00:42.480> i'm

jack<00:01:09.030> lalanne<00:01:09.600> power<00:01:09.960> juicer<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:12.500> we're

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
jack lalanne power juicer and we're

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
jack lalanne power juicer and we're
going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.890> how<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.280> comes<00:01:14.520> out<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.390> only

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
going to see how it comes out it's only

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.740 
going to see how it comes out it's only
allowing<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.470> fit<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:18.000> small<00:01:18.330> cup<00:01:18.600> in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
allowing me to fit this small cup in

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
allowing me to fit this small cup in
here<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.100> starts<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> come<00:01:20.610> out

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

i'm just going to add another cup and
then<00:01:22.049> mix<00:01:22.830> both<00:01:23.070> together<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> taller<00:01:24.330> cup

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659

then mix both together into a taller cup
and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.450 
and
we'll<00:01:26.970> check<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.340> start

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
we'll check it so I'm going to start

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210 
we'll check it so I'm going to start
with<00:01:29.729> pouring<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.750> spinach<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.800> actually

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
with pouring in my spinach but actually

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.270 
with pouring in my spinach but actually
turning<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.760> machine<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.890> fine<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.160> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
turning on the machine and fine in the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:02:30.010 
turning on the machine and fine in the
spinach

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.040 

that<00:02:30.890> come<00:02:31.100> about<00:02:31.220> I'm<00:02:31.580> going<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.500> move<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.800> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
that come about I'm going to move on to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:03:06.070 
that come about I'm going to move on to
my<00:02:36.050> carrot

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.210 

next<00:03:07.080> I'm<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> put<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.860> celery

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
next I'm going to put in the celery

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:55.750 
next I'm going to put in the celery
starts

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:10.860 

now<00:03:56.760> i'm<00:03:56.909> going<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.239> throw<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.689> the<00:03:58.439> cucumber

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.840 

is<00:04:10.959> getting<00:04:11.409> full

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.420 

so<00:04:20.420> I<00:04:20.450> had<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.780> go<00:04:21.500> ahead<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.770> use<00:04:21.860> another<00:04:22.130> cup

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
so I had to go ahead and use another cup

00:04:22.430 --> 00:05:14.129 
so I had to go ahead and use another cup
and<00:04:22.990> last<00:04:23.990> i'm<00:04:24.290> going<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.770> put<00:04:25.160> in<00:04:26.170> my<00:04:27.170> half

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.129 

and<00:05:15.159> that's<00:05:16.159> basically<00:05:16.460> it

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
and that's basically it

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.059 
and that's basically it
I<00:05:18.430> have<00:05:19.430> tasted<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:21.020> does<00:05:21.499> taste<00:05:21.740> kind<00:05:21.860> of

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
I have tasted it it does taste kind of

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.860 
I have tasted it it does taste kind of
good<00:05:22.189> especially<00:05:22.490> when<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:23.240> Apple<00:05:23.569> gifts<00:05:23.780> in

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
good especially when the Apple gifts in

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.830 
good especially when the Apple gifts in
there<00:05:24.020> it's<00:05:24.199> a<00:05:24.229> little<00:05:24.439> bit<00:05:24.530> more<00:05:24.800> sleep

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
there it's a little bit more sleep

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.469 
there it's a little bit more sleep
definitely<00:05:26.840> can<00:05:27.020> take<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.650> salary<00:05:28.310> but<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.419> am

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
definitely can take the salary but I am

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.989 
definitely can take the salary but I am
probably<00:05:29.870> going<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.499> add<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.490> rest<00:05:31.699> of<00:05:31.879> the

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:31.999 
probably going to add the rest of the

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.580 
probably going to add the rest of the
Apple<00:05:32.389> just<00:05:32.689> so<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.930> has<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.080> little<00:05:33.259> bit<00:05:33.409> more

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
Apple just so it has a little bit more

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.339 
Apple just so it has a little bit more
sweetness<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:34.129> it<00:05:34.279> but<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:36.020> doesn't<00:05:36.289> really

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
sweetness to it but it doesn't really

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.980 
sweetness to it but it doesn't really
taste<00:05:36.499> that<00:05:36.710> bad<00:05:36.949> so<00:05:37.449> hopefully<00:05:38.449> you<00:05:38.539> guys<00:05:38.689> try

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
taste that bad so hopefully you guys try

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.499 
taste that bad so hopefully you guys try
it<00:05:39.050> like
