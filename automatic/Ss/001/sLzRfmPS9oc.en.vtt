00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.820
 how are we in another video but 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.069
 now where I go out I already know with my 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.709
 lion shirt look 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.420
 I'm celebrating the championship barely 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.519
 that tomorrow we turn a week 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.820
 we are champions but that's not what 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.590
 video but this is true I'm going 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.830
 showing look what I found is 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.619
 one there is a lot of key a torch of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.109
 minecraft I found it a store that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.030
 it's called goodwin where that store does not 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.860
 they sell specific things are like 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.000
 used or semi or new things but as 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 battered is not very cheap that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.950
 store but you never never know that you're going 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 to find so I found this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.129
 torch I could not believe I swear them 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.770
 for example I bought this iphone there 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.920
 to put the music and it's said it cost me 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.160
 5 dollars and the torch when they believe 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 see cost me $ 6 torch and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.539
 leave it 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.180
 we uncover it and I have it here with 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.260
 open name that I loved to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 see I've found these 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.090
 through minecraft in the games that 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.530
 I'm as surprised to see I am for 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 I'm big, I have a very strong hand 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.560
 big and the torch is barely in my 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.690
 hand does not buy you batteries 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.870
 batteries but this ship is here 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.820
 this is the button and turn on all this 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.200
 is up here this is gray this cafes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.920
 and everything that has been the wood 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 he does not learn and this yes if he turns on 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.510
 the night then he looks very very father here 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.880
 my torch of minecraft is in me 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.130
 I wanted to show them off like I can 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.560
 give away I hope 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.380
 he gave it to her with a condition 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.450
 let me see you can give them away but 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.030
 I would have to see where to buy another 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.840
 because I want another one then if we arrive 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.430
 at 5000 I think if we go get to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.189
 a goal we go as close as 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.160
 we reach six thousand subscribers in order 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:14.660
 of years ending the year and we see if they 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.130
 gave away a torch like this or if a 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.050
 torch like this since we are very 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.530
 father so that they have it there in their 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.180
 fourth and everything so you already know 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.970
 the goal and the only thing they have to do 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.760
 you can share and tell your friends 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.989
 of the channel to like to comment and everything 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.549
 who already know how to do so many 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.470
 thanks see you in the next video 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.470
