drops<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.220> basically<00:00:23.760> three<00:00:23.970> shapes<00:00:24.240> at

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
drops have basically three shapes at

least<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> my<00:00:25.050> mind<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.760> bubble<00:00:27.060> drop

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
least in my mind you have a bubble drop

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.509 
least in my mind you have a bubble drop
which<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> exactly<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.769> says<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.310> it's

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
which is exactly what it says it is it's

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.110 
which is exactly what it says it is it's
a<00:00:29.640> bubble<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.539> sits<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> flatter<00:00:31.439> surface

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
a bubble this sits on a flatter surface

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
a bubble this sits on a flatter surface
you<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.149> running<00:00:33.630> drops<00:00:33.989> where<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:35.190> kind

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you have running drops where they kind

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.950 
you have running drops where they kind
of<00:00:35.550> collect<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> point<00:00:36.840> where

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
of collect and get to the point where

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450 
of collect and get to the point where
they<00:00:37.079> almost<00:00:37.260> want<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.800> cut<00:00:38.160> loose<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
they almost want to just cut loose and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
they almost want to just cut loose and
run<00:00:38.640> down<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> particular<00:00:39.180> object<00:00:40.020> whether

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
run down a particular object whether

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
run down a particular object whether
it's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> flower<00:00:41.219> petal<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> stem<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.300> down

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it's a flower petal or a stem or down

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's a flower petal or a stem or down
the<00:00:42.540> side<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.020> base<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> drip<00:00:45.600> drop

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the side of a base you have a drip drop

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139 
the side of a base you have a drip drop
which<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> classic<00:00:47.550> teardrop<00:00:47.760> that's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
which is just a classic teardrop that's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
which is just a classic teardrop that's
suspended<00:00:48.600> hanging<00:00:49.140> off<00:00:49.289> something<00:00:49.590> just

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
suspended hanging off something just

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090 
suspended hanging off something just
getting<00:00:50.160> ready<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> drop<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> those<00:00:52.949> are

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
getting ready to drop so those are

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
getting ready to drop so those are
basically<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.640> shapes<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
basically the shapes that you have to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.639 
basically the shapes that you have to
think<00:00:55.230> about

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
think about

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.910 
think about
they<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.820> symmetrical<00:00:57.800> everything<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
they are very symmetrical everything is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.439 
they are very symmetrical everything is
balanced<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.059> will<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
balanced and even they will have a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
balanced and even they will have a
shadow<00:01:00.870> underneath<00:01:01.350> other<00:01:01.800> than<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> drip

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
shadow underneath other than the drip

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.100 
shadow underneath other than the drip
drop<00:01:03.059> obviously<00:01:03.660> won't<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.080> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
drop obviously won't because it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.550 
drop obviously won't because it's
suspended<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.830> not<00:01:04.949> sitting<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.400> anything

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
suspended it's not sitting on anything

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.690 
suspended it's not sitting on anything
but<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> put<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> corresponding

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but you have to put a corresponding

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
but you have to put a corresponding
shadow<00:01:08.970> which<00:01:09.240> sets<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.810> gives<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
shadow which sets it up gives it a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.700 
shadow which sets it up gives it a
three-dimensional<00:01:11.100> shape<00:01:11.930> quite<00:01:12.930> often<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
three-dimensional shape quite often in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.490 
three-dimensional shape quite often in
my<00:01:13.860> classes<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.729> students<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.780> which

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
my classes I see students do this which

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.780 
my classes I see students do this which
these<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.280> symmetrical<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:19.549> can't<00:01:20.549> tell

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
these are not symmetrical I can't tell

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.070 
these are not symmetrical I can't tell
you<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.030> many<00:01:21.090> times<00:01:21.479> I've<00:01:21.689> seen<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you how many times I've seen the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530 
you how many times I've seen the
football<00:01:22.439> rather<00:01:23.159> than<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> teardrop<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
football rather than the teardrop this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
football rather than the teardrop this
needs<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.200> rounded<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> bulbous<00:01:26.490> on

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
needs to be very rounded and bulbous on

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.870 
needs to be very rounded and bulbous on
the<00:01:27.000> bottom<00:01:27.330> end<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:28.290> pointed<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the bottom end and not pointed so the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
the bottom end and not pointed so the
shape<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> critical<00:01:30.689> once<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> shape

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
shape is critical once you get the shape

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.960 
shape is critical once you get the shape
right<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.700> halfway<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:34.880> what<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
right you're halfway there what it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.700

use some medium as well if I chose to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
use some medium as well if I chose to
but<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> center<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.280> work<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.460> fine<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
but the center will work just fine this

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
well but notice I'm sending this paint

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.540 
well but notice I'm sending this paint
down<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> palette<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.310> getting<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
down on the palette and getting it to a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.540 
down on the palette and getting it to a
thin<00:02:09.060> consistency<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.259> I'm<00:02:10.950> rolling<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
thin consistency and I'm rolling the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.369 
thin consistency and I'm rolling the
brush<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> point<00:02:12.300> not<00:02:12.569> too<00:02:12.780> much<00:02:12.930> paint<00:02:13.230> in

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
brush to a point not too much paint in

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.710 
brush to a point not too much paint in
the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.720 
the
ruch<00:02:13.990> right<00:02:14.200> now<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:15.160> enough<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.490> bring<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
ruch right now just enough to bring it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.360 
ruch right now just enough to bring it
to<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> really<00:02:16.330> nice<00:02:16.510> point<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.100> have<00:02:18.130> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
to a really nice point and you have to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.300 
to a really nice point and you have to
determine<00:02:18.820> where<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.060> want<00:02:19.300> these<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.690> go

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
determine where you want these to go

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.860 
determine where you want these to go
I'm<00:02:21.310> thinking<00:02:21.820> maybe<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.510> flatter

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
I'm thinking maybe on this flatter

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.810 
I'm thinking maybe on this flatter
surface<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:23.920> particular<00:02:24.160> pedal

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
surface of this one particular pedal

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.770 
surface of this one particular pedal
right<00:02:24.940> here<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.180> going<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.360> put<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> bubble

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
right here I'm going to put a bubble

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.730 
right here I'm going to put a bubble
drop<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.850> draw<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.300> thinnest<00:02:29.020> skinniest

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
drop so I I draw the thinnest skinniest

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.460 
drop so I I draw the thinnest skinniest
possible<00:02:30.340> line<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:34.110> now<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.320> looks

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
possible line that I can now that looks

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.980 
possible line that I can now that looks
very<00:02:35.680> hard<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:37.120> okay<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.450> have<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.690> hard

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
very hard it's okay to have a hard

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.390 
very hard it's okay to have a hard
outside<00:02:38.200> edge<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:38.740> long<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.250> got<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
outside edge as long as you got the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.100 
outside edge as long as you got the
shape<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.060> symmetrical<00:02:40.540> I'm<00:02:40.810> gonna

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
shape right it's symmetrical I'm gonna

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.860 
shape right it's symmetrical I'm gonna
wipe<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.470> brush<00:02:41.680> off<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.880> if<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.360> take<00:02:43.630> this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
wipe the brush off and if I take this

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.949 
wipe the brush off and if I take this
brush<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.530> just<00:02:45.010> tickle<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> inside<00:02:46.420> edge<00:02:46.780> of

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
brush and just tickle the inside edge of

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.420 
brush and just tickle the inside edge of
the<00:02:47.020> line<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.530> there's<00:02:47.709> not<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.890> hard<00:02:48.190> line<00:02:48.400> on

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
the line so there's not a hard line on

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.910 
the line so there's not a hard line on
the<00:02:48.700> inside<00:02:48.880> that's<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.630> key<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.110> can<00:02:50.740> have<00:02:50.890> a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the inside that's the key I can have a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.440 
the inside that's the key I can have a
hard<00:02:51.160> line<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.610> outside<00:02:52.000> edge<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
hard line on the outside edge but you

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.550 
hard line on the outside edge but you
don't<00:02:52.600> want<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.080> inside<00:02:53.320> see<00:02:53.470> how

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
don't want one on the inside see how

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.600 
don't want one on the inside see how
that<00:02:53.709> makes<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.070> look<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> little<00:02:54.430> more

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
that makes it look a little more

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.430 
that makes it look a little more
transparent<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.390> little<00:02:55.570> softer<00:02:55.990> I'm

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
transparent and a little softer I'm

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.290 
transparent and a little softer I'm
gonna<00:02:56.770> scoop<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> little<00:02:57.850> bit<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.060> paint

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
gonna scoop up a little bit of paint

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.850 
gonna scoop up a little bit of paint
right<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.930> point<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.320> that<00:03:00.150> brush<00:03:01.150> and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
right on the point of that brush and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.170 
right on the point of that brush and
I'll<00:03:02.860> see<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.100> lights<00:03:03.400> kind<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.700> come<00:03:03.820> while<00:03:04.150> I

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I'll see the lights kind of come while I

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.280 
I'll see the lights kind of come while I
can<00:03:04.390> tell<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.780> painting<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.080> lights

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
can tell in this painting the lights

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.449 
can tell in this painting the lights
coming<00:03:05.470> from<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.770> right<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.370> way

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
coming from the right because of the way

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.460 
coming from the right because of the way
the<00:03:06.610> stems<00:03:06.850> are<00:03:07.060> highlighted<00:03:07.480> I'm<00:03:07.900> gonna<00:03:08.260> put

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470

a<00:03:08.500> little<00:03:08.709> dot<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> highlight<00:03:09.550> right<00:03:10.300> on<00:03:10.480> that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
a little dot a highlight right on that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.949 
a little dot a highlight right on that
leading<00:03:10.990> side<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.280> will<00:03:13.090> rinse<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.510> brush<00:03:13.720> out

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
leading side I will rinse the brush out

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.320 
leading side I will rinse the brush out
anything<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.950> red<00:03:15.220> would<00:03:16.150> have<00:03:16.300> a

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
anything on the red would have a

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.860 
anything on the red would have a
stronger<00:03:17.050> red<00:03:17.440> deeper<00:03:18.220> red<00:03:18.400> shadow<00:03:18.870> cast

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.830 
just a little sense of a cast shadow
where<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.850> bubble<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:31.239> actually<00:03:31.570> sitting

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
where the bubble is actually sitting

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.270 
where the bubble is actually sitting
you'll<00:03:32.080> see<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.739> looks<00:03:32.950> like<00:03:33.100> it's

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
you'll see that it looks like it's

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.570 
you'll see that it looks like it's
sitting<00:03:33.489> right<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:33.910> there<00:03:34.830> very<00:03:35.830> simple<00:03:36.310> now

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
sitting right out there very simple now

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.400 
sitting right out there very simple now
that<00:03:36.760> drop<00:03:37.180> might<00:03:37.480> be<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> little<00:03:37.900> bit<00:03:38.080> big<00:03:38.380> for

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
that drop might be a little bit big for

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.229 
that drop might be a little bit big for
the<00:03:38.709> size<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.220> scale<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.790> particular

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
the size and scale of that particular

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.810 
the size and scale of that particular
painting<00:03:40.510> but<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.810> want<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.230> see<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:41.890> you

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
painting but I want you to see it so you

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.340 
painting but I want you to see it so you
want<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.060> think<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.390> size<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.110> scale

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
want to think of the size of the scale

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.479 
want to think of the size of the scale
and<00:03:44.560> proportion<00:03:44.950> as<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:47.489> that's

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
and proportion as you do this and that's

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.810 
and proportion as you do this and that's
a<00:03:48.640> bubble<00:03:48.910> drop<00:03:50.040> I'm<00:03:51.040> gonna<00:03:51.250> I've<00:03:51.459> rinse<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
a bubble drop I'm gonna I've rinse the

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.840 
a bubble drop I'm gonna I've rinse the
brush<00:03:51.940> out<00:03:52.209> I'm<00:03:52.330> going<00:03:52.540> back<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:52.959> white

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
brush out I'm going back to that white

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.880 
brush out I'm going back to that white
which<00:03:54.850> is<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.269> spin<00:03:55.630> down<00:03:55.900> titanium<00:03:56.590> zinc

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
which is just spin down titanium zinc

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.930 
which is just spin down titanium zinc
white<00:03:57.840> right<00:03:58.840> over<00:03:59.110> here<00:03:59.489> coming<00:04:00.489> down<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
white right over here coming down the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.220 
white right over here coming down the
stem<00:04:01.209> I'm<00:04:01.390> going<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.600> say<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.930> there's<00:04:02.080> one

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
stem I'm going to say that there's one

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.140 
stem I'm going to say that there's one
that's<00:04:02.380> actually<00:04:02.860> kind<00:04:03.070> of<00:04:03.160> running<00:04:03.549> down<00:04:03.580> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
that's actually kind of running down the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.880 
that's actually kind of running down the
length<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> stem<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.110> it's<00:04:05.470> kind<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.830> a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
length of the stem is it's kind of a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.199 
length of the stem is it's kind of a
teardrop<00:04:06.790> shape<00:04:08.310> it's<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.400> cross<00:04:09.670> between<00:04:09.700> that

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
teardrop shape it's a cross between that

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.720 
teardrop shape it's a cross between that
teardrop<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:12.010> drip<00:04:12.250> drop<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
teardrop and the drip drop and the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.090 
teardrop and the drip drop and the
running<00:04:12.910> drop<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.450> showed<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.720> earlier

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
running drop that I showed you earlier

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.020 
running drop that I showed you earlier
kind<00:04:15.100> of<00:04:15.160> like<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.370> but<00:04:15.519> it's<00:04:15.670> off<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.940> the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
kind of like this but it's off to the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.060 
kind of like this but it's off to the
sides<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.570> running<00:04:16.989> down<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.260> side<00:04:18.900> so

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
sides it's running down the side so

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.760 
sides it's running down the side so
again<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.100> put<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.459> shape<00:04:21.700> on<00:04:22.380> wipe<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.560> brush

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
again I put the shape on wipe the brush

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.250 
again I put the shape on wipe the brush
off<00:04:24.390> just<00:04:25.390> kind<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.140> tickle<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.590> inside

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
off just kind of tickle the inside

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.940 
off just kind of tickle the inside
the<00:04:27.710> line<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:30.080> there's<00:04:30.320> no<00:04:32.380> hard<00:04:33.380> edge<00:04:33.650> there

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
the line so there's no hard edge there

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.320 
the line so there's no hard edge there
I'll<00:04:34.160> scoop<00:04:34.520> up<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.730> little<00:04:34.970> bit<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.180> white

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
I'll scoop up a little bit of white

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.140 
I'll scoop up a little bit of white
right<00:04:35.360> on<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.840> tip<00:04:36.170> of<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.440> brush<00:04:37.250> again<00:04:37.700> put

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
right on the tip of the brush again put

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.300 
right on the tip of the brush again put
a<00:04:38.180> little<00:04:38.390> bit<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.600> bright<00:04:38.810> highlight<00:04:39.310> now

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
a little bit of a bright highlight now

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.710 
a little bit of a bright highlight now
see<00:04:40.640> it<00:04:40.790> looks<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.090> it's<00:04:41.240> kind<00:04:41.390> of<00:04:41.510> touching

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
see it looks like it's kind of touching

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.630 
see it looks like it's kind of touching
the<00:04:41.990> stem<00:04:42.230> underneath<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.100> I<00:04:43.160> come<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.460> with

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
the stem underneath so if I come in with

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.430 
the stem underneath so if I come in with
some<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.350> deep<00:04:45.350> cinnabar<00:04:45.950> green<00:04:46.430> and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
some of this deep cinnabar green and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.810 
some of this deep cinnabar green and
maybe<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.560> touch<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.010> Van<00:04:49.130> Dyck<00:04:49.340> Brown<00:04:49.370> just

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
maybe a touch of the Van Dyck Brown just

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.150 
maybe a touch of the Van Dyck Brown just
to<00:04:49.910> darken<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.330> down<00:04:50.540> I<00:04:50.570> want<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.930> fairly<00:04:51.770> dark

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
to darken that down I want a fairly dark

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.260 
to darken that down I want a fairly dark
green<00:04:54.340> watch<00:04:55.340> how<00:04:55.490> when<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.700> put<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:56.000> shadow

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
green watch how when I put the shadow

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.540 
green watch how when I put the shadow
underneath<00:04:56.810> as<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.110> sets<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.560> drop<00:04:57.860> right<00:04:58.070> up

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
underneath as it sets that drop right up

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.130 
underneath as it sets that drop right up
it<00:04:59.150> makes<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.480> look<00:04:59.660> like<00:04:59.690> it's<00:05:00.020> coming

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
it makes it look like it's coming

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.640 
it makes it look like it's coming
forward<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.010> actually<00:05:01.310> gives<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.700> depth<00:05:02.650> so

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
forward and actually gives it depth so

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.380 
forward and actually gives it depth so
they're<00:05:03.890> just<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.400> simple<00:05:04.700> they<00:05:04.940> really<00:05:05.240> are

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
they're just that simple they really are

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.030 
they're just that simple they really are
the<00:05:05.630> key<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.960> getting<00:05:06.170> the<00:05:06.320> shape<00:05:06.560> right<00:05:06.800> and

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
the key is getting the shape right and

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.460 
the key is getting the shape right and
not<00:05:07.160> putting<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.580> really<00:05:07.850> big<00:05:08.150> thick<00:05:08.540> chalky

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
not putting a really big thick chalky

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.260 
not putting a really big thick chalky
white<00:05:09.680> line<00:05:10.070> I'm<00:05:10.280> gonna<00:05:10.370> do<00:05:10.550> one<00:05:10.820> more<00:05:11.000> here

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
white line I'm gonna do one more here

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.840 
white line I'm gonna do one more here
really<00:05:11.450> quickly<00:05:11.980> glory<00:05:12.980> back<00:05:13.190> into<00:05:13.460> that<00:05:13.550> same

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
really quickly glory back into that same

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.680 
really quickly glory back into that same
white<00:05:14.090> mixture<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.630> had<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.970> right<00:05:17.480> over

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
white mixture that I had and right over

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.390 
white mixture that I had and right over
here<00:05:17.990> I'm<00:05:18.140> gonna<00:05:18.290> say<00:05:18.470> there's<00:05:18.710> one<00:05:18.860> that's<00:05:19.070> a

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
here I'm gonna say there's one that's a

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.060 
here I'm gonna say there's one that's a
drip<00:05:19.760> drop<00:05:20.000> that's<00:05:20.270> coming<00:05:20.570> off<00:05:20.690> this<00:05:24.070> leaf

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
drip drop that's coming off this leaf
