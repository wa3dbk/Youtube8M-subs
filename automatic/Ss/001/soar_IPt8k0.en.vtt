00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
first year if you could see there when I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
first year if you could see there when I

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
about it I'm really kind of still

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
about it I'm really kind of still
irritated<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.040> least<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.369> on

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
irritated about it but at least it's on

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
irritated about it but at least it's on
the<00:01:23.580> back<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> cake<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:25.409> pretty

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the back of the cake and that's pretty

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
the back of the cake and that's pretty
much<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> la<00:01:26.610> too<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
much it it's not a la too much on the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.649 
much it it's not a la too much on the
front<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.070> front<00:01:29.310> there

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
front because there's the front there

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
front because there's the front there
but<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.840> happened<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.590> realized<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
but that happened I realized because I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.480 
but that happened I realized because I
decorated<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> bottom<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.710> took<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.460> time

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
decorated the bottom and I took my time

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.200 
decorated the bottom and I took my time
decorating<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.369> then<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> put<00:01:39.030> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
decorating it and then when I put this

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
decorating it and then when I put this
the<00:01:39.600> second<00:01:40.020> layer<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.070> fondant<00:01:41.310> had

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the second layer on the fondant had

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.120 
the second layer on the fondant had
already<00:01:41.729> said<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> did<00:01:43.950> set

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
already said a little so when I did set

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.830 
already said a little so when I did set
it<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.909> touched<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it on it and it touched some of the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
it on it and it touched some of the
sides<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:47.070> around<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.960> created<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
sides like around here it created a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
sides like around here it created a
suppression<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.450> fondant<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.049> created

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
suppression on that fondant and created

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
suppression on that fondant and created
to<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> next<00:01:53.280> time<00:01:53.460> i'm<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.119> to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
underneath each layer and then one long

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
underneath each layer and then one long
dowel<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.430> through<00:02:32.670> all<00:02:32.960> three<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:33.990> them

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230

that<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.800> sharpened<00:02:35.310> with<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:36.380> pencil

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
sharpener and then I just hammered it

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.080 
sharpener and then I just hammered it
through<00:02:39.240> real<00:02:39.450> quick<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.800> that's<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:44.090> hope

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
through real quick so but that's it hope

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.120

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
you guys enjoy it so not bad I guess for

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.860 
you guys enjoy it so not bad I guess for
a<00:02:50.190> second<00:02:50.580> try<00:02:50.700> hopefully<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.450> next<00:02:51.570> time<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
a second try hopefully the next time I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
a second try hopefully the next time I
do<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.200> I'll<00:02:52.320> get<00:02:52.470> better<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.370> next

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
do it I'll get better and then the next

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.330 
do it I'll get better and then the next
time<00:02:53.670> better<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:55.320> about<00:02:55.350> trial<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
time better so it's all about trial and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.640 
time better so it's all about trial and
error<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.700> practice<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.360> will<00:02:58.260> talk<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
error and practice I will talk to you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.770
