painting it the color of the office and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.320 
painting it the color of the office and
creating<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.910> vignette<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.780> sorts<00:04:49.180> behind<00:04:50.180> it

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
creating a vignette of sorts behind it

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.820 
creating a vignette of sorts behind it
with<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.630> sideboard<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.350> bed<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
with the sideboard in the bed and the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.460 
with the sideboard in the bed and the
chairs<00:04:52.100> in<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.400> lamps<00:04:52.729> so<00:04:53.479> it<00:04:53.750> really<00:04:54.229> came

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
chairs in the lamps so it really came

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.219 
chairs in the lamps so it really came
out<00:04:54.970> incredibly<00:04:55.970> beautifully<00:04:57.700> okay<00:04:59.229> let's

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
out incredibly beautifully okay let's

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.429 
out incredibly beautifully okay let's
see

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
see

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.949 
see
and<00:05:02.429> keep<00:05:02.699> jiggling<00:05:02.969> with<00:05:03.239> it<00:05:03.360> until<00:05:03.659> you<00:05:03.779> get

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:03.959 
and keep jiggling with it until you get

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:15.909 
and keep jiggling with it until you get
it<00:05:04.909> to<00:05:05.909> be<00:05:06.029> balanced

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.770 

but<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.580> Chinese<00:05:16.789> aesthetic<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.479> one<00:05:17.659> of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
but the Chinese aesthetic is one of

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.950 
but the Chinese aesthetic is one of
pairs<00:05:18.139> everything's<00:05:18.949> in<00:05:19.129> pairs<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.669> so<00:05:19.960> I

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
pairs everything's in pairs and so I

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.010 
pairs everything's in pairs and so I
like<00:05:21.409> that<00:05:21.620> but<00:05:22.370> then<00:05:22.669> on<00:05:22.999> the<00:05:23.060> other<00:05:23.389> hand<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
like that but then on the other hand the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.980 
like that but then on the other hand the
Japanese<00:05:24.490> aesthetic<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:25.610> about<00:05:25.849> asymmetry<00:05:26.479> so

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
Japanese aesthetic is about asymmetry so

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.320 
Japanese aesthetic is about asymmetry so
I<00:05:27.289> have<00:05:27.469> both<00:05:27.710> of<00:05:27.770> those<00:05:28.099> input<00:05:28.699> into<00:05:28.999> me<00:05:29.120> and

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
I have both of those input into me and

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.879 
I have both of those input into me and
sometimes<00:05:29.779> a<00:05:30.139> symmetrical<00:05:30.680> arrangement

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
sometimes a symmetrical arrangement

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.159 
sometimes a symmetrical arrangement
works<00:05:31.340> best<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:31.909> sometimes<00:05:32.300> an<00:05:32.479> asymmetrical

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
works best and sometimes an asymmetrical

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.450 
works best and sometimes an asymmetrical
arrangement<00:05:33.770> works<00:05:33.919> best

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
arrangement works best

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.070 
arrangement works best
this<00:05:34.580> is<00:05:34.729> totally<00:05:35.150> symmetrical<00:05:35.719> there's<00:05:35.930> two

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
this is totally symmetrical there's two

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.739 
this is totally symmetrical there's two
chairs<00:05:36.319> two<00:05:36.680> pots<00:05:36.949> to<00:05:37.400> plant<00:05:38.120> stands<00:05:38.569> two

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
chairs two pots to plant stands two

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.769 
chairs two pots to plant stands two
bases<00:05:39.490> put<00:05:40.490> these<00:05:40.699> hot<00:05:41.029> boxes<00:05:41.539> together

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
bases put these hot boxes together

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.260 
bases put these hot boxes together
there's<00:05:42.680> a<00:05:42.770> pair<00:05:43.099> and<00:05:43.249> a<00:05:43.310> pair<00:05:43.550> than<00:05:43.789> a<00:05:43.819> single

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
there's a pair and a pair than a single

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.200 
there's a pair and a pair than a single
so<00:05:44.840> there's<00:05:45.319> a<00:05:45.409> there's<00:05:46.189> a<00:05:46.279> peacefulness<00:05:46.819> and

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
so there's a there's a peacefulness and

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.240 
so there's a there's a peacefulness and
there's<00:05:47.389> a<00:05:47.449> right<00:05:47.810> way<00:05:47.840> to<00:05:48.169> show<00:05:48.949> almost

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
there's a right way to show almost

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.670 
there's a right way to show almost
almost<00:05:49.969> everything<00:05:50.629> but<00:05:51.110> if<00:05:51.199> you<00:05:51.289> come<00:05:51.560> over

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
almost everything but if you come over

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.529 
almost everything but if you come over
here<00:05:51.860> in<00:05:52.099> the<00:05:52.310> Japan<00:05:52.460> section<00:05:53.120> you'll<00:05:53.300> see

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
here in the Japan section you'll see

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.179 
here in the Japan section you'll see
that<00:05:53.719> there's<00:05:53.930> very<00:05:54.020> very<00:05:54.379> little<00:05:54.560> symmetry

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:55.189 
that there's very very little symmetry

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.499 
that there's very very little symmetry
here<00:05:55.310> with<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.580> exception<00:05:56.029> of<00:05:56.090> these<00:05:56.270> two

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
here with the exception of these two

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.529 
here with the exception of these two
chaises<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.830> black<00:05:58.039> runs<00:05:58.310> here<00:05:58.550> because<00:05:59.419> on
