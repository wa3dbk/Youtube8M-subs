00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
batteries with solar also we can charge

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.840 
batteries with solar also we can charge
the<00:00:49.890> batteries<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> third<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.850> if

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the batteries and the third one is if

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
the batteries and the third one is if
there<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.089> no<00:00:54.390> solar<00:00:54.839> no<00:00:55.140> power<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:56.280> can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
there is no solar no power we can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.479 
there is no solar no power we can
generate<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> power<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.489> moving

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
generate the power with this moving

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.240 
generate the power with this moving
panel<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.839> observe<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.440> light<00:01:01.620> whenever

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
panel we can observe the light whenever

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
panel we can observe the light whenever
I<00:01:02.399> move<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.549> charge<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I move it you can also charge so this is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.020 
I move it you can also charge so this is
the<00:01:13.590> best<00:01:13.830> emergency<00:01:15.049> solar<00:01:16.070> power<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.820> also

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the best emergency solar power and also

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.900
