00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
which I haven't seen an answer to will

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.390 
which I haven't seen an answer to will
the<00:03:12.090> horses<00:03:12.540> die<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:13.560> injured<00:03:13.920> or<00:03:14.130> get

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the horses die get injured or get

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.540 
the horses die get injured or get
diseases<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.210> am<00:03:15.930> assuming<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:17.010> will<00:03:17.190> at

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
diseases I am assuming that they will at

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.370 
diseases I am assuming that they will at
least<00:03:17.760> die<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.300> Warriors<00:03:18.630> are<00:03:18.870> sticking<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
least die if Warriors are sticking to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.590 
least die if Warriors are sticking to
being<00:03:19.890> realistic<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.970> think<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.240> disease

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
being realistic and I think the disease

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.480 
being realistic and I think the disease
thing<00:03:21.840> could<00:03:22.080> definitely<00:03:22.320> add<00:03:22.680> something<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
thing could definitely add something to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.720 
thing could definitely add something to
the<00:03:23.580> RPG<00:03:24.000> field<00:03:24.560> having<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:26.010> not<00:03:26.220> only<00:03:26.430> take

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
the RPG field having to not only take

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.030 
the RPG field having to not only take
care<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.090> yourself<00:03:27.540> with<00:03:27.780> food<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.170> water<00:03:28.320> but

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
care of yourself with food and water but

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.590 
care of yourself with food and water but
to<00:03:29.100> make<00:03:29.340> sure<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.640> your<00:03:29.790> horse<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.090> healthy

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
to make sure that your horse is healthy

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.780 
to make sure that your horse is healthy
in<00:03:30.800> addition<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.640> would<00:03:32.730> be

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
in addition to that I think it would be

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.000 
in addition to that I think it would be
pretty<00:03:32.940> cool<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.240> further<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.900> RPG<00:03:34.560> feel<00:03:34.800> if

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
pretty cool to further the RPG feel if

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.670 
pretty cool to further the RPG feel if
you<00:03:35.520> had<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.850> feet<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.480> water<00:03:36.990> your<00:03:37.290> horse<00:03:37.530> as

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
you had the feet and water your horse as

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.950 
you had the feet and water your horse as
well<00:03:37.760> like<00:03:38.760> when<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.300> arrive<00:03:39.510> into<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.810> new

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
well like when you arrive into a new

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.180 
well like when you arrive into a new
town<00:03:40.140> you'll<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.590> find<00:03:40.740> a<00:03:40.860> water<00:03:41.040> source

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
town you'll have to find a water source

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.840 
town you'll have to find a water source
for<00:03:41.550> you<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.000> your<00:03:42.660> horse<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:44.250> could<00:03:44.490> be<00:03:44.670> made

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
for you and your horse it could be made

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.430 
for you and your horse it could be made
into<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.240> different<00:03:45.540> mode<00:03:45.780> where<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.260> could

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
into a different mode where you could

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.590 
into a different mode where you could
you<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.950> have<00:03:47.400> multiple<00:03:48.000> difficulties

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
you know have multiple difficulties

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
where you've got to feed and water and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.800 
where you've got to feed and water and
all<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.530> jazz<00:03:52.830> for<00:03:53.220> yourself<00:03:53.610> but<00:03:54.209> maybe<00:03:54.690> a

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
all that jazz for yourself but maybe a

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.080 
all that jazz for yourself but maybe a
harder<00:03:55.140> difficulty<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:56.250> has<00:03:56.400> your<00:03:56.730> horse

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090

of the horse mechanic that we have been

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.840 
of the horse mechanic that we have been

placeholder<00:04:12.180> just<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:13.440> case<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.770> were

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
placeholder just in case you were

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.920

wondering if it didn't live up to what

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.500 
wondering if it didn't live up to what
you<00:04:16.020> expected<00:04:16.500> from<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> realistic<00:04:17.280> graphics

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
you expected from the realistic graphics

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.940 
you expected from the realistic graphics
it's<00:04:18.510> just<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.810> show<00:04:19.020> off<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.320> mechanic<00:04:19.799> and

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
it's just the show off the mechanic and

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.099 
it's just the show off the mechanic and
show<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.910> they're<00:04:21.060> really<00:04:21.450> working<00:04:21.750> very

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
show that they're really working very

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:22.719 
show that they're really working very
hard<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.470> it

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
hard on it

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.070 
hard on it
warhorse<00:04:23.729> planned<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.120> make<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.510> believable

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
warhorse planned to make it a believable

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.270 
warhorse planned to make it a believable
realistic<00:04:25.710> mechanic

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
realistic mechanic

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.220 
realistic mechanic
through<00:04:26.460> further<00:04:27.000> animations<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.870> visuals

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
through further animations and visuals

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.500 
through further animations and visuals
so<00:04:28.590> look<00:04:28.800> forward<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.220> so<00:04:30.000> far<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.389> are

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
so look forward to that so far there are

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.150 
so look forward to that so far there are
three<00:04:30.900> animations<00:04:31.470> for<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> different

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
three animations for the different

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.710 
three animations for the different
speeds<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.850> horse<00:04:33.060> can<00:04:33.270> travel<00:04:33.570> app

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
speeds that the horse can travel app

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.220 
speeds that the horse can travel app
walking<00:04:34.650> trotting<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.400> galloping<00:04:36.050> there<00:04:37.050> are

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
walking trotting and galloping there are

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.409 
walking trotting and galloping there are
ideal<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:38.040> move<00:04:38.220> animations<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:39.060> which

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
ideal to move animations to which

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.360 
ideal to move animations to which
they're<00:04:40.169> just<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.500> work<00:04:40.650> in<00:04:40.800> progress<00:04:40.980> at<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
they're just a work in progress at the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.909 
they're just a work in progress at the
moment<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.940> they<00:04:42.120> look<00:04:42.240> pretty<00:04:42.270> good<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:42.660> far

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
moment but they look pretty good so far

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.710 
moment but they look pretty good so far
it's<00:04:43.919> just<00:04:44.130> like<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.639> animation<00:04:44.970> going<00:04:45.180> from

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
it's just like the animation going from

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.960 
it's just like the animation going from
staying<00:04:46.110> still<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.530> your<00:04:46.650> horse<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:47.370> one<00:04:47.850> of

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
staying still on your horse to one of

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.290 
staying still on your horse to one of
the<00:04:48.120> three<00:04:48.330> speeds<00:04:48.630> animation<00:04:49.880> later<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.150> you

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
the three speeds animation later on you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.850 
the three speeds animation later on you
will<00:04:51.450> be<00:04:51.630> able<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.930> equip<00:04:52.169> your<00:04:52.380> horse<00:04:52.620> with

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
will be able to equip your horse with

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.890 
will be able to equip your horse with
different<00:04:53.310> gear<00:04:53.669> like<00:04:54.030> changing<00:04:54.419> as<00:04:54.540> brittle

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
different gear like changing as brittle
