00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.730
 It would be good to ask if it is 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.040
 really now would be the time 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.590
 replacement or in any case would rather 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.170
 moment to start debugging a little bit 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.170
 the teams and raise a sentence 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.529
 besides only one deletion my 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.720
 Dear Diana, I would like to talk with you 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.269
 because I think that after so much 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.510
 time and you a week already like 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.000
 captains I think we would already be in 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.199
 conditions of being able to evaluate a week 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.059
 of sentence with a possible elimination 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.079
 now it would be in your hands obviously 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.739
 of the red team eliminate someone to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.739
 who would eliminate 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.630
 by capacity obviously by the only 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.630
 reason I'm asking about capacity 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.210
 well mena 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.400
 for an issue that still 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.270
 has little time and does not arrive 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.970
 comes to welcome strength due to the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.010
 competitor perhaps in the best option I 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 I could be a captain a little more 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.420
 impossible if I do not want him to leave 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 dove or mario of neighborhood would suit 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.110
 as a strategy but I think things 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.580
 better you have to play them clean and the one 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.200
 against one a good competitor with good 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.480
 competitor today this other as if merit 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.300
 of the army would be to ask him if 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.770
 meditate what do you think 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.240
 obviously when there may be 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.250
 listened to what the chata diana says 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.790
 jose bueno I think I'm competing 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 all right 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.650
 I am already proving that I have improved 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.980
 since I arrived 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.110
 I'm winning and unfortunately not 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.820
 alexandra the better he has won me 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.620
 but good, the majority believe that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.570
 scenario you think there is someone else 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.970
 fighter with this type or the other 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.640
 team that is your case weaker than you 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 in the competitions 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.030
 well I think it looked 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.090
 or considered if I asked you 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 who you would eliminate would eliminate that 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.880
 it looked like the team really obviously 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:17.050
 but it's been improved, I think the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.440
 alessandro alexandra's book is going to be worth 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.300
 that condition to see if any of us are going to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.070
 defend your coming when we have done 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.780
 two against you I've won it all like this 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.740
 that just saying that I do not think it's 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.239
 I the weakest 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.739
 we will fight we have played one of the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.470
 next games can not put together 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.390
 just say that was really my friend you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.920
 I want very much I miss you dear what 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.920
 what are you saying because it 's yellow 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.450
 of you are only asking me 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 who would eliminate because one thing that 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.300
 we are friends and other things like 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.590
 complete that has nothing to do with 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.150
 that but so much husband made me that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.150
 alexandra is worse than me then 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.849
 john has said that to me I was wondering 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.110
 who would choose the red team but who 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.060
 you are asking me to whom 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.870
 would choose from I do not think that well in the team 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.900
 red I think it would be the best option 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.859
 and you decide for lucia good in the case 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.859
 of team questions 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.590
 the team something more not only say 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.900
 I do not like that always the whole weight 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.329
 everything falls on me there is a fault and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.099
 it falls on me there is a problem and they relapse and 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.049
 I think the the easiest option that 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.450
 they have all the fighters always of 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.980
 everything that happens is to put it to me and I 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.139
 I think they dedicate to know better the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.400
 Effort Yemeni progress really 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.750
 I feel that she is wrong and I 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.790
 It's very surprising because I have a lot 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.319
 honey and back way back from 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.609
 screen they do not say the same then I 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.109
 surprise a little bit now my 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.970
 buddy I need a consultation and the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.379
 same question has been seen to target not 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.810
 who would consider that it should be 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.450
 eliminated and said ximena because the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.370
 reaction reaction looked different 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.989
 Ximena's because it bothers you so much that 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.989
 keep that opinion simply 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.910
 green team removes your name 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.989
 So starting this that promote and 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.510
 because it has nothing to do with the 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.700
 Honey, you do not have friendship, much less 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.010
 because I think that unfortunately one 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.470
 makes a fame and when I arrived it was almost 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.180
 very bad and if I cried a lot and now I have 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.130
 to get me that fame and that's what 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.230
 I'm doing they still think I'm 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.240
 the worst depression so I think that 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.010
 better better obviously we have all 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.780
 improved that has also improved and 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.340
 I also lost everyone we all have 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.350
 achieved only that they are asking me 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.060
 I know you answered not just listen to me 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.910
 I feel bad that was nobody's 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.260
 Red team would eliminate me no longer do I have 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.320
 nothing against it I really like the 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.500
 investment question complaint here 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.150
 would eliminate was the red team 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.560
 to dÃ©bora because I feel it is the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.620
 mother watching the team I feel it is more 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.120
 weak that his little hand and nothing for that just 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.700
 I did not like the other day that he scolded 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.380
 lark told him he questioned his injury 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.750
 in the rib I had that injury and 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.540
 it hurts a lot so for that reason I 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.130
 I would also eliminate it with beasts and 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.720
 we make a comparison regarding the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.400
 competition is concerned considers that 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.350
 deborah is weaker than tutors better 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.240
 competitor that caused that if 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.370
 at the moment she can be better than 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.710
 me and everything but at this moment I feel 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.480
 that what little you 're talking about today if 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.980
 the little that advanced makes me better 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.200
 fact is in the duels that I have had 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.900
 against barack I could be 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.060
 give away misfortunes of fear that 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.640
 first you think from your own 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.600
 dissolution obviously I like it 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.580
 compete with someone who has had 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.320
 Weather here is as skylark and not 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.480
 she's a bad competitor and I've 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.830
 won in several games 2 I do not know what 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.930
 your comment comes because I did not have 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.789
 no candle in what I said yesterday 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.789
 we had grown up in the group 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:03.449
 well obviously it seems that he barely speaks 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.690
 of high berries immediately and why 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.430
 and what happens that reacts to the sound of his 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.229
 humor as it is good I do not swear you 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.550
 he just wants to add that there are many 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.740
 people who think that I was in 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.509
 combat here a lot of time and in 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.819
 reality the whole considered that only here 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.800
 I was yellowish so I never had 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.630
 the opportunity or mud nothing more bold 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.039
 the buttons and everything then I want 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.139
 clarify that indeed for me too 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.060
 enter this new season all the 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.009
 games are operated is for the 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.050
 competition are just as new as the 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.610
 guys that have entered this summer and 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.599
 I ask you and quick 20 is that 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.639
 would have to eliminate someone from 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.639
 red team here would you eliminate 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.200
 from now 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.200
 why 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.090
 I always put 11 and I think that 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.850
 I 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.560
 the percentage of cattle in asking little 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.000
 more opportunities I never had a 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.370
 opportunity to compete with Jimenita for 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.990
 that could not know exactly what is 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.970
 the level of the statesmen being in my 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.320
 case with hours would count because in 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.320
 reality with the union with which I compete 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.300
 as I did the first week 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.460
 a few years if you want that pau has 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.930
 won because I leave you behind but I do not 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:24.260
 win more times we won you're the same 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.260
 because team that is 6 in the bad 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:34.290
 obviously the captain of the green team 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.480
 all this here would eliminate this 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.800
 preliminary I tell you I do not think I have 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.290
 the right to eliminate anyone here every 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.110
 you know who the paper is for 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.030
 Here I am surprised if the attitude of 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.560
 at the moment he talks about yemenitas 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.320
 because Jimenita is a very important person 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.550
 but what happens is that the question is very 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.130
 concrete 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.330
 namely your capital rather than anyone what 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.100
 of the green team would have to eliminate 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.680
 because it is a week of sentence and here 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.240
 is done so you have to decide which of 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.760
 the boys see down green good not 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.560
 nothing personal but at the level of what you 

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.420
 I say if we save tastes at a 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.370
 competitive if the days has always 

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.560
 had a lot of trouble has advanced a lot 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.240
 unfortunately if I had to take a 

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.220
 Today's action would be lucid because 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.990
 and tomorrow I'll be injured right now 

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.490
 now 

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.490
 let's ask a question
