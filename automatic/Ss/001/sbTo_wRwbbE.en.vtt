 I will tell about those results which 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.430
 I have now a few 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.280
 months after starting use 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.049
 course materials 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.560
 as a coach, it is always interesting for me 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.310
 and it’s very nice to see how 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.329
 my students are developing a project 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.140

 kabule even a small strip finance so 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.060
 that they switch five contexts 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.870
 the first in the first exhibition to say 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.970
 it was very difficult not to make a decision to go 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.110
 for this course 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.180
 just because you were here already 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.580
 bought tickets for the whole family in thailand 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.980
 were going to ride sat on their suitcases 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.680
 and then came the invitation 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 I must say that by that time 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.220
 the source is again quite active 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.860
 recruited subscribers and social networks 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.230
 but how is it transformed by subscribers and fund 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.230
 customer social networks 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.580
 percentage how to do it correctly 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.120
 I definitely did not know anyone what might be needed 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.290
 make them an offer not twice again 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.100
 intrusive 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.260
 customers for sure had questions on those on 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.460
 which i think i will get on gold 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.770
 active but let see what 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.340
 happened 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 Look here until January of this year 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.970

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.430
 I have already saved about 1700 people here 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.220
 not bad I was very pleased with the dynamics 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.350
 what happened after that he after 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.680
 how i got 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.010
 technicians who gave azamat 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.190
 there st 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.540
 how to make subscription pages because 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.180
 grew to its subscribers like 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 build relationships how to do so 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.220
 the subscribers of your letters opened 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.540
 you will see growth just attributed to her 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.880
 just explosive growth and here but thanks 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.740
 big for date technique which 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.900
 shook 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.480
 but you know that, but probably the most 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 main dortmund valentine odds not 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.670
 so that people 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 growth increased yes we do in order 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.610
 to people 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.080
 opened up 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.270
 and our letters for them to come 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.159
 our website 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.559
 and now let's look at 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.949
 statistics as generally average in the world people 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.309
 open as march writes and how often not 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.539
 come to the site 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:17.839
 information is provided 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.489
 smartphones are equal 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.169
 and you see that there is such a parameter 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.599
 follow links 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.389
 This transition is rumored as a rule 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.439
 keeps but here is an area of ​​four three 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.730
 percent of cases when 8 for mezim 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.930
 as a rule you see a single result 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.049
 that's the use 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.319
 about three n four percent 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.599
 about something it says it says that 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.349
 only three people from 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.079
 and follows the link in the letter and meets 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.760
 with the sentences that you do not do 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.980
 on the site or often discussions that you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.369
 offer young 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.209
 give let's see what I have 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.069
 I am not looking for a percentage of delivering a day 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.299
 counters but here at that moment when got up and 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.299
 found that 34 percent of people 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.339
 there is a big enough mailing they 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.689
 crossed on my links 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.959
 and looked at the sentence that I 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.299
 did not 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.199
 but he 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.609
 beautiful percent almost 10 times 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.009
 more than a year on average in statistics 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.169
 he showed 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.149
 how many percent of people open food 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.289
 but let's stimulate 30 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.449
 percent i have a good result i 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.569
 I really thought that in it to read all 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.829
 Mike Fisher news is true 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.579
 less than 30 percent is very good 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.559
 result 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.699
 but in fact not even that is important to us 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.479
 it is important that people do not just get acquainted with 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.929
 our offer 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.439
 it is important to us that people yuan shopping 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.669
 us commercial projects 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.819
 and since I am engaged in particular 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.439
 samara projects undervalued 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.519
 you know ap in December used 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.829
 this season yes because in december people 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.339
 are concerned 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.289
 just two nominees so that 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:55.349
 they did 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.809
 and in December, launched a sales training 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.299
 stadium 30 days but let's see 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.290
 here is December I choose paid order iii 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.370
 that in the end I see what I was 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.069
 Deal datse orders for raw materials 2000 rubles 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.879
 but the result is the media so I waited I read 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.259
 certainly a much better result 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.539
 what happened after i already knew 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.879
 like Halay and recruit as a subscriber 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.360
 work them how are you doing blues 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.180
 sell see constantly 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.060
 but he failed to release a cent higher 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.919
 training itself 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.939
 to the stadium in 30 minutes 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.099
 if you see that we are capturing 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.179
 May holidays generally more part 

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:38.259
 that time two weeks i'm 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.259
 Turkey 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.389
 percentage of study on holiday 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.029
 nevertheless what is happening 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.309
 petri pack this training and you see 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.309
 that 114 sales totaling 90 thousand rubles 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.669
 And I boldly increase sales 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.540
 managed afp 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.050
 more than four times increase 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.939
 number of sales 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.669
 percentage and this is not the limit 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.740
 I know how I will work from this base 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.339
 because new dictionaries have seen 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.389
 did you see on the chart what actually 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.399
 most people working a month 2 fl 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.619
 not very long time 

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:13.509
 to restore hundreds of durable 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:14.509
 relationship 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.620
 and this is the creation of this serious trust 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.840
 percent i know how i will work this 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.650
 bases further I know how I go again 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.729
 double arrange to lose one's 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:24.930
 results 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.600
 and the play itself know and technology that gave 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.389
 azamat 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.840

 buy material that is 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.789
