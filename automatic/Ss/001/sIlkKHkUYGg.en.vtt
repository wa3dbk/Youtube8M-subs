customer<00:00:00.690> called<00:00:00.930> was<00:00:01.290> was<00:00:01.860> having<00:00:02.129> problems

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
customer called was was having problems

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.220 
customer called was was having problems
with<00:00:02.550> not<00:00:02.879> enough<00:00:02.909> water<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.959> what<00:00:04.140> we

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
with not enough water and what we

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.230 
with not enough water and what we
determined<00:00:04.380> was<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.250> well<00:00:05.490> pump<00:00:05.670> was<00:00:05.879> running

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
determined was the well pump was running

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.059 
determined was the well pump was running
but<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.509> just<00:00:06.629> wasn't<00:00:06.870> pumping<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> GPM<00:00:07.859> that

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
but it just wasn't pumping the GPM that

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.980 
but it just wasn't pumping the GPM that
it<00:00:08.189> should<00:00:08.340> have<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.389> it's<00:00:09.570> getting<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> little

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it should have and it's getting a little

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.990 
it should have and it's getting a little
older<00:00:10.349> typically<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.730> we'd<00:00:11.849> have<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
older typically what we'd have a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.060 
older typically what we'd have a
homeowner<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.809> come<00:00:13.380> downstairs<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.950> take

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
homeowner do is come downstairs and take

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.620 
homeowner do is come downstairs and take
a<00:00:14.099> look<00:00:14.370> at<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> pressure<00:00:14.730> gauge<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.030> see<00:00:15.360> if

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
a look at the pressure gauge and see if

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.140 
a look at the pressure gauge and see if
we're<00:00:15.839> void<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.350> any<00:00:16.470> pressure<00:00:16.770> if<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
we're void of any pressure if there is

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.359 
we're void of any pressure if there is
pressure<00:00:18.480> then<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.380> know<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.039> problem

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
pressure then we know that the problem

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.859 
pressure then we know that the problem
they're<00:00:20.460> having<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.880> most<00:00:21.090> likely<00:00:21.300> inside<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
they're having is most likely inside the

they're having is most likely inside the
home<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:22.769> no<00:00:22.890> pressure<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
home if there's no pressure at all and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460 
home if there's no pressure at all and
we<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.269> power<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.230> usually

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
we know that we have power it's usually

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.710 
we know that we have power it's usually
a<00:00:25.680> problem<00:00:25.920> inside<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.880> well<00:00:27.060> usually

customer has a three wire pump the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
customer has a three wire pump the
control<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.750> actually<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.530> the

control is actually right here on the
wall<00:00:34.829> we're<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.610> putting<00:00:35.820> new

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
wall we're going to be putting new

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
wall we're going to be putting new
control<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.450> along<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> new<00:00:37.020> pump<00:00:37.340> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
control in along with the new pump and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.150 
control in along with the new pump and
from<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.559> either

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
from there either

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.299 
from there either
intermittent<00:00:41.969> water<00:00:42.210> low<00:00:42.989> pressure<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:44.100> just

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
intermittent water low pressure or just

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
intermittent water low pressure or just
no<00:00:44.460> water<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> typical<00:00:45.780> signs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
no water at all are the typical signs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.040 
no water at all are the typical signs
you'd<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> issue<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> pump<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you'd have of a issue with the pump so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
you'd have of a issue with the pump so
we<00:00:49.079> decided<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> change<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.219> pump<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.850> would

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
we decided to change a pump it would

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
we decided to change a pump it would
pump<00:00:51.449> water<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> would<00:00:52.230> take<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.620> six

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pump water but it would take like six

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.290 
pump water but it would take like six
seven<00:00:53.129> hours<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.699> recover<00:00:53.820> completely

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
seven hours for it to recover completely

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.889 
seven hours for it to recover completely
so<00:00:54.989> they'd<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.230> intermittent<00:00:55.739> water<00:00:55.949> use<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
so they'd have intermittent water use so

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.970 
so they'd have intermittent water use so
by<00:00:57.899> changing<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> pump<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> be

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
by changing the pump we're going to be

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
by changing the pump we're going to be
able<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> correct<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.489> problem<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.940> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
able to correct that problem for the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200 
able to correct that problem for the
customer<00:01:01.309> all<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.789> clamping

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
customer all right now we're clamping

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
customer all right now we're clamping
our<00:01:03.329> well<00:01:03.510> puller<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:04.320> casing<00:01:04.559> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
our well puller to the well casing this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.070 
our well puller to the well casing this
is<00:01:05.640> what's<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.030> allow<00:01:06.150> us<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.540> pull<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
is what's going to allow us to pull the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.740 
is what's going to allow us to pull the
pump<00:01:07.290> pipe<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.740> wiring<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> well

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.399 

normal<00:01:20.060> these<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.240> bleeders<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> what

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
normal these are bleeders and what

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
normal these are bleeders and what
they're<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> air<00:01:23.130> volume<00:01:23.460> control

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
they're for is the air volume control

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.090 
they're for is the air volume control
system<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.689> every<00:01:24.869> time<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> pump<00:01:25.409> kick<00:01:25.590> kicks

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
system so every time the pump kick kicks

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
system so every time the pump kick kicks
on<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.549> slug<00:01:27.090> air<00:01:27.360> goes<00:01:27.600> into<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> pressure

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
on a slug air goes into the pressure

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.690 
on a slug air goes into the pressure
tank<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.890> maintains<00:01:29.100> our<00:01:29.490> air

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
tank and that's what maintains our air

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.420 
tank and that's what maintains our air
level<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> tank<00:01:30.890> what<00:01:31.890> happens<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
level in the tank what happens is the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
level in the tank what happens is the
bleeders<00:01:32.850> release<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> pressure<00:01:33.869> after<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
bleeders release the pressure after the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.490 
bleeders release the pressure after the
pump<00:01:34.829> shuts<00:01:35.070> off<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:36.509> short<00:01:37.049> section<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
pump shuts off and this short section of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 
pump shuts off and this short section of
pipe<00:01:37.650> drains<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.390> atmosphere

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
pipe drains out and it's at atmosphere

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.810 
pipe drains out and it's at atmosphere
and<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.860> happens<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> pump<00:01:41.610> kicks

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and what happens is when the pump kicks

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
and what happens is when the pump kicks
on<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.540> bleeder<00:01:42.840> closes<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> bleeder

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
on this bleeder closes that bleeder

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
on this bleeder closes that bleeder
closes<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> air<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.090> pipe

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
closes and the air that's in this pipe

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
closes and the air that's in this pipe
gets<00:01:45.930> compressed<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.500> shot<00:01:46.710> into<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
gets compressed and shot into the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.980 
gets compressed and shot into the
pressure<00:01:47.280> tank<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.360> air<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.840> comes

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
pressure tank and that air that comes

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
pressure tank and that air that comes
into<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> tank<00:01:49.590> every<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> pump<00:01:50.490> runs

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
into the tank every time the pump runs

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.060 
into the tank every time the pump runs
is<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.630> maintains<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.350> air<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> water

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
is what maintains the air and water

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.789 
is what maintains the air and water
ratio<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> pressure<00:01:54.390> tank<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:55.590> one

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
ratio in the pressure tank so that's one

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.310 
ratio in the pressure tank so that's one
form<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.630> pressure<00:01:57.630> tank<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.140> can

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
the orange mud you see that's iron oxide

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.190 
the orange mud you see that's iron oxide
it's<00:02:10.429> naturally<00:02:11.120> occurring<00:02:11.450> iron<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.930> well

this<00:02:23.090> level<00:02:23.330> we<00:02:23.840> really<00:02:24.049> should<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.290> an<00:02:24.379> iron

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
this level we really should have an iron

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.470 
this level we really should have an iron
filter<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.640> we'll<00:02:25.790> talk<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.180> homeowner

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.610 
filter and we'll talk to the homeowner
about<00:02:26.510> adding<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:29.260> set<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.379> right<00:02:30.500> on

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
about adding that then set it right on

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.869 
about adding that then set it right on
the<00:02:30.709> case<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.129> so<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.370> take<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.549> picture

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879

calculated<00:03:33.380> how<00:03:33.680> many<00:03:33.739> pellets<00:03:34.190> we<00:03:34.310> need<00:03:34.459> to

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
calculated how many pellets we need to

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.699 
calculated how many pellets we need to
sanitize<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.209> well<00:03:35.419> we'll<00:03:35.959> then<00:03:36.079> pour<00:03:36.319> them<00:03:36.500> in

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
sanitize as well we'll then pour them in

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.830 
sanitize as well we'll then pour them in
first<00:03:37.250> then<00:03:38.090> we're<00:03:38.209> going<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.359> set<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.660> pump

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
first then we're going to set the pump

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.629 
first then we're going to set the pump
in<00:03:39.019> place<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.799> we're<00:03:39.889> going<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.069> circulate<00:03:40.250> it

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
in place and we're going to circulate it

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.690 
in place and we're going to circulate it
and<00:03:41.030> let<00:03:41.870> let<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> well<00:03:42.799> be<00:03:43.220> disinfected

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
and let let the well be disinfected

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.479 
and let let the well be disinfected
overnight<00:03:44.650> yep<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:45.829> is<00:03:45.889> our<00:03:46.099> new<00:03:46.220> bleeder

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
overnight yep this is our new bleeder

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.970 
overnight yep this is our new bleeder
and<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.079> all<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.349> is<00:03:48.410> it's<00:03:48.680> just<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.950> little

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
and this is all it is it's just a little

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.819 
and this is all it is it's just a little
flap<00:03:49.400> when<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.450> water<00:03:50.690> depressurizes<00:03:51.650> it

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
flap when the water depressurizes it

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.920 
flap when the water depressurizes it
opens<00:03:52.160> up<00:03:52.280> laws<00:03:52.579> air<00:03:52.849> in<00:03:53.060> when<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.480> pump<00:03:53.690> kicks

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
opens up laws air in when the pump kicks

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.229 
opens up laws air in when the pump kicks
on<00:03:54.109> it<00:03:54.290> closes<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.919> prevents<00:03:55.910> water<00:03:56.120> from

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
on it closes and prevents water from

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.170 
on it closes and prevents water from
leaking<00:03:56.480> out<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.900> bleeder<00:03:57.760> very<00:03:58.760> simple

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
leaking out of the bleeder very simple

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.460 
leaking out of the bleeder very simple
but<00:03:59.299> effective<00:03:59.540> device<00:04:02.680> 1/2<00:04:03.680> horsepower

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
feet of pipe in the well and we're going

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.230 
feet of pipe in the well and we're going
to<00:04:35.980> do<00:04:36.040> now<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.370> we're<00:04:36.490> going<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.670> put<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.820> 90<00:04:37.210> on

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
to do now is we're going to put a 90 on

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.180 
to do now is we're going to put a 90 on
here<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.660> piece<00:04:37.840> of<00:04:37.870> pipe<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:38.440> we're<00:04:38.980> going

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
here and a piece of pipe and we're going

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.190 
here and a piece of pipe and we're going
to<00:04:39.370> run<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.180> well<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.390> little<00:04:40.720> bit<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:40.990> flush

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
to run the well a little bit and flush

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.860 
to run the well a little bit and flush
any<00:04:41.410> debris<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:42.730> get<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.030> flowing<00:04:43.240> see<00:04:43.720> what

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
any debris just get it flowing see what

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.660 
any debris just get it flowing see what
kind<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.080> volume<00:04:44.260> we're<00:04:44.530> dealing<00:04:44.830> with<00:04:47.670> when

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
kind of volume we're dealing with when

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.280 
kind of volume we're dealing with when
we're<00:04:48.790> inside<00:04:49.150> now<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.660> we're<00:04:49.990> going<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.140> put

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
we're inside now and we're going to put

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.010 
we're inside now and we're going to put
the<00:04:50.380> new<00:04:50.500> control<00:04:50.830> box<00:04:51.070> on<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.810> goes<00:04:52.810> with

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
the new control box on that goes with

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.350 
the new control box on that goes with
this<00:04:53.170> pump<00:04:53.440> this<00:04:54.310> one<00:04:54.580> would<00:04:54.760> run<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.150> but

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
this pump this one would run it but

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.150 
this pump this one would run it but
since<00:04:56.080> we're<00:04:56.200> updating<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.650> pump<00:04:56.830> we<00:04:56.950> want<00:04:57.100> to

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
since we're updating the pump we want to

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.290 
since we're updating the pump we want to
update<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.520> control<00:04:57.850> unit<00:04:58.150> as<00:04:58.270> well<00:05:00.300> the

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
update the control unit as well the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.690 
update the control unit as well the
other<00:05:01.420> pump<00:05:01.690> was<00:05:01.870> taking<00:05:02.320> about<00:05:02.590> six<00:05:03.010> hours<00:05:03.400> to

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
other pump was taking about six hours to

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.760 
other pump was taking about six hours to
finally<00:05:04.060> reach<00:05:04.210> about<00:05:04.450> 60<00:05:04.840> psi<00:05:05.290> which<00:05:05.620> it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
finally reach about 60 psi which it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.580 
finally reach about 60 psi which it
would<00:05:05.920> eventually<00:05:06.160> do<00:05:06.570> but<00:05:07.570> internally<00:05:08.320> what

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
would eventually do but internally what

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.770 
would eventually do but internally what
had<00:05:08.680> happened<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.190> several<00:05:09.550> stages<00:05:10.000> probably

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
had happened is several stages probably

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.750 
had happened is several stages probably
one<00:05:10.990> stage<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.650> pump<00:05:11.890> had<00:05:12.160> separated<00:05:12.670> from

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
one stage of the pump had separated from

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.550 
one stage of the pump had separated from
the<00:05:12.880> shaft<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:13.780> as<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.050> motor<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.440> spinning

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
the shaft so as the motor is spinning

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.680 
the shaft so as the motor is spinning
its<00:05:15.010> lifting<00:05:15.430> water<00:05:15.640> but<00:05:16.240> not<00:05:16.390> lifting

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
its lifting water but not lifting

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.850 
its lifting water but not lifting
anywhere<00:05:16.960> near<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.170> volume<00:05:17.500> that<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.740> was

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
anywhere near the volume that it was

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.890 
anywhere near the volume that it was
designed<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:19.210> that's<00:05:19.330> why<00:05:19.450> we<00:05:19.600> ended<00:05:19.810> up

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
designed to so that's why we ended up

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.090 
designed to so that's why we ended up
pulling<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.260> pump<00:05:20.500> out<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:20.770> putting<00:05:20.920> a<00:05:20.980> new

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
pulling that pump out and putting a new

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.280 
pulling that pump out and putting a new
one<00:05:21.130> in<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:24.490> got<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.760> bleeders<00:05:25.120> back<00:05:25.780> on<00:05:26.020> here

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
one in you got the bleeders back on here

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.950 
one in you got the bleeders back on here
so<00:05:26.620> up<00:05:27.070> so<00:05:27.340> we're<00:05:27.970> all<00:05:28.060> set<00:05:28.330> basically<00:05:28.750> what's

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
so up so we're all set basically what's

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.630 
so up so we're all set basically what's
going<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.110> happen<00:05:29.410> now<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.830> we<00:05:30.370> get<00:05:30.460> this

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
going to happen now is we get this

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.370 
going to happen now is we get this
screwed<00:05:30.940> in<00:05:31.150> we're<00:05:31.870> going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.050> lower<00:05:32.200> it<00:05:32.290> down

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
screwed in we're going to lower it down

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.760 
screwed in we're going to lower it down
attach<00:05:32.980> it<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.340> pitless<00:05:33.640> adapter<00:05:34.650> hook<00:05:35.650> it

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
attach it to the pitless adapter hook it

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.260 
attach it to the pitless adapter hook it
all<00:05:35.860> up<00:05:35.920> test<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.550> we'll<00:05:36.640> be<00:05:36.730> all<00:05:36.790> set<00:05:36.850> to<00:05:37.060> go

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
all up test it we'll be all set to go

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.510 
all up test it we'll be all set to go
alright<00:05:38.230> so<00:05:38.440> we've<00:05:38.590> got<00:05:38.740> our<00:05:38.860> new<00:05:38.890> control<00:05:39.340> in

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
alright so we've got our new control in

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.270 
alright so we've got our new control in
place<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.900> pump<00:05:41.170> is<00:05:41.350> in<00:05:41.530> everything's<00:05:42.100> hooked

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
place the pump is in everything's hooked

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.310 
place the pump is in everything's hooked
up<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:43.240> power<00:05:43.420> is<00:05:43.660> about<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:44.050> be<00:05:44.170> turned

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
up and the power is about to be turned

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.910 
up and the power is about to be turned
on<00:05:44.760> we<00:05:45.760> hear<00:05:46.000> it<00:05:46.090> running<00:05:46.270> now<00:05:46.420> and<00:05:46.810> we<00:05:47.740> have

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
on we hear it running now and we have

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.470 
on we hear it running now and we have
water<00:05:48.160> coming<00:05:48.550> in<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.790> pressure<00:05:49.000> tank<00:05:49.330> we

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
water coming in to the pressure tank we

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.540 
water coming in to the pressure tank we
can<00:05:49.630> hear<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.930> now<00:05:50.340> everybody

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
can hear it now everybody

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.170 
can hear it now everybody
control<00:05:51.880> is<00:05:52.060> working<00:05:52.180> correctly<00:05:52.600> and<00:05:54.180> the

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
control is working correctly and the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.520 
control is working correctly and the
second<00:05:55.540> we'll<00:05:55.690> see<00:05:55.840> pressure<00:05:56.050> starting<00:05:56.470> to

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
second we'll see pressure starting to

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.010 
second we'll see pressure starting to
build<00:05:56.650> on<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:56.920> gauge<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.720> we're<00:05:58.900> building

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
build on the gauge so we're building

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.000 
build on the gauge so we're building
pressure<00:06:01.110> as<00:06:02.110> soon<00:06:02.290> as<00:06:02.350> it<00:06:02.440> shuts<00:06:02.650> off<00:06:02.800> we'll

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
pressure as soon as it shuts off we'll

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.200 
pressure as soon as it shuts off we'll
start<00:06:03.250> running<00:06:03.370> water<00:06:03.670> at<00:06:03.910> one<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.150> the

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
start running water at one of the

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.550 
start running water at one of the
faucets<00:06:04.660> and<00:06:04.810> make<00:06:04.930> sure<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.230> everything

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
faucets and make sure that everything

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:17.530 
faucets and make sure that everything
gets<00:06:05.680> flushed<00:06:05.950> out<00:06:06.130> properly

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.210 

outside<00:06:18.540> we<00:06:18.990> have<00:06:19.170> to<00:06:19.380> install<00:06:19.740> our<00:06:19.770> vermin

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
outside we have to install our vermin

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.760 
outside we have to install our vermin
proof<00:06:20.370> cap<00:06:20.580> will<00:06:21.210> be<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.390> last<00:06:21.600> thing<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.650> the

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
proof cap will be the last thing and the

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.060 
proof cap will be the last thing and the
vermin<00:06:22.950> proof<00:06:23.190> cap<00:06:23.370> helps<00:06:23.580> keep<00:06:24.210> that<00:06:24.390> well

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
vermin proof cap helps keep that well

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.830 
vermin proof cap helps keep that well
from<00:06:26.070> getting<00:06:26.730> full<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.090> insects<00:06:27.480> and<00:06:27.660> things

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
from getting full of insects and things

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.540 
from getting full of insects and things
like<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.020> so<00:06:29.720> we<00:06:30.720> want<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:30.990> wait<00:06:31.140> 10<00:06:31.770> 14<00:06:32.340> days

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
like that so we want to wait 10 14 days

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.830 
like that so we want to wait 10 14 days
somewhere<00:06:32.940> in<00:06:33.030> there<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.330> then<00:06:33.480> we'll<00:06:33.630> take<00:06:33.780> a

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
somewhere in there and then we'll take a

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.140 
somewhere in there and then we'll take a
sample<00:06:34.170> and<00:06:34.500> that<00:06:35.280> should<00:06:35.460> be<00:06:35.580> a<00:06:35.610> very

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
sample and that should be a very

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.660 
sample and that should be a very
real-world<00:06:36.510> sample<00:06:37.380> of<00:06:37.560> whether<00:06:38.340> or<00:06:38.430> not<00:06:38.490> the

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
real-world sample of whether or not the

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.500 
real-world sample of whether or not the
water<00:06:39.000> is<00:06:39.270> bacteria<00:06:39.990> logically<00:06:40.410> safe<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:42.390> if

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
water is bacteria logically safe and if

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.260 
water is bacteria logically safe and if
it<00:06:42.600> is<00:06:42.750> we're<00:06:43.020> done<00:06:43.470> if<00:06:43.740> it<00:06:44.250> comes<00:06:44.490> back<00:06:44.670> unsafe

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
it is we're done if it comes back unsafe

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.590 
it is we're done if it comes back unsafe
or<00:06:45.570> total<00:06:46.410> coliform<00:06:46.890> positive<00:06:47.390> then<00:06:48.390> we'll

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
or total coliform positive then we'll

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.990 
or total coliform positive then we'll
have<00:06:48.810> to<00:06:49.190> disinfect<00:06:50.190> the<00:06:50.460> well<00:06:50.610> again<00:06:50.880> a

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
have to disinfect the well again a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.510 
have to disinfect the well again a
second<00:06:51.360> time
