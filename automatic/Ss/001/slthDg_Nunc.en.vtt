00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
would have been lead man and he did I

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.870 
would have been lead man and he did I
think<00:03:52.390> was<00:03:52.569> just<00:03:52.870> about<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:54.010> jump<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.580> line

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
think was just about to jump that line

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.059 
think was just about to jump that line
right<00:03:55.239> there<00:03:55.450> if<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:55.720> do<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.989> course<00:03:56.019> that's<00:03:56.860> a

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
right there if you do of course that's a

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.430 
right there if you do of course that's a
DQ<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.880> puts<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.300> different<00:03:58.599> spot<00:03:58.810> but

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
DQ and it puts in a different spot but

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.070 
DQ and it puts in a different spot but
again<00:03:59.709> he<00:03:59.860> wanted<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.400> inside<00:04:00.790> line<00:04:01.030> he<00:04:01.720> won

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
again he wanted that inside line he won

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.259 
again he wanted that inside line he won
the<00:04:02.260> heat<00:04:02.470> race<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.010> as<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.160> result<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:04.090> his

the heat race and as a result that his

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.130 
the heat race and as a result that his
choice<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:05.019> he's<00:04:05.170> out<00:04:05.380> front<00:04:06.690> 331<00:04:07.690> Steven

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
choice and he's out front 331 Steven

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.740 
choice and he's out front 331 Steven
hump<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.590> in<00:04:08.709> second<00:04:09.190> place<00:04:09.220> he<00:04:10.120> got<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> good

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
hump and in second place he got a good

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.740 
hump and in second place he got a good
start<00:04:11.200> there<00:04:11.440> had<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.709> lead<00:04:12.040> briefly<00:04:12.750> before

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
start there had to lead briefly before

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.570 
start there had to lead briefly before
Josh<00:04:14.019> Decker<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:14.650> drove<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.069> right<00:04:15.100> and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
Josh Decker just drove it right and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.020 
Josh Decker just drove it right and
underneath<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:16.440> pretty<00:04:17.440> much<00:04:17.620> all<00:04:17.859> little<00:04:18.190> 50cc

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
underneath a pretty much all little 50cc

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.759 
underneath a pretty much all little 50cc
if<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.329> take<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.540> look<00:04:19.720> at<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.930> differences<00:04:20.470> in

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
if you take a look at the differences in

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.520 
if you take a look at the differences in
the<00:04:21.010> frames<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:22.600> can<00:04:22.750> see<00:04:22.930> some<00:04:23.200> they're<00:04:23.320> just

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
the frames you can see some they're just

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.140 
the frames you can see some they're just
a<00:04:23.650> little<00:04:23.919> bit<00:04:24.010> bigger<00:04:24.190> some<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:24.910> height

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
a little bit bigger some of the height

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.540 
a little bit bigger some of the height
of<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.479> tires<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.260> some<00:04:26.919> of<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.040> tires<00:04:27.340> are

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
of the tires and some of the tires are

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.210 
of the tires and some of the tires are
bit<00:04:27.700> more<00:04:27.910> narrow<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.870> me<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.470> would<00:04:29.979> think<00:04:30.010> a

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
bit more narrow to me I would think a

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.640 
bit more narrow to me I would think a
narrow<00:04:30.490> tire<00:04:30.910> would<00:04:31.120> be<00:04:31.270> this<00:04:31.900> advantageous

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
narrow tire would be this advantageous

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.400 
narrow tire would be this advantageous
here<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.370> think<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.060> want<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.479> little<00:04:35.229> bit

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
here I think you want the little bit

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.560 
here I think you want the little bit
more<00:04:35.590> wider<00:04:35.979> tire<00:04:36.400> for<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.270> grip

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
more wider tire for the grip

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.240 
more wider tire for the grip
particularly<00:04:38.290> when<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.470> run<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> blonde<00:04:38.919> hair

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
particularly when you run a blonde hair

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.270 
particularly when you run a blonde hair
and<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:39.940> only<00:04:40.060> get<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.360> two<00:04:41.350> studs<00:04:41.680> per<00:04:41.979> spot

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
and you only get to two studs per spot

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.309 
and you only get to two studs per spot
on<00:04:42.460> there

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
on there

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.499 
on there
I<00:04:43.349> agree<00:04:44.249> with<00:04:44.399> you<00:04:44.490> hundred<00:04:44.580> percent<00:04:45.089> and<00:04:45.360> you

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
I agree with you hundred percent and you

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.389 
I agree with you hundred percent and you
