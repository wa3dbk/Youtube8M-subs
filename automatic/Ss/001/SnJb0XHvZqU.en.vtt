00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.750 
stuff for them in the present we made a
few<00:00:57.930> twists<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.680> understand<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
few twists but we understand that this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
few twists but we understand that this
is<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> seventh<00:01:00.719> game<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> story<00:01:02.129> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is the seventh game so the story is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.630 
is the seventh game so the story is
becoming<00:01:02.910> complicated<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.899> such<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:05.250> wanted

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
becoming complicated as such we wanted

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
becoming complicated as such we wanted
to<00:01:05.670> reintroduce<00:01:06.270> some<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> main<00:01:07.260> elements

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of the narrated in a different way so

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.190 
of the narrated in a different way so
what<00:01:10.860> does<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.340> mean<00:01:11.630> well<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:13.020> a
