8800<00:04:01.170> mobile<00:04:01.380> GTS<00:04:01.680> which<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:03.150> same

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
8800 mobile GTS which is just the same

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.930 
8800 mobile GTS which is just the same
architecture<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.470> different<00:04:04.770> chip<00:04:04.950> this

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
architecture just a different chip this

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.580 
architecture just a different chip this
actually<00:04:06.180> does<00:04:06.540> do<00:04:06.720> sound<00:04:07.020> over<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> HDMI

actually does do sound over the HDMI

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.140 
actually does do sound over the HDMI
which<00:04:07.740> is<00:04:07.830> great<00:04:08.010> deal<00:04:08.160> older<00:04:08.430> ones<00:04:08.730> did<00:04:08.910> not

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
which is great deal older ones did not

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.140 
which is great deal older ones did not
so<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.140> nice<00:04:10.290> upgrade<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:11.430> also<00:04:11.610> ESAT

hurricanes<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:15.700> battery<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.990> battery

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
hurricanes and the battery this battery

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.870 
hurricanes and the battery this battery
mind<00:05:17.620> you<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.740> you<00:05:17.980> know<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.220> laptop<00:05:18.400> is<00:05:18.580> a

mind you that you know this laptop is a

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.340 
mind you that you know this laptop is a
monster<00:05:19.330> it's<00:05:19.480> got<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.630> quad<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.050> course<00:05:20.200> got

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
monster it's got a quad of course got

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.220 
monster it's got a quad of course got
four<00:05:20.620> gigs<00:05:20.830> of<00:05:20.980> ddr3<00:05:21.370> sort<00:05:22.300> of<00:05:22.360> 500<00:05:22.840> get<00:05:22.930> harder

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
four gigs of ddr3 sort of 500 get harder

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.860 
four gigs of ddr3 sort of 500 get harder
and<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.470> huge<00:05:23.860> video<00:05:24.010> card<00:05:24.370> obviously<00:05:25.210> it's

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
and a huge video card obviously it's

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.000 
and a huge video card obviously it's
going<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.110> waste<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.380> lot<00:05:26.500> of<00:05:26.560> power<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:26.860> this

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
going to waste a lot of power but this

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.240 
going to waste a lot of power but this
is<00:05:27.100> a<00:05:27.130> ninth<00:05:27.610> cell<00:05:28.169> lithium<00:05:29.169> ion<00:05:29.590> battery<00:05:30.160> so

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
is a ninth cell lithium ion battery so

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.620 
is a ninth cell lithium ion battery so
you're<00:05:30.340> probably<00:05:30.430> get<00:05:30.760> about<00:05:30.850> three<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.480> three

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
you're probably get about three to three

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.230 
you're probably get about three to three
and<00:05:31.660> a<00:05:31.750> half<00:05:31.780> hours<00:05:32.200> even<00:05:32.890> on<00:05:33.130> this

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
and a half hours even on this

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.610 
and a half hours even on this
ridiculously<00:05:34.240> powerful<00:05:34.540> laptop<00:05:34.960> just<00:05:35.380> off

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
ridiculously powerful laptop just off

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.969 
ridiculously powerful laptop just off
that<00:05:35.950> battery<00:05:36.760> right<00:05:37.000> there<00:05:37.240> so<00:05:37.770> very<00:05:38.770> nice

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
that battery right there so very nice

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.050 
that battery right there so very nice
it's<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.460> Gateway<00:05:39.790> p<00:05:40.180> 7808<00:05:40.960> u<00:05:41.460> FX<00:05:42.460> series<00:05:42.760> so

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
it's the Gateway p 7808 u FX series so

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.969 
it's the Gateway p 7808 u FX series so
it's<00:05:43.210> still<00:05:43.720> 17<00:05:44.140> inch<00:05:44.290> a<00:05:44.500> little<00:05:44.800> bit<00:05:44.890> low

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
it's still 17 inch a little bit low

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:45.900 
it's still 17 inch a little bit low
resolution<00:05:45.400> you're<00:05:45.490> going<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.669> get<00:05:45.729> better

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910
