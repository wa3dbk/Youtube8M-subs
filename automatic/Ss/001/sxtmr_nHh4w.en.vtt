00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
hey what up who's his brand AKA Moses

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.030 
hey what up who's his brand AKA Moses
print<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.540> house<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.019> today<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:13.980> going

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
print in the house and today I'm going

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860 
print in the house and today I'm going
to<00:00:14.160> show<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.400> how<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> create<00:00:14.759> fire<00:00:15.480> like<00:00:15.839> this

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
to show you how to create fire like this

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.800 
to show you how to create fire like this
in<00:00:16.350> After<00:00:16.710> Effects<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.359> yeah<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.600> there

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
in After Effects and yeah I know there

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.929 
in After Effects and yeah I know there
are<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> few<00:00:19.109> tutorials<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.770> YouTube<00:00:20.010> how<00:00:20.100> how

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
are a few tutorials on YouTube how how

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.730 
are a few tutorials on YouTube how how
to<00:00:21.000> create<00:00:21.359> fire<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:22.410> i'm<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to create fire but i'm going to show you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.500 
to create fire but i'm going to show you
this<00:00:22.980> technique<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.910> i<00:00:23.939> personally<00:00:24.180> found

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this technique that i personally found

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.640 
this technique that i personally found
very<00:00:24.810> impressive<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.470> very<00:00:25.560> nice<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.660> let's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
very impressive and very nice so let's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
very impressive and very nice so let's
get<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> create<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> new

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
get right into it and create a new

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.959 
get right into it and create a new
composition<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:32.070> call<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> composition

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
composition and call the composition

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.670 
composition and call the composition
fire<00:00:34.460> 720<00:00:35.460> x<00:00:35.579> 480<00:00:36.030> works<00:00:36.420> well<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.350> okay

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
fire 720 x 480 works well and it okay

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
fire 720 x 480 works well and it okay
and<00:00:39.020> create<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.230> new<00:00:40.290> solid<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:42.719> color<00:00:42.989> doesn't

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and create a new solid the color doesn't

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.069 
and create a new solid the color doesn't
matter<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.829> i'm<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> call<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> solid<00:00:45.079> particles

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
matter but i'm a call to solid particles

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.709 
matter but i'm a call to solid particles
because<00:00:46.590> we're<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> use<00:00:47.270> particles<00:00:48.270> for

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because we're going to use particles for

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.680 
because we're going to use particles for
this<00:00:49.020> effect<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.680> hit<00:00:49.770> OK<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:51.320> next<00:00:52.320> type<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.860> CC

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
this effect and hit OK a next type in CC

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.130 
this effect and hit OK a next type in CC
particle<00:00:54.690> world<00:00:56.120> take<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.329> drop<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> onto<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
particle world take it drop it onto the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
particle world take it drop it onto the
particles<00:00:58.649> layer<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> don't<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.879> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
particles layer if you don't have this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
particles layer if you don't have this
plugin<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.449> should<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.719> somewhere<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.260> at

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
plugin it should be somewhere on your at

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.210 
plugin it should be somewhere on your at
FX<00:01:02.309> installation<00:01:02.850> disk<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.650> yeah<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:05.010> need<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
FX installation disk and yeah we need to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
FX installation disk and yeah we need to
make<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.519> adjustments<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.270> make<00:01:06.479> those

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
make some adjustments to make those

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.219 
make some adjustments to make those
particles<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.920> fire<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.110> first<00:01:10.110> time

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
particles look like fire and first time

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.730 
particles look like fire and first time
I<00:01:10.290> change<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> grid<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.479> from<00:01:13.080> floor<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> off

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I change the grid to from floor to off

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.499 
I change the grid to from floor to off
so<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.100> don't<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.700> soul<00:01:14.880> extra<00:01:15.270> stuff

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so we don't see the soul extra stuff

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.790 
so we don't see the soul extra stuff
there<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:18.229> fit<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> 100

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
there and fit up to 100

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.630 
there and fit up to 100
and<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:22.420> go<00:01:22.660> down<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:22.990> physics<00:01:23.640> change

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
and I'm go down to the physics change

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.760 
and I'm go down to the physics change
the<00:01:24.790> animation<00:01:24.910> from<00:01:25.420> explosive<00:01:26.320> fire

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
the animation from explosive fire

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.010 
the animation from explosive fire
because<00:01:27.610> that's<00:01:28.000> what<00:01:28.270> we're<00:01:28.450> creating<00:01:28.660> right

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
because that's what we're creating right

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.490 
because that's what we're creating right
and<00:01:33.030> bring<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.150> producer<00:01:34.600> down<00:01:34.900> so<00:01:35.230> that<00:01:35.260> we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
and bring the producer down so that we

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.250 
and bring the producer down so that we
don't<00:01:35.620> get<00:01:35.740> cut<00:01:35.980> off<00:01:36.100> right<00:01:36.340> there<00:01:36.520> at<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.670> top

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
don't get cut off right there at the top

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.430 
don't get cut off right there at the top
so<00:01:38.260> change<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.430> Y<00:01:39.580> position<00:01:41.790> point<00:01:42.930> 35<00:01:43.930> 36

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
so change the Y position point 35 36

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.170 
so change the Y position point 35 36
should<00:01:44.860> be<00:01:45.010> okay<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.550> I'm<00:01:45.670> increase<00:01:46.030> the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
should be okay and I'm increase the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.340 
should be okay and I'm increase the
radius<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.720> index<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.630> something<00:01:50.110> right

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
radius of index to something right

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.320 
radius of index to something right
around<00:01:50.560> point2<00:01:52.980> yeah<00:01:53.980> close<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.520> that's<00:01:55.180> all

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
around point2 yeah close that that's all

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.320 
around point2 yeah close that that's all
we<00:01:55.420> have<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.630> do<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.930> producer<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:57.330> will

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
we have to do to the producer and I will

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.040 
we have to do to the producer and I will
change<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.630> velocity<00:01:58.720> to<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:01.030> point<00:02:01.510> five

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
change the velocity to about point five

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.360 
change the velocity to about point five
and<00:02:03.300> yeah<00:02:04.300> I'll<00:02:04.420> leave<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> rest<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:05.050> it<00:02:05.170> is

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
and yeah I'll leave the rest as it is

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.230 
and yeah I'll leave the rest as it is
and<00:02:06.660> now<00:02:07.660> go<00:02:07.840> down<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.200> particles

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
and now go down to the particles

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.110 
and now go down to the particles
increase<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.330> particle<00:02:11.020> type<00:02:12.000> increase<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
increase the particle type increase the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.950 
increase the particle type increase the
particle<00:02:13.600> type<00:02:14.250> change<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.690> change<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.780> to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
particle type change it change it to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.840 
particle type change it change it to
bubble<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:20.250> yeah<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.370> need<00:02:21.490> some<00:02:21.550> more

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
bubble and yeah we need some more

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.370 
bubble and yeah we need some more
bubbles<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.360> I'm<00:02:22.480> gonna<00:02:22.660> increase<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.170> birth

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
bubbles so I'm gonna increase the birth

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.740 
bubbles so I'm gonna increase the birth
rate<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:26.220> yes<00:02:27.220> something<00:02:27.670> around<00:02:27.850> 16<00:02:28.390> for<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
rate and yes something around 16 for the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.050 
rate and yes something around 16 for the
work<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:31.690> down<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.620> color<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.700> want<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
work go down to the color I want to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.240 
work go down to the color I want to
change<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.420> color<00:02:34.660> i<00:02:34.750> found<00:02:35.050> out<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:36.190> you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
change the color i found out that if you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.900 
change the color i found out that if you
type<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.880> here<00:02:37.060> 100<00:02:37.690> and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.480 

4g<00:02:41.910> green<00:02:43.040> 235<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.310> get<00:02:44.520> some<00:02:45.680> nice<00:02:46.680> yellowish

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
4g green 235 you get some nice yellowish

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.890 
4g green 235 you get some nice yellowish
color<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.680> four<00:02:50.210> for<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.360> red<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.750> want

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
color and four for the red I just want

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.850 
color and four for the red I just want
to<00:02:51.960> use<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> brighter<00:02:52.410> red<00:02:52.560> color<00:02:54.320> yeah<00:02:55.320> that

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
to use a brighter red color yeah that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.200 
to use a brighter red color yeah that
works<00:02:56.100> well<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.490> close<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:57.000> that's

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
works well and close this that's

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.460 
works well and close this that's
basically<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.350> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
basically all we have to do to the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.450 
basically all we have to do to the
particles<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.440> next<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.950> want<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> create

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
particles and the next I want to create

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.690 
particles and the next I want to create
a<00:03:02.520> new<00:03:02.730> adjustment<00:03:02.910> layer<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.430> want<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
a new adjustment layer that I want to

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.610 
a new adjustment layer that I want to
apply<00:03:05.880> effects<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.570> make<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.590> know

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
apply effects to to make it you know

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.170 
apply effects to to make it you know
look<00:03:07.890> more<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.250> fire<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.880> apply<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
look more like fire you can apply the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.110 
look more like fire you can apply the
effect<00:03:09.360> directly<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.110> particles<00:03:10.650> layer

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
effect directly to the particles layer

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
effect directly to the particles layer
but<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.150> want<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> use<00:03:12.540> an<00:03:12.660> adjustment<00:03:12.990> layer

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
but I want to use an adjustment layer

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.020 
but I want to use an adjustment layer
just<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.400> bit<00:03:14.580> more<00:03:14.730> control

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
just to have a little bit more control

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.800 
just to have a little bit more control
over<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.480> effects<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:17.400> next<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.450> want<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.660> use<00:03:18.780> a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
over the effects so next I want to use a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.780 
over the effects so next I want to use a
cc<00:03:19.380> vector<00:03:20.070> blur<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:23.250> effect<00:03:23.580> actually

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
cc vector blur and this effect actually

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.880 
cc vector blur and this effect actually
does<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.300> whole<00:03:24.450> trick<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:24.930> apply<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
does the whole trick so apply to the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.680 
does the whole trick so apply to the
adjustment<00:03:26.280> layer<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:27.210> can<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
adjustment layer and we can see that

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.260 
adjustment layer and we can see that
absolutely<00:03:28.350> nothing<00:03:28.770> happens<00:03:29.130> because<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
absolutely nothing happens because the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.570 
absolutely nothing happens because the
amount<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.750> 0<00:03:31.020> so<00:03:31.950> I'm<00:03:32.070> going<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.220> change<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
amount is 0 so I'm going to change the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.120 
amount is 0 so I'm going to change the
amount<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.960> 10<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:36.120> whole<00:03:36.960> fish<00:03:39.380> 10<00:03:40.380> not

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
amount to 10 and the whole fish 10 not

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.350 
amount to 10 and the whole fish 10 not
100<00:03:42.440> yeah<00:03:43.440> sorry<00:03:43.800> about<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.040> ok<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.940> 10<00:03:45.150> and

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
the yeah we can see a nice effect let me

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.480 
the yeah we can see a nice effect let me
just<00:03:48.570> change<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.930> hair<00:03:49.110> press<00:03:51.350> but

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
just change the hair press but

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.340 
just change the hair press but
I<00:03:53.580> want<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.240> apply<00:03:54.420> some<00:03:54.630> more<00:03:54.810> effects<00:03:55.170> to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
I want to apply some more effects to

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.100 
I want to apply some more effects to
make<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> look<00:03:55.890> even<00:03:56.070> better<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.300> apply<00:03:57.660> fast

blur<00:03:59.240> to<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.420> adjustment<00:04:00.900> layer<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.490> change

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
blur to the adjustment layer and change

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.570 
blur to the adjustment layer and change
the<00:04:02.760> blur<00:04:02.940> dimensions<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:04.010> vertical<00:04:05.010> only<00:04:05.340> and

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
the blur dimensions to vertical only and

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.950 
the blur dimensions to vertical only and
increase<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.670> blurriness<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.270> about<00:04:09.720> five

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
increase the blurriness to about five

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.090 
increase the blurriness to about five
just<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.050> give<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.470> know<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> little<00:04:13.950> bit

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
just to give it a you know a little bit

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.140 
just to give it a you know a little bit
more<00:04:14.280> fiery<00:04:14.730> feeling<00:04:15.560> whatever<00:04:16.560> thing<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.900 

the<00:04:21.150> last<00:04:21.360> effect<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.840> want<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.080> apply<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.350> to

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
the last effect I want to apply is to

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.470 
the last effect I want to apply is to
glow<00:04:25.220> because<00:04:26.220> fire<00:04:26.700> glows<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.540> know

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
glow because fire glows you know

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.790 
glow because fire glows you know
increase<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.600> threshold<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:33.800> something

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
increase the threshold to something

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.760 
increase the threshold to something
around<00:04:35.010> 90<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:37.020> radius<00:04:38.720> 250<00:04:39.720> maybe<00:04:39.930> maybe

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
around 90 and the radius 250 maybe maybe

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.360 
around 90 and the radius 250 maybe maybe
more<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.700> can<00:04:41.850> play<00:04:42.030> with<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.330> settings<00:04:43.370> to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
more you can play with the settings to

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.519 
more you can play with the settings to
get<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.760> look<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.150> want

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.709 

and<00:04:48.619> yeah<00:04:49.249> right<00:04:49.519> away<00:04:49.699> we<00:04:49.879> can<00:04:49.999> see<00:04:50.029> some<00:04:50.599> very

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
and yeah right away we can see some very

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.249 
and yeah right away we can see some very
nice<00:04:50.989> fiery<00:04:51.499> effect<00:04:52.129> but<00:04:52.929> you<00:04:53.929> may<00:04:54.109> have

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
nice fiery effect but you may have

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.439 
nice fiery effect but you may have
noticed<00:04:54.769> that<00:04:54.859> we<00:04:55.039> right<00:04:55.579> here<00:04:55.609> at<00:04:55.879> the<00:04:55.969> top<00:04:55.999> or

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
noticed that we right here at the top or

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.379 
noticed that we right here at the top or
the<00:04:56.509> size<00:04:57.409> we<00:04:57.439> can<00:04:57.709> see<00:04:58.159> we<00:04:58.819> can<00:04:58.969> still<00:04:59.149> see<00:04:59.359> the

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
the size we can see we can still see the

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.439 
the size we can see we can still see the
bubbles<00:05:00.009> you<00:05:01.009> know<00:05:01.159> maybe<00:05:01.759> that's<00:05:02.029> okay<00:05:02.329> if

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
bubbles you know maybe that's okay if

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.369 
bubbles you know maybe that's okay if
you<00:05:02.539> want<00:05:02.719> that<00:05:02.989> but<00:05:03.199> I<00:05:03.489> want<00:05:04.489> to<00:05:04.549> change<00:05:04.729> it<00:05:04.939> so

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379 
you want that but I want to change it so

to fix it that problem I want to just

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.769 
to fix it that problem I want to just
increase<00:05:08.929> the<00:05:09.049> blurriness<00:05:10.269> maybe<00:05:11.269> the<00:05:11.449> vector

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
increase the blurriness maybe the vector
