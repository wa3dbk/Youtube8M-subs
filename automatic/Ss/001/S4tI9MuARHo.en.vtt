00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I will start by applying a clear shadow to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 illuminate in this case this sample of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.250
 sedona leis by the way I speak clearly 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.139
 because I do not get lost the retainers 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.210
 because I've been like two days without getting 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.950
 the good thing to illuminate is that it helps 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.450
 disguise all the hairs that I do not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 they have removed from here but they are very 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 shorts then it's very difficult I apply it 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.939
 here but without taking more products what 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.619
 I am here, keep in mind that 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.160
 I wanted in many spaces but in life 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 Real is not like that is because of the excess light 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.349
 I would like to do as a video for 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 makeup for photos or media things that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.610
 regardless of how much light you put it 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.530
 see the perfect eyebrows of those 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.840
 sufficiently defined and things like that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.270
 because indeed the makeup 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 normal does not look the same in real life 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.250
 that in the camera now use the pencil 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 and a body mix in milk that is simply 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 the white tone and I'll put it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 around the mobile eyelid do not need 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 Be careful 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 by the way I put the tape here but 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.600
 as long as they are with the tapes there 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 do this movement because you can 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 lift if they are going to do something on the edge 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 we must do so the movement 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 contrary to not rise now 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 with his finger the blur now of the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.190
 palette take me to brazil I will use 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.530
 these two are here and here but 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.380
 also a little bit bright I do not want 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
 that is vibrant and matte but who would be 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
 call attention because this 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 makeup will be very easy I need something 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.080
 that draw attention should be fine 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.759
 loaded and I'll apply it here, look here 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 the basin is passed a little and there is no 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.539
 problem as long as it's like the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 half for outside that you know is to say here 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.390
 try not to spend so much now 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.789
 I will use a medium angular brush not 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.970
 so small and use this tone here 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.360
 of corrector to make a delineated efe 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.119
 use do not use this tone here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.920
 of the concealer or something creamy just 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.750
 is to give dimension to the eyes 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.570
 I will do 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.610
 a delineated with tail that like this neither 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.940
 note the thing is that the tail should 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.250
 end here just before that line 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.420
 of the basin just before the division 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.420
 to finish there 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.510
 ouch that's what happens when you 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 Make up looking at the floor now with this 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.549
 color here of the beige palette 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.829
 cosmetics the san francisco I will spend 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.040
 above all that with the same 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.040
 brush 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.430
 Now with the same shadow and a brush 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.900
 that allows you to apply the shadow of the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.690
 basin up and not stain anything 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.940
 this here I'm going to apply it 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.980
 from the basin up like the tail 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.440
 came here it is , you should go 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.390
 finish the tail and start so that it 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.040
 see how once I will try to apply it 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.050
 about halfway after having 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.790
 applied 5 is more products you can 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.470
 take a little more forward the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.200
 chare a little bit more here because here 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.510
 there was enough and with a brush to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.250
 blur I'll blur if you do like 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.470
 I ended up adding more man 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.930
 here simply find you 'do not hurt 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.030
 the line and do not even think about putting the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.860
 brush in the basin because you'll finish 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.330
 joining the colors but from the basin 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.250
 upwards although I just fell into 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.780
 mind that on this side is that the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.000
 light so maybe that's why in the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.250
 camera would look darker because in 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.540
 person you see equality is funny but 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.540
 now yes blur this side 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.880
 after this I can remove the tape 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.159
 if you want you can touch up the base here 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.799
 I'm going to apply the proofreader and I'm going to 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.390
 seal everything with translucent powder alone 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.700
 a little bit and it's going to touch now with the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.709
 black shadow that brings the palette and a 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.140
 small gap I'm going to make a line 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.480
 thin simply to define the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.430
 eyes and make eyelashes look much more 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.650
 full and I will not take it here 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.480
 simply to where they end 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.450
 thicker eyelashes that's like 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.610
 up to this point 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.340
 now I will clean the brush that I had used 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.110
 to do the above outlined as 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.230
 can see right now clean it here and not 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.209
 I'll take that collector but be here 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.879
 I will try to make a delicate line 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.739
 right here and will get here and what 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.739
 I will continue with the same shadow of the basin 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.780
 since I'm finishing with this brush 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.350
 very very tiny I will apply on the line 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.510
 of water and here to illuminate the base 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.520
 white after this brooch is that I do not 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.280
 leave the white line but if it helps me 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.420
 remove like these dark or things 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.420
 reds that are there 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.830
 sir this here with this shadow 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.380
 white that has some glitter like 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.380
 golden only that very small and is 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.140
 brush I will simply put it here 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.210
 and now to finish the eyes and I will use my 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.760
 eyelashes and I'll apply lash as 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.440
 I will always apply the basic cosmetics 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.940
 which is my favorite right now I think that 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.790
 it had never been so difficult 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.070
 Retainers talking to posts 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.200
 now as for the face I will use the 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.750
 blush and bronzer of him but 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.840
 only the bronzer and contour e 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.300
 a little 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.590
 and they were here to see me as soon not 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.590
 also use here 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:20.020
 now with you he is using him 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.360
 is the bathed floral in tone airs 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.099
 is very pigment then have in 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.990
 mind that if you are careful since the 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.939
 please that totally intense I will go with 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.310
 the most natural lipstick possible 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:33.699
 very cute with your eyes or with any 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.600
 golden yellow tone is matte lipstick 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:40.620
 of mix in euro back 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:46.490
 I'll use a lip gloss on him in the 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.490
 pink nude tone only in the center 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.199
 the reason why I made the line 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.509
 thin black above is to define 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.370
 but I wanted more definition and I did not want 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.960
 use of linear inside because 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.610
 I want the eyes to be bigger so 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.620
 that to define a little more you can use 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.509
 false eyelashes because it is 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.840
 definitely it makes eyes 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:11.020
 look bigger and I use like five 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.360
 individual eyelashes in each eye to 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.940
 that looks very natural only that with 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.979
 my bad aim I made a point where no 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.419
 was and to fix it because it gives me 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.580
 time to remove it I simply did 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.550
 another two points and three points remained 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.660
 about the eyeliner and it looks great 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.460
 recursion so that's all 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.080
 remember to follow me on twitter in 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.849
 instagram give my page my 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.039
 facebook and if you want you can add me 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.750
 as a friend on facebook also in 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.430
 facebook there is an album of photos that are 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.710
 the makeups of course do not taste 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.750
 animals that I sell and today they are in 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.940
 promotion the delineators of djs and 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.710
 cosmetics because I'm doing a 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.590
 draw for the 10,000 subscribers in 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.139
 all you have 15% discount but today

 just in the delineators you have 25 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.080
 so that 's all a kiss until the 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.080
 next video
