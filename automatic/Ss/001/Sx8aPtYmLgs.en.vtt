 the special circumstances used to study 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.419
 and to pursue an independent occupation 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:20.029
 after women initially only at the philosophical and medical 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.879
 Faculty were admitted 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.110

 of nearly 20 percent of all enrolled 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.530

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.419
 the role of the woman as a housewife and mother was propagated 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.680
 they engaged applicants to the Reichsarbeitsdienst 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.679
 and hampered the university entrance qualification 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.199
 the proportion of female always rescue Tripoli
