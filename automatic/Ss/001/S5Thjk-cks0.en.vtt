00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
code right here I'm going to change that

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.970 
code right here I'm going to change that
to<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:25.220> dark<00:03:26.220> black<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.650> there<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:28.769> go

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
to just a dark black and there we go

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.190 
to just a dark black and there we go
that's<00:03:29.370> how<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.700> do<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.150> I'm<00:03:30.540> going<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.989> put

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
that's how you do it I'm going to put

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.690 
that's how you do it I'm going to put
all<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.709> code<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:33.750> child<00:03:34.080> theme<00:03:34.440> file<00:03:35.070> on

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
all this code in a child theme file on

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.850 
all this code in a child theme file on
my<00:03:35.970> site<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.900> copy<00:03:37.170> all<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
my site so you can just copy all the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.680 
my site so you can just copy all the
different<00:03:38.670> codes<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.450> I'll

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
different codes that you like I'll

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.870 
different codes that you like I'll
identify<00:03:40.230> all<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.560> codes<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:41.100> my<00:03:41.250> child<00:03:41.580> theme

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
identify all the codes in my child theme

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.410 
identify all the codes in my child theme
so<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.780> will<00:03:42.900> look<00:03:43.110> something<00:03:44.100> just<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.880> this

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
so it will look something just like this

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.199 
so it will look something just like this
and<00:03:45.900> there'll<00:03:46.440> be<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.860> line<00:03:47.549> above<00:03:47.910> this

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
and there'll be a little line above this

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.229 
and there'll be a little line above this
which<00:03:48.450> will<00:03:48.660> say<00:03:48.989> which<00:03:49.680> code<00:03:50.010> changes<00:03:50.880> which

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
which will say which code changes which

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.990 
which will say which code changes which
so<00:03:51.930> if<00:03:52.080> you'd<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.470> copy<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.580> child

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
