00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.849
 ding dong 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.190
 yes hello come in who's this me about 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.839
 buddy hi see your eyes 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.060
 happy come on now drink some tea 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:25.189
 just wait a little bit here nothing 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.189
 touch I have tea for a bed of chests 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 mate I told you nothing 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 touch friends hello everyone is a mechanism 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 for trolling 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 next part with me today is denver 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.930
 the horizon is gone somewhere we are taking 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.739
 decided to record the mechanisms for trolling 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.719
 before DN and in general today 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.910
 Let's show another mechanism like this 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.129
 he looks when a person comes up 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.059
 I decided to look at something from the chest 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.250
 immediately on the walls just instantly 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.289
 taper and dude squeezes there like in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 vise well what in general let me tell you 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.890
 I will show by example 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 we will restore it all back to 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.229
 initial size can listen 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.750
 a little chest put yes yes and honde good and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.700
 But in general, I enter my own hut. 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 youtube means hut 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.640
 and in short, I â€™m trying to dig around 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.520
 the chest and then bang is shorter than the wall 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 instantly taper and shorter than me 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 so here heals and I'm gradually dying in 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 principle if you are not at peace complexity 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 before then you will quickly die we are now 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.229
 put the hart and the principle here and so 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 all quickly well, that in general, the mechanism 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 understandable and now we will show how he 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 how it is built and how everything is built 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.270
 the rest I now give the word to Denver 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.799
 dealer let's tell believe 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.689
 forward so here are the masses themselves actually 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.770
 a chest like this 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.140
 this is the outer part 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 and what lies below the hips show 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.600
 we open the chest redstone signal 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.409
 passes and activates the first three teams 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.969
 block at the bottom all commands blocks are sounds 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.579
 which are characteristic in general when 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.570
 the walls start moving in 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.580
 command blocks can not open well 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 understood everything 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.840
 teams will also be in the description yes we all 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 write this to you 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.489
 now all show just command blocks 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.010
 where is that then tell me about the top 2 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.200
 block teams go they clone the wall 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 These are the walls that will be behind. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.560
 move and he plans to coordinate 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.110
 forward thereby they 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.360
 move move and move and 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.190
 and the person's general it is repeated in 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.019
 the following command zuber class here I am 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.519
 see repeats repeats repeats 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.560
 in general, as you understood in all 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.390
 the rest of the command block here again you 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 I will show in all other command 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 blocks 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.400
 those that go right here they are all 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.950
 the same commands are repeated in general 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.110
 I remind all the commands in the description 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.000
 you can come and see the dream come on 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.709
 even once we test yes friends 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.870
 By the way, do not forget to put on a new one. 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.890
 release like yes because i think you 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.079
 waited and in general 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.510
 we will try to do more now 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.640
 more more more mechanisms 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.160
 for trolling now I will try of course 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.140
 I know I 'll try, I'll try to get out. 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.540
 more from this mechanism but you know friends 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.030
 if a person has no idea what 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.220
 there if he opens the chest there will be walls 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.930
 taper principle he won't even have time 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.430
 react and run out now try 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.190
 somehow get out of here so oh oh oh 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.380
 there i ran out i did it all the same all 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.959
 I got it all the same I got it out 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.150
 in fact friends she is in general 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.889
 then all here is such a mechanism is enough 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.799
 funny if you have any ideas on 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.720
 mechanism then don't forget to write them to 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.340
 me in lichku VKontakte can write 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.410
 You can write in comments also 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.660
 Be sure to subscribe to the channel DNR 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.310
 and the link to his channel is in the description 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.889
 there goes different mechanisms awesome 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.690
 all sorts of things done so let's let 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.269
 that's all there in his description is and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.239
 come see subscribe to it 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.780
 the channel in general was with you I am semchenko 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.250
 and hip hips yes yes yes yes all up to the new 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.250
 good luck yet
