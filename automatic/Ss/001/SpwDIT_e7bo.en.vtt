00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
into it and that's what it takes a lot

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:52.690 
into it and that's what it takes a lot
of<00:02:38.300> times<00:02:48.760> some<00:02:49.760> that's<00:02:50.470> right<00:02:51.470> he's<00:02:51.920> but

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
of times some that's right he's but

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:04.000 
of times some that's right he's but
you're<00:03:02.110> but<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.200> does<00:03:03.410> help<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.860> there's

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
also the more time were together the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.509 
also the more time were together the
more<00:03:06.170> times<00:03:06.440> we<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.709> do<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> more<00:03:07.250> times

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
more times we can do that the more times

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.130 
more times we can do that the more times
we<00:03:07.700> can<00:03:07.790> walk<00:03:07.910> through<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.299> play<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.930> better

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.870 

I<00:03:22.690> can't<00:03:23.690> wait<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.900> get<00:03:24.019> him<00:03:24.140> back<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.880> we

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
I can't wait to get him back and we

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.160 
I can't wait to get him back and we
should<00:03:25.910> go<00:03:26.150> up<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.269> another<00:03:26.510> level<00:03:26.690> there's<00:03:27.049> no

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
should go up to another level there's no

he just has a great pace that you it's

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.760 
he just has a great pace that you it's
hard<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.120> teach<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:37.020> takes<00:04:37.229> years<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.560> do

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
hard to teach and it takes years to do

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.860 
hard to teach and it takes years to do
that<00:04:37.950> but<00:04:38.190> those<00:04:38.910> are<00:04:39.090> things<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.419> unless

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
that but those are things that unless

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.450 
that but those are things that unless
you<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.530> unless<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.889> coach<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.280> player

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
you have and unless you coach a player

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.430 
you have and unless you coach a player
you<00:04:41.610> really<00:04:41.820> don't<00:04:42.030> know<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.510> that's<00:04:42.630> one<00:04:43.410> of

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
you really don't know and that's one of

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.600 
you really don't know and that's one of
the<00:04:43.530> reasons<00:04:43.800> why<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.040> gets<00:04:44.130> overlooked

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
the reasons why it gets overlooked

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.340 
the reasons why it gets overlooked
because<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.120> don't<00:04:45.330> see<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.750> intangibles

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
because you don't see the intangibles

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.940 
because you don't see the intangibles
unless<00:04:46.560> he<00:04:46.770> plays<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:49.500> can't<00:04:49.740> get<00:04:49.860> it

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
unless he plays and you can't get it

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.110 
unless he plays and you can't get it
from<00:04:50.010> a<00:04:50.160> workout<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.580> can't<00:04:50.880> get<00:04:51.000> him

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
from a workout you can't get him

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.790 
from a workout you can't get him
one-on-one<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.990> like<00:04:52.169> certain<00:04:52.560> things

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
can put a lot of control in his hands

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.930 
can put a lot of control in his hands
and<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.590> feel<00:05:15.830> comfortable<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.460> he<00:05:16.580> figures

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
and I feel comfortable that he figures

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.790 
and I feel comfortable that he figures
it<00:05:17.090> out<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.240> he'll<00:05:18.020> even<00:05:18.170> get<00:05:18.410> better<00:05:18.650> and

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
it out and he'll even get better and

better and better he he should have a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.080 
better and better he he should have a
better<00:05:20.420> field<00:05:20.690> again<00:05:20.960> denial<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.970> when<00:05:22.970> that

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
better field again denial and when that

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.030
