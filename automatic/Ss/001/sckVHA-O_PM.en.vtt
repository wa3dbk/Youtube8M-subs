option on the the 15 inch display so
they<00:01:16.520> use<00:01:16.729> different<00:01:17.000> processors<00:01:17.780> from<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.259> and

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
they use different processors from a and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.890 
they use different processors from a and
D<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:18.830> M<00:01:19.040> tell<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.060> depends<00:01:20.360> on<00:01:20.479> what<00:01:20.750> you

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
D and M tell so it depends on what you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.020 
D and M tell so it depends on what you
want<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.040> technology<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.700> you

to customers the most interesting part

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.929 
to customers the most interesting part
of<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.320> experience<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.610> get

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
of this is the experience that you get

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.390 
of this is the experience that you get
with<00:01:32.060> an<00:01:32.210> HP<00:01:32.689> technology<00:01:32.930> or<00:01:33.560> an<00:01:33.650> HP<00:01:33.979> product

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
with an HP technology or an HP product

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.210 
with an HP technology or an HP product
is<00:01:34.549> what<00:01:35.540> actually<00:01:36.079> creates<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.770> different

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
is what actually creates a different

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.539 
is what actually creates a different
user<00:01:37.700> experience<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:40.310> user

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
user experience so and the user

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.399 
user experience so and the user
experience<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.329> what's<00:01:41.540> really<00:01:41.750> important

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
experience is what's really important

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.920 
experience is what's really important
making<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.369> easy<00:01:43.670> for<00:01:43.790> people<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.299> be<00:01:44.450> able<00:01:44.570> to

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
making it easy for people to be able to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.160 
making it easy for people to be able to
use<00:01:45.259> whether<00:01:46.040> you're<00:01:46.310> using<00:01:46.490> Windows<00:01:47.119> 8<00:01:47.420> which

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
use whether you're using Windows 8 which

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.410 
use whether you're using Windows 8 which
is<00:01:48.200> what<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.560> see<00:01:48.770> here<00:01:49.100> or<00:01:49.340> windows<00:01:49.790> seven<00:01:50.240> is

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
is what you see here or windows seven is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.620 
is what you see here or windows seven is
what's<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.320> important<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.790> provide<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
what's so important so you provide the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.210 
what's so important so you provide the
applications<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.530> people<00:01:54.740> are<00:01:55.009> accustomed

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
applications that people are accustomed

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.780 
applications that people are accustomed
to<00:01:55.790> use<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.469> therefore<00:01:57.469> they<00:01:58.130> become<00:01:58.520> more

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
to use and therefore they become more

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.370 
to use and therefore they become more
more

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950 

prolific<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.820> fact<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
prolific in the fact of the the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
prolific in the fact of the the
technology<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.039> use<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.579> all<00:02:05.729> those

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
technology that they use and all those

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.919 
technology that they use and all those
good<00:02:06.119> things<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> these<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.670> part<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
good things so these are all part of a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.220 
good things so these are all part of a
different<00:02:10.440> design<00:02:11.150> philosophy<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.780> you'll

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
different design philosophy so you'll

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.059 
different design philosophy so you'll
see<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.769> very<00:02:14.099> soft<00:02:14.489> touch<00:02:15.590> technology<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.800> this

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
see a very soft touch technology on this

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.729 
see a very soft touch technology on this
you'll<00:02:17.880> actually<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.630> able<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:20.690> find<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:22.140> very

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
you'll actually be able to find a very

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.809 
you'll actually be able to find a very
different<00:02:23.130> look<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> feel<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.780> HP<00:02:25.470> logo<00:02:25.819> pops

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
different look and feel the HP logo pops

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.220 
different look and feel the HP logo pops
differently<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.670> part<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.330> being<00:02:30.630> able

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
differently and it's part of being able

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.289 
differently and it's part of being able
to<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:32.190> look<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.120> feel<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.980> from<00:02:34.980> HP<00:02:35.519> that
