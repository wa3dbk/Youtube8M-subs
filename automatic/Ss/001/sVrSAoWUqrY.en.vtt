00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of the shots were 40 so we'll see why

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660

56<00:02:35.329> rounds<00:02:35.599> per<00:02:35.750> clip<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.170> then<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.500> makes<00:02:36.620> it

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
56 rounds per clip and then it makes it

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.699 
56 rounds per clip and then it makes it
way<00:02:36.980> more<00:02:37.010> fun<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.730> usable<00:02:38.239> in<00:02:38.329> PvE<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:39.470> when

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
way more fun and usable in PvE so when

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.440 
way more fun and usable in PvE so when
looking<00:02:39.980> at<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.280> overall<00:02:40.400> stats<00:02:40.879> look<00:02:41.239> at<00:02:41.359> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
looking at the overall stats look at it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.240 
looking at the overall stats look at it
screams<00:02:41.900> consistency<00:02:42.650> which<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:42.920> what<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.069> like

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
damage for a short time I think that's

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.580 
damage for a short time I think that's
why<00:02:46.159> we<00:02:46.310> saw<00:02:46.549> 40s<00:02:47.150> pop<00:02:47.299> off<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.780> one<00:02:48.260> guy<00:02:48.409> was

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
why we saw 40s pop off that one guy was

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.099 
why we saw 40s pop off that one guy was
