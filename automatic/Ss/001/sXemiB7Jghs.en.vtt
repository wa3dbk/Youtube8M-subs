the<00:01:55.119> course<00:01:55.359> I<00:01:55.570> think<00:01:56.140> that's<00:01:56.320> something<00:01:56.590> that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
the course I think that's something that

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.560 
the course I think that's something that
just<00:01:57.189> hasn't<00:01:57.700> been<00:01:57.939> out<00:01:58.119> there<00:01:58.359> you<00:01:58.479> know

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
nobody really knows what I do personally
