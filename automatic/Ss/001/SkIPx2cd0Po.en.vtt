take two and half seconds to pull up

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.710 
take two and half seconds to pull up
you'd<00:03:52.670> better<00:03:52.850> make<00:03:53.030> sure<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> areas

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.790 

here's<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:00.930> when<00:04:01.080> two<00:04:01.230> players<00:04:01.440> would<00:04:01.650> come

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
here's one when two players would come

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.990 
here's one when two players would come
at<00:04:01.890> each<00:04:02.010> other<00:04:02.160> with<00:04:02.280> chainsaws<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.910> was

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
at each other with chainsaws it was

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.400 
at each other with chainsaws it was
pretty<00:04:03.150> much<00:04:03.300> for<00:04:03.420> random<00:04:03.690> outcome<00:04:03.990> as<00:04:04.140> far<00:04:04.320> as

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
pretty much for random outcome as far as

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.220 
pretty much for random outcome as far as
who<00:04:04.530> would<00:04:04.650> win<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:06.300> here's<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:06.990> actually

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
who would win and here's to we actually

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.470 
who would win and here's to we actually
wanted<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.470> make<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.890> very<00:04:08.580> cinematic<00:04:09.090> and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
wanted to make it a very cinematic and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.210 
wanted to make it a very cinematic and
be<00:04:09.750> have<00:04:10.050> an<00:04:10.170> actual<00:04:10.320> game<00:04:10.590> mechanic<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.130> was

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
be have an actual game mechanic that was

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.600 
be have an actual game mechanic that was
implemented

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.060 

the<00:04:14.480> bottom<00:04:14.750> line<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:14.900> when<00:04:15.170> two<00:04:15.560> characters

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
the bottom line is when two characters

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.560 
the bottom line is when two characters
and<00:04:16.190> gears<00:04:16.340> engage<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> chance<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:17.359> duel

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
and gears engage in a chance that duel

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.979 
and gears engage in a chance that duel
it<00:04:17.690> last<00:04:17.900> babe<00:04:18.230> may<00:04:18.500> scoop<00:04:18.739> two<00:04:19.280> seconds

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
it last babe may scoop two seconds

it last babe may scoop two seconds
sparks<00:04:20.989> are<00:04:21.109> flying<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.680> know<00:04:21.739> the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
sparks are flying and you know the

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.950 
sparks are flying and you know the
garages<00:04:22.130> then<00:04:22.670> it's<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.970> work<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.900> know

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
garages then it's a work like you know

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.300 
garages then it's a work like you know
all<00:04:23.990> we<00:04:24.200> basically<00:04:24.410> have<00:04:24.590> time<00:04:24.770> for<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.250> a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
all we basically have time for is just a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.830 
all we basically have time for is just a
quick<00:04:25.400> button<00:04:25.730> mash<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.210> let's<00:04:26.450> see<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.750> know

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
quick button mash so let's see you know

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.690 
quick button mash so let's see you know
how<00:04:26.990> many<00:04:27.410> times<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.770> person<00:04:27.890> could<00:04:28.160> be<00:04:28.280> and

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
how many times a person could be and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:36.760 
how many times a person could be and
then<00:04:28.880> whoever<00:04:29.570> wins<00:04:29.690> wins<00:04:32.980> one<00:04:33.980> word<00:04:34.370> blood<00:04:35.770> is

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
then whoever wins wins one word blood is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.980 
then whoever wins wins one word blood is
a<00:04:36.830> bigger<00:04:37.130> game<00:04:37.430> it's<00:04:37.940> just<00:04:38.270> bigger<00:04:38.600> scope

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
a bigger game it's just bigger scope

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.890 
a bigger game it's just bigger scope
larger<00:04:39.590> creatures<00:04:40.040> more<00:04:40.340> epic<00:04:40.640> scale<00:04:40.940> etc<00:04:41.510> and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
larger creatures more epic scale etc and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.270 
larger creatures more epic scale etc and
we<00:04:41.960> want<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.230> make<00:04:42.350> sure<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.070> player

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
we want to make sure that the player

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.070 
we want to make sure that the player
still<00:04:43.580> feels<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:43.910> what<00:04:44.180> he's<00:04:44.300> doing<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:44.960> his

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
still feels like what he's doing in his

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.470 
still feels like what he's doing in his
universe<00:04:45.470> matters<00:04:45.950> nothing<00:04:46.550> says<00:04:46.790> I'm<00:04:47.240> doing

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
universe matters nothing says I'm doing

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.210 
universe matters nothing says I'm doing
damage<00:04:47.780> more<00:04:48.169> than<00:04:48.410> just<00:04:48.770> seeing<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:49.010> blood

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
damage more than just seeing a blood

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.980 
damage more than just seeing a blood
effective<00:04:49.580> him<00:04:49.700> off<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:49.880> them<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.810> we've

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
effective him off of them and so we've

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.570 
effective him off of them and so we've
been<00:04:51.110> doing<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.380> even<00:04:51.860> our<00:04:51.950> bigger<00:04:52.190> features

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
been doing that even our bigger features

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.090 
been doing that even our bigger features
we<00:04:52.730> actually<00:04:53.060> had<00:04:53.320> Gore<00:04:54.320> skeleton<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:54.919> that

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
we actually had Gore skeleton so that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.470 
we actually had Gore skeleton so that
when<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.400> can<00:04:55.550> shoot<00:04:55.820> them<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.090> can<00:04:56.210> actually

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
when you can shoot them you can actually

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.310 
when you can shoot them you can actually
have<00:04:56.630> things<00:04:56.840> fall<00:04:57.080> off<00:04:57.290> of<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:59.200> mean<00:05:00.200> you

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
have things fall off of that I mean you

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.580 
have things fall off of that I mean you
