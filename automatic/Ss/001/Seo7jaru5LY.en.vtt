00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this new setup for piano tutorials it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920 
this new setup for piano tutorials it
it's<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.789> little<00:00:18.000> bit<00:00:18.090> easier<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> set<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.810> so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
time okay pretty simple but it's easy to

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
time okay pretty simple but it's easy to
integrate<00:00:45.149> into<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.719> play<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.010> all

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
let's look at the fingerings of what I'm

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.360 
let's look at the fingerings of what I'm
doing<00:00:48.840> here

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
doing here

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.680 
doing here

starting out with my pinky or my fifth

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.950 
starting out with my pinky or my fifth
finger<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> go<00:00:52.920> 5<00:00:53.309> 4<00:00:53.850> 5<00:00:54.469> 2<00:00:55.469> 1<00:00:56.340> 2<00:00:56.969> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
5 4 5 2 1 2 all right now let's look at

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.630 
5 4 5 2 1 2 all right now let's look at
where<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.049> within<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.979> scale<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.549> we

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
where we are within the scale when we

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
where we are within the scale when we
play<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> key<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.260> C<00:01:07.530> major<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
play that I'm in the key of C major so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
play that I'm in the key of C major so
all<00:01:08.280> Naturals<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.299> white<00:01:09.659> keys<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.710> we

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
all Naturals are all white keys if we

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.120 
all Naturals are all white keys if we
give<00:01:11.040> each<00:01:11.310> note<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.790> number<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.710> I've<00:01:13.710> done<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
give each note a number as I've done in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.940 
give each note a number as I've done in
several<00:01:14.490> videos<00:01:14.760> we'll<00:01:15.270> end<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.780> 1<00:01:16.049> 2<00:01:16.290> 3<00:01:16.590> 4

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
several videos we'll end up with 1 2 3 4

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.240 
several videos we'll end up with 1 2 3 4
5<00:01:17.280> 6<00:01:17.729> 7<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.470> top<00:01:19.680> note<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
5 6 7 and then the top note is just to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.740 
5 6 7 and then the top note is just to
repeat<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> bottom<00:01:21.119> note<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.479> we're<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
repeat the bottom note so we're going to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.920 
repeat the bottom note so we're going to
call<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.350> awesome<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> set

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
call that one awesome so with that set

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.740 
call that one awesome so with that set
of<00:01:25.020> numbers<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:26.210> one<00:01:27.210> seven

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
of numbers we're going to have one seven

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.660 
of numbers we're going to have one seven
one<00:01:28.340> five<00:01:29.340> four<00:01:29.909> three<00:01:30.409> one<00:01:31.409> seven<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.250> five

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
one five four three one seven one five

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.719 
one five four three one seven one five
four<00:01:33.240> three<00:01:33.740> okay<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.310> reason<00:01:35.579> why<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
four three okay and the reason why I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
four three okay and the reason why I
like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
like to think of that is because it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
like to think of that is because it
makes<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> easier<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> transfer<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.450> transpose

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
makes it easier to transfer or transpose

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.039 
makes it easier to transfer or transpose
into<00:01:41.100> different<00:01:41.520> keys<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.420> example<00:01:42.869> let's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
into different keys for example let's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.010 
into different keys for example let's
say<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> key<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.920> E<00:01:44.189> major<00:01:44.869> where<00:01:45.869> we

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
say we're in the key of E major where we

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.040 
say we're in the key of E major where we
have<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> scale<00:01:46.560> 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1<00:01:48.770> we<00:01:49.770> have

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.600 

okay<00:01:54.050> let's<00:01:54.350> do<00:01:54.560> one<00:01:54.590> more<00:01:55.010> key<00:01:55.220> let's<00:01:55.400> try<00:01:55.580> a

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
okay let's do one more key let's try a

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.050 
okay let's do one more key let's try a
flat<00:01:56.120> where<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:56.450> have<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.750> scale<00:01:57.970> we're<00:01:58.970> going

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
flat where we have the scale we're going

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.140 
flat where we have the scale we're going
to<00:01:59.120> do

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.850 

okay<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.320> lay<00:02:04.470> down<00:02:04.650> with<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
okay and that one lay down with the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.960 
okay and that one lay down with the

played a different fingering I went 5 4

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.740 
played a different fingering I went 5 4
3<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:08.790> just<00:02:08.940> stretch<00:02:09.180> a<00:02:09.210> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.600> and

natural more comfortable there so you

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.610 
natural more comfortable there so you
can<00:02:14.580> definitely<00:02:14.700> adapt<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> fingerings<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
can definitely adapt the fingerings to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.280 
can definitely adapt the fingerings to
whatever<00:02:16.770> feels<00:02:17.160> more<00:02:17.400> comfortable<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.450> with

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that in mind let's look at when this

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.240 
that in mind let's look at when this
riff<00:02:23.580> works<00:02:24.380> we're<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> land<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
about a different set of numbers the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.970 
about a different set of numbers the
chords<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.330> build<00:02:45.660> off<00:02:45.840> each<00:02:45.980> scale

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
chords you can build off each scale

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.949 
chords you can build off each scale
notes<00:02:47.220> we've<00:02:47.430> got<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> 1<00:02:47.970> chord<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> 2<00:02:48.510> chord

the 3 chord and so on so since it lands

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.949

on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> 3rd<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.100> third<00:02:53.910> being<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.240> part<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
on the 3rd the third being a part of the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the 1 chord of the key it works well

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.010 
the 1 chord of the key it works well
with<00:02:57.690> it<00:03:00.410> ok<00:03:01.440> um<00:03:02.220> not<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.700> well<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.660> 2nd

chord

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.740 

okay<00:03:09.430> very<00:03:10.430> colorful<00:03:10.940> doesn't<00:03:11.300> do<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.420> lot<00:03:11.600> for

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
okay very colorful doesn't do a lot for

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.190 
okay very colorful doesn't do a lot for
me<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.530> context<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:14.750> don't<00:03:14.900> play<00:03:15.020> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
me in that context we don't play the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.680 
me in that context we don't play the
third<00:03:16.060> chord<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.120> lot<00:03:19.180> okay<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.330> could<00:03:20.480> work

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
third chord a lot okay it could work

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.740 
third chord a lot okay it could work
there<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.740> actually<00:03:22.069> really<00:03:22.459> like<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:23.090> ending

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
there I actually really like this ending

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.800 
there I actually really like this ending
on<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.380> 4<00:03:24.620> chord<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.790> gives<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.239> kind<00:03:29.780> of

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
on the 4 chord it gives it that kind of

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.190 
on the 4 chord it gives it that kind of
major<00:03:30.050> 7th<00:03:30.739> quality<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:32.660> doesn't<00:03:32.870> work<00:03:33.050> as

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
major 7th quality it doesn't work as

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
major 7th quality it doesn't work as
well<00:03:33.230> with<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.560> fifth

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.520 

okay<00:03:36.790> because<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:37.900> not<00:03:37.960> really<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> part<00:03:38.440> of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
okay because it's not really a part of

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.070 
okay because it's not really a part of
that<00:03:38.650> cord<00:03:39.450> definitely<00:03:40.450> works<00:03:40.570> well<00:03:40.750> going<00:03:40.990> to

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
that cord definitely works well going to

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.180 
that cord definitely works well going to
the<00:03:41.200> six<00:03:41.440> chord<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:42.960> can<00:03:43.960> a<00:03:44.110> minor<00:03:44.380> okay

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
the six chord I can a minor okay

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.390 
the six chord I can a minor okay
so<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:45.790> listen<00:03:46.120> use<00:03:46.300> your<00:03:46.450> ears<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.400> it'll

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
so just listen use your ears and it'll

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.770 
so just listen use your ears and it'll
start<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.640> make<00:03:48.820> sense<00:03:49.000> where<00:03:49.330> this<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.630> going

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
start to make sense where this is going

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.630 
start to make sense where this is going
to<00:03:49.840> work<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.200> when<00:03:50.410> it's<00:03:50.590> not<00:03:50.950> okay

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
to work and when it's not okay

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.540 
to work and when it's not okay
now<00:03:52.120> rhythm<00:03:52.570> wise<00:03:53.100> what<00:03:54.100> we're<00:03:54.250> dealing<00:03:54.340> with

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
now rhythm wise what we're dealing with

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.920 
now rhythm wise what we're dealing with
is<00:03:54.880> one<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.900> three<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.650> four<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.490> one<00:03:57.930> right

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
is one and three and four and one right

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.870 
is one and three and four and one right
now<00:03:59.440> some<00:03:59.710> different<00:04:00.070> things<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.580> do<00:04:00.760> to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
now some different things we can do to

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.090 
now some different things we can do to
vary<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.480> rhythmically<00:04:02.230> for<00:04:02.710> example<00:04:03.010> we

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
vary this rhythmically for example we

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.140 
vary this rhythmically for example we
could<00:04:03.190> leave<00:04:03.460> off<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:04.120> first<00:04:04.360> note<00:04:05.880> three<00:04:06.880> and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
could leave off the first note three and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.699 
could leave off the first note three and
four<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:07.900> one

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
four and one

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.100 
four and one
okay<00:04:09.610> we<00:04:09.820> can<00:04:09.940> leave<00:04:10.030> off<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.360> first<00:04:10.750> two

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
okay we can leave off the first two

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.770 
okay we can leave off the first two
notes<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:13.150> four<00:04:14.430> okay<00:04:15.430> we<00:04:16.299> could<00:04:16.390> leave<00:04:16.600> off

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
notes and four okay we could leave off

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.479 
notes and four okay we could leave off
all<00:04:17.049> those<00:04:17.260> first<00:04:17.530> three<00:04:17.739> notes<00:04:17.859> together<00:04:18.130> and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
all those first three notes together and

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.610 
all those first three notes together and
just<00:04:18.609> end<00:04:18.790> with<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:21.750> okay<00:04:22.750> very<00:04:22.990> simple<00:04:23.080> there

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
just end with the okay very simple there

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.740 
just end with the okay very simple there
um<00:04:24.550> we<00:04:25.240> could<00:04:25.480> hold<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.530> first<00:04:26.770> note<00:04:27.010> longer

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.659 

okay<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:32.290> could<00:04:32.470> shift<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.919> whole<00:04:33.100> rhythm<00:04:33.340> up

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
okay we could shift the whole rhythm up

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.370 
okay we could shift the whole rhythm up
a<00:04:33.790> beat

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.350 

and<00:04:37.920> so<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.160> kind<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.370> preempts<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.060> chord

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
and so it kind of preempts the chord

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.480 
and so it kind of preempts the chord
change<00:04:39.690> which<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.020> kind<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.320> nice

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
change which is kind of nice

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.730 
change which is kind of nice
another<00:04:42.420> couple<00:04:42.660> variations<00:04:43.200> we<00:04:43.350> could<00:04:43.500> play

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
another couple variations we could play

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.350 
another couple variations we could play
it<00:04:43.890> backwards<00:04:45.860> let<00:04:46.860> me<00:04:46.950> think<00:04:47.070> about<00:04:47.190> this

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
sessions are available for free but what

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.709 
sessions are available for free but what
it<00:05:39.860> does<00:05:40.039> is<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.520> kind<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.759> breaks<00:05:41.060> down<00:05:41.389> these

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
it does is it kind of breaks down these

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.659 
it does is it kind of breaks down these
different<00:05:42.080> scale<00:05:42.319> notes<00:05:42.560> into<00:05:43.400> small<00:05:43.639> chunks

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
different scale notes into small chunks

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.730 
different scale notes into small chunks
so<00:05:44.000> you<00:05:44.060> get<00:05:44.270> a<00:05:44.300> feel<00:05:44.629> for<00:05:44.659> how<00:05:44.990> they<00:05:45.169> sound<00:05:45.469> and

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
so you get a feel for how they sound and

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.050 
so you get a feel for how they sound and
their<00:05:45.830> character<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.340> how<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.520> can<00:05:46.729> use<00:05:46.940> them

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
their character and how you can use them

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.179 
their character and how you can use them
and<00:05:47.240> put<00:05:47.419> them<00:05:47.509> together<00:05:47.860> it'll<00:05:48.860> also<00:05:48.979> take

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
and put them together it'll also take

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:50.350 
and put them together it'll also take
you<00:05:49.279> through<00:05:49.430> different<00:05:49.520> keys<00:05:49.939> so<00:05:50.210> you'll

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
you through different keys so you'll

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.769 
you through different keys so you'll
begin<00:05:50.539> to<00:05:50.599> understand<00:05:51.169> how<00:05:51.889> these<00:05:52.219> patterns

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
begin to understand how these patterns

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.330 
begin to understand how these patterns
can<00:05:53.779> be<00:05:53.900> played<00:05:54.139> in<00:05:54.169> different<00:05:54.650> contexts<00:05:55.159> and

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
can be played in different contexts and
