00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.940
 types of lenses according to the shape 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.280
 of face 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.580
 If you wear glasses to see the best thing is that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 be transparent not in tinted because 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 eye contact is one of the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.350
 more powerful tools that facilitates 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 the communication process contact 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.710
 visual creates a connection and an environment 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.560
 of trust the face is our 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.320
 nature label accompany me to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.820
 review the types of face and the lenses 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.820
 that favor each one 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.739
 and the square face is an angular face 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.960
 with a strong jaw line one 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.480
 wide front and a square chin 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.540
 the lenses that favor you are the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.089
 oval aviator and round frames 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.489
 some glasses with accents of color in the 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.809
 center and on top of the frame 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:03.180
 that you should avoid frames in square shape 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 they emphasize the angles of your face 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.840
 the oval face is a face of 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.659
 balanced proportions has three 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.850
 planes that are the same size and you 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.340
 consider the ideal face shape 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.950
 they are practically left 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.530
 any type of frame what they should 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.409
 avoid are frames out of proportion to 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.890
 your face face girl frame boy face 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.890
 large also larger frames 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.000
 and the long face is a face shape 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.280
 Narrow is longer than wide 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 its characteristics are angular with 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.820
 high cheekbones nose and forehead 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.860
 taller high frames suit them 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.320
 to help them create a more 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.840
 Short Sanchez shape with edges 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.869
 accented and decorated to add 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.260
 Width rectangular or square lenses 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.840
 with some thickness and should avoid those 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.040
 frames with narrow edges that without you in 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.040
 the length of the face 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.130
 in round faces your cheeks are 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.280
 you fill your chin is rounded the width 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.070
 and the length are somewhat similar the lenses 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.460
 What are they doing with frames? 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.440
 angular and geometric styles 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.680
 rectangular and horizontal 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.950
 they appear a long and thin face the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.330
 idea is to generate contrast if you have face 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.150
 round then it uses angled lines and 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.970
 rectangular therefore 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.250
 recommendation is to avoid round frames 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.250
 that accentuate the roundness of your face 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.760
 a face of diamond shape has a 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.510
 front and small chin some shapes 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.239
 angular with very sharp cheekbones 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.670
 and the lenses that are going for them are those 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.430
 that have oval shapes to keep 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 balance and should avoid glasses with 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.390
 low insertion 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.019
 the people that have a face in 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.510
 inverted triangle shape have the 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.500
 large flat face in the middle 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.230
 upper and narrow in the chin you read 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.500
 more aviator type lenses are a good 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.900
 choice and should avoid decorated lenses 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.319
 that emphasize the superior amplitude of the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.319
 face 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.540
 the heart shape has a forehead 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.470
 equally wide broad cheekbones and a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.200
 Narrow chin they go well glasses with 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.660
 frames that add width to the part 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.860
 lower face rounded shapes 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.230
 that soften that very broad front and 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.209
 avoid tall and heavy styles that 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.970
 draw attention to the part 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.549
 of your face should also avoid 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.020
 decorated lenses that emphasize 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.200
 amplitude 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.560
 and faces have a big face 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.980
 impact on the formation of impressions and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.700
 therefore in the image we leave in 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.700
 people
