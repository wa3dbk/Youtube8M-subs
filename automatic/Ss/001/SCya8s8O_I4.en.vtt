redemption as well you've been waiting
for<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.390> moment<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.050> long<00:00:28.439> time<00:00:28.640> yes

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
for this moment for a very long time yes

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.630

and down her uncle's a thug

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720 
and down her uncle's a thug
so<00:00:33.570> therefore<00:00:33.809> her<00:00:34.590> level<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.070> trainee<00:00:35.430> would

so therefore her level of trainee would

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.170 
so therefore her level of trainee would
be<00:00:35.910> more<00:00:36.180> animal<00:00:36.720> and<00:00:37.110> volatile<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.670> she's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
be more animal and volatile so she's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.079 
be more animal and volatile so she's
very<00:00:39.600> much<00:00:39.900> like<00:00:40.610> like<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> Molotov<00:00:42.059> cocktail
