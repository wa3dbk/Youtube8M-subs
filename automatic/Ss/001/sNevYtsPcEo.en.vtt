00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:07.100
 aluminum foil has a plethora of 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.559
 uses since it must be something in the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.759
 until you keep something frozen in the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.700
 refrigerator 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.029
 but you already thought like a huge block 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.670
 solid aluminum is transformed into a 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:25.400
 sheet of the thickness of a sheet of 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.679
 Paper manufacturing foil 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.050
 requires the repeated roughing of a block 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.609
 Huge aluminum 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.800
 we start to melt the business of 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.940
 100% pure aluminum in a furnace of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.130
 natural gas 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.200
 these so-called strip records are 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.480
 essential in five-titanium alloys and 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.670
 Civic are needed from three to eight 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.530
 hours to melt 27 thousand kilos of 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.810
 aluminum in this furnace to the 2nd 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.350
 regiment operating 750 degrees 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.350
 centigrade 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.030
 the melting temperature of the aluminum is 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.129
 660 degrees centigrade 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.430
 a portion of the aluminum pouring into this 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.210
 small way to make a sample 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 solidified in seconds 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.110
 the show allows the realization of a 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.900
 test to check the contents of the alloy 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.030
 this vat is used for 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.850
 transfer the furnace aluminum from the 2nd 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.040
 regiment for the drainage station 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.020
 the molten aluminum occurs by a vat 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.990
 located above the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.729
 drainage 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.470
 At this stage companies are filtered 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.470
 in special receptacles 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.060
 the forms are cooled with water to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.200
 accelerate the solidification of aluminum 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.090
 melted 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.550
 businesses are uninformed and we are 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 ready for weighing for those who like 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.440
 immense measured 4.4 meters in length 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.610
 at 1.4 meters wide and 45 centimeters 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.490
 of thickness 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.060
 he weighs an incredible seven thousand and five hundred 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.649
 pounds 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.330
 then it has to be handled by 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.899
 cranes and placed on base 100 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.899
 special 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 this proposed shaving machine removes 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 3 mm thickness of ingote as 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.640
 companies are eliminated to 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.860
 achieve a perfect finish 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.970
 'lists all traces of the liquid 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 used to cool the units 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.860
 providers have to be eliminated 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 begin the many steps in 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.590
 the block of ingote the block of 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.550
 aluminum crushed by 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550
 weighing the candy 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.810
 temperatures in books are between 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.790
 455 540 degrees centigrade 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.410
 business pressure is checked 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.080
 continuously by a technician 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.480
 if it is too high is decreased and the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 then adjust the pressure to the heat 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.440
 is so great that it is the risk of ingot 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.150
 on the milling cylinder to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 avoid it all bathed in a book 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.850
 which is 95% water and five percent water 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.850
 oil 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.000
 starting with a thickness of 45 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.570
 centimeter ingot gets more and more 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.350
 thin with every step and depending on 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.600
 requirements 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.060
 the deal will go from 12 to 16 times 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.950
 by machine 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.790
 the deal is now seven inches 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.340
 thickness 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.340
 he has to reach only half a cent 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.180
 At this moment the business has five 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.730
 centimeters thick on an average 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.740
 little more than nine meters long 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.400
 This system transports the card for 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.400
 stages of learning 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.420
 business is now turned into a 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.700
 thick and thin. 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.560
 sufficient for the winding where it is 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.690
 involved in himself before being 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.790
 told to think about moving in the cold 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:07.060
 where its thickness will still be reduced 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 more aluminum foil was now 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.330
 very thin and runs the risk of being 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.820
 broken by the attention needed to 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.350
 scroll and then cold folded sheet 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.359
 to avoid this fall a final reduction 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.790
 milling and the sheet will have the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.010
 thickness required for the customer is 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.300
 used a coolant to avoid 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.740
 than the gross sheet in the cylinders since 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.320
 the edges of the blade are slightly 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.000
 damaged corrugated knife remove 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.000
 a thin strip of one centimeter 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.360
 finally the goal is cut in the width 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.450
 and an immense ingot 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.750
 blades that measure 12.7 kilometers of 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.750
 length
