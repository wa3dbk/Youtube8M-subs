00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
with couple of sliced efforts and it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.749 
with couple of sliced efforts and it
went<00:01:25.650> off<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> crossbar<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> little

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
went off the crossbar that's a little
bit<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.350> the
