00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
enchanted piercings or something but

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
enchanted piercings or something but
it'll<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.059> something<00:01:00.329> along<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:00.930> lines<00:01:01.079> I'm

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it'll be something along those lines I'm

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.060 
it'll be something along those lines I'm
assuming<00:01:02.870> also<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.049> said<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.409> masteries

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
assuming also they said that masteries

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.600 
assuming also they said that masteries
will<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.610> tiered<00:01:06.060> per<00:01:06.479> class<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.460> let's<00:01:08.460> say

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
will be tiered per class so let's say

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
will be tiered per class so let's say
all<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> Warriors<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> same

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
all of the Warriors will get the same

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
all of the Warriors will get the same
masteries<00:01:11.729> available<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
masteries available to them all the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
masteries available to them all the
clerics<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> same<00:01:14.159> masteries

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
clerics will have the same masteries

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270 
clerics will have the same masteries
available<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> them<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.200> masteries<00:01:16.650> won't<00:01:16.979> be

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
available to them the masteries won't be

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.179 
available to them the masteries won't be
individual<00:01:18.030> /<00:01:18.330> sub<00:01:18.689> spec<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.830> won't<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
individual / sub spec so it won't be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.289 
individual / sub spec so it won't be
different<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.680> warlock<00:01:22.680> vs

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.720 
you'll be able to get raid bosses like
that<00:03:43.080> as<00:03:43.320> little<00:03:43.920> minions<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.489> will<00:03:44.580> follow

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
that as little minions that will follow

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.520 
that as little minions that will follow
you<00:03:45.060> around<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.480> pets<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.410> can

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
you around like pets but you can

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.590 
you around like pets but you can
actually<00:03:46.739> send<00:03:47.070> them<00:03:47.220> out<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.549> tasks<00:03:47.820> for

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
actually send them out and do tasks for

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.470 
actually send them out and do tasks for
you<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.019> what<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.610> think<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.269> was

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
you and what not to so I think that was

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.970 
you and what not to so I think that was
kind<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.720> cool<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.350> pretty<00:03:52.500> much<00:03:52.620> sums

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
kind of cool and that pretty much sums

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.150 
kind of cool and that pretty much sums
up<00:03:53.190> all<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.820> key<00:03:54.030> points<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:55.110> live<00:03:55.830> stream

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
up all the key points of the live stream

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.650 
up all the key points of the live stream
obviously<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.850> watch<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.209> live<00:03:57.360> screen

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
obviously if you watch the live screen

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.300 
obviously if you watch the live screen
stream<00:03:58.019> you'll<00:03:58.440> get<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.650> little<00:03:58.890> bit<00:03:59.130> more

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
stream you'll get a little bit more

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.250 
stream you'll get a little bit more
insight<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.910> more<00:04:00.480> things<00:04:00.750> but<00:04:00.959> like<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.200> said

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
insight to more things but like I said

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.890 
insight to more things but like I said
this<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.680> TL<00:04:02.070> DR<00:04:02.430> version<00:04:02.459> i<00:04:03.030> summed<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.780> up

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
this is the TL DR version i summed it up

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.870 
this is the TL DR version i summed it up
as<00:04:04.110> best<00:04:04.140> as<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.590> could<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.130> cover<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.700> main

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
as best as I could and cover the main

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.400 
as best as I could and cover the main
point<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.390> hopefully<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:06.930> guys<00:04:06.989> enjoyed<00:04:07.380> and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
point so hopefully you guys enjoyed and

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.010
