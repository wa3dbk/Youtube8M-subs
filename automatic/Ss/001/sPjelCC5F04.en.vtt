00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
a bunch of dragons and then you put a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.090 
a bunch of dragons and then you put a
lot<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> side<00:01:21.030> too<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> at<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> same

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
lot from this side too so at the same

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.649 
lot from this side too so at the same
time<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.030> speed<00:01:24.390> right

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
time you have to put your speed right

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.980 
time you have to put your speed right
here<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.830> super<00:01:26.369> fast<00:01:26.689> they<00:01:27.689> start

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
here so they go super fast they start

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.550 
here so they go super fast they start
owning<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> guy<00:01:30.810> set<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
owning as you can see the guy set the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.510 
owning as you can see the guy set the
x-bow<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.930> ground<00:01:33.930> only<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> makes<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.310> very

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
x-bow on ground only so it makes it very

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.330 
x-bow on ground only so it makes it very
easier<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.750> attack<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> same<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
easier to attack at the same time I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
easier to attack at the same time I
start<00:01:38.790> putting<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.119> article<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.079> she

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
start putting my article in here so she

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.200 
start putting my article in here so she
can<00:01:40.350> break<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> walls<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.280> eventually

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
can break the walls and eventually

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.929 
can break the walls and eventually
penetrate<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.229> base<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:44.430> makes<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
penetrate in the base which makes it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.020 
penetrate in the base which makes it
easier<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.899> her<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.610> could<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.670> used<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
easier for her I could have used a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.749 
easier for her I could have used a
different<00:01:48.390> technique<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.200> maybe<00:01:49.759> better

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
different technique with maybe better

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.899 
different technique with maybe better
units<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.770> as<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.369> last<00:01:53.640> time<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
units but as you can see last time I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
units but as you can see last time I
completely<00:01:54.600> failed<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.320> time<00:01:55.530> I'm

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
completely failed but this time I'm

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.490 
completely failed but this time I'm
