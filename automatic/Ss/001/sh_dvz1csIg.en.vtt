 in this video we can talk about the clean interface guitar pro 6 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.179
 all useful tools for creating and issuing score 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 are now available directly in the workspace 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.949
 we will find his tools in six winter factories 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.749
 universe edition 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.570
 universe instruments 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.279
 the universe is made 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.119
 mastering universe 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.130
 universe agreement p the text universe 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.720
 all these tools will not see a direct effect on the score on which we 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.340
 is working 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.740
 universe edition is composed of several categories 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.100
 in the first category we will find the tools that will have a 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 effect on the score overall 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.410
 that's where we'll be able to enter the key 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.300
 armor 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 the signature and ethical 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680
 ethical interpretation 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.940
 but also all the information 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.840
 to the structure of the piece 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.490
 like to repeat 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.530
 The direction 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.569
 or that information useful to readers 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.569
 qantas caper use it when playing certain parts 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.710
 before talking in more detail about these tools it is important to know 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.840
 how court on our score 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.160
 the simplest one to place on a desired haircut 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.380
 and then through your numeric keypad you will enter the number 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.120
 desired milking 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.020
 this one edition will allow us to change the rhythmic value of this 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.460
 note 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.810

 we will also be able to group his note in ash 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.440
 ligier of our coach 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.840
 ourselves hiller two chords 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.050
 it is also in this category that we will be able to alter the notes 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 and also change the tactics the shack notw 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.469

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.520
 contains all the information specific to guitar notation 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.080
 this is where we'll be able to enter all the guitar effects like ebony 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.870
 the vibratos 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.320
 harmonics 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.190
 notice that if you do not remember the function of one of these tools it 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.580
 you simply place your cursor on the desire icon and guitar pro you 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.439
 tell those what you have to do 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.520
 the fourth category of securities having the mission 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.130
 it corresponds to all the tools we have not dealt with in the categories 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.769
 previous 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.150
 that's where we could get information about canaccord used 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.319

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.629
 and global volume automation 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.129
 artist 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.169
 and the panorama information 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.849
 global 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.349
 by track 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.819
 the second line the instrument universe 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.500
 it is in this universe that we will find tools 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.130
 that will allow you to tune the instrument you are working on 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.019
 the first tool we will find 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.219
 not allow us to tune the guitar on the active track 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.639
 that's where you'll be able to choose 1 preset opens tuning 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
 or create your own punishment tuning 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.989
 save it 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.939
 or add the complete hoods 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.369
 or partial 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.109
 once your guitar with the comedies wishes you 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.959
 you have two options 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.539
 the first option 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.519
 and apply the purchase agreement the current track 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.129
 then transposed 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.039
 this option will take into account 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.379
 the tuning you created and the hood you placed 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.799
 and not transpose our track so that the new tablet fire 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.799
 exactly what you wrote 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.069
 the second option is to simply apply the new tuning foot the 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.009
 Hood on the track without taking into account 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.889
 the value of notes 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.449
 note that if you are working on a track that has not been created for a 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.829
 fresh instrument head you will not have access to these tuning options 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:12.069
 the second category corresponds to interpretation options 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.069
 this is where you can choose which style of play is applied to others 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.340
 tracks 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.319
 you can also choose the type of attacked 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.969
 or the duration of each 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.939
 note that these options are available if you are in 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.710
 carcass 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.610
 these options did not work with lunch 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.819
 just like mozilla ropes 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.719
 the port market interpretation tool with a fetish instrument 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.629
 finally 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.580
 instruments universe we will allow you to choose the desired sound 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.669
 the numbers are available will allow you to create arrangements 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.699
 paper quality delays 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.910
 born it should be noted that a work on the effects and necessary so as to 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.090
 to have scores 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.569
 really professional 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.770
 and we will find its effects of time 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.930
 universe 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.599
 that's where we'll be able to create our own 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.289
 with a choice of the amp 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.870
 effects pedals 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.039
 and mastering effects 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.849
 each track can contain up to 80 and different facts 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.430
 we go a little more than the version of the facts in a next video 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.830
 but know that 80 and actions are possible 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.120
 which is very useful in pieces if you want to switch from a guitar are 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.849
 clear 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.849
 a saturated sound without creating a new track 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.970
 the fourth universe the mastering universe in which we will be able to 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.270
 use this dynamic 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.550
 add the reservations 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.960
 settled and that the actions of the manceau 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.419
 changes made in a mastering universe 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.849
 at least affected all tracks in your score 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.319
 agreement universe will allow you to create new agreements in 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.319
 choosing 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.599
 the tonic 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.770
 the desired p'tites agreement 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.509
 element of the agreement 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.009
 finally the word universe allow us to return the words corresponding to 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.369
 notes of our score 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:04.020
 and these words will match the critical value mike notes 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.319
 that you have returned to your table etc 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.280
 that's the sixth winter guitar pro 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.740
 it remains to speak a little bit that the overall view that lies 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.629
 below 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:16.050
 of the score 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.050
 this is where you will be able to select the desired track 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:23.089
 you also have to do some very quick settings like panning 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.330
 volume 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.150
 contributions 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.910
 or even move very quickly in the score in 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.629
 selecting the desired measurement 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.249
 this global view can be enabled or disabled via the menu 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.279
 display 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:39.479
 hide the global view
