00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
we believe technology is that it's very

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.140 
we believe technology is that it's very
best<00:00:07.330> when<00:00:07.960> it's<00:00:08.170> invisible

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
best when it's invisible

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.910

when<00:00:10.719> you're<00:00:10.870> conscious<00:00:11.290> only<00:00:11.410> of<00:00:11.709> what

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
when you're conscious only of what

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.250 
when you're conscious only of what
you're<00:00:12.040> doing<00:00:12.370> not<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.570> device<00:00:13.809> you're<00:00:13.990> doing

you're doing not the device you're doing
it<00:00:14.349> with<00:00:14.530> an<00:00:15.599> iPad<00:00:16.599> is<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:17.259> perfect

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
it with an iPad is the perfect

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.310 
it with an iPad is the perfect
expression<00:00:17.949> of<00:00:18.189> that<00:00:18.550> idea<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.930> just<00:00:20.230> this

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
expression of that idea it's just this

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.560 
expression of that idea it's just this
magical<00:00:20.890> pane<00:00:21.070> of<00:00:21.220> glass<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:22.270> can<00:00:22.450> become

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
magical pane of glass it can become

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.429 
magical pane of glass it can become
anything<00:00:23.020> you<00:00:23.230> want<00:00:23.439> it<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.560> be<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:25.439> that's

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
anything you want it to be and that's

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.800 
anything you want it to be and that's
why<00:00:26.619> so<00:00:26.890> many<00:00:27.039> people<00:00:27.130> in<00:00:27.609> so<00:00:27.699> many<00:00:28.539> different

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
why so many people in so many different

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.259 
why so many people in so many different
places<00:00:29.050> are<00:00:29.619> using<00:00:30.580> it<00:00:30.699> for<00:00:30.939> so<00:00:31.119> many

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
places are using it for so many

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.960 
places are using it for so many
different<00:00:31.449> things<00:00:32.190> it's<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.309> more<00:00:33.489> personal

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
different things it's a more personal

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.820 
different things it's a more personal
experience<00:00:34.449> with<00:00:34.570> technology<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.440> people
