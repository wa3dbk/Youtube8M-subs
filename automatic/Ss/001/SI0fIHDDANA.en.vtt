why change well here's the story

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.570 
why change well here's the story
I<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:07.110> shopping<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> macro<00:01:08.369> lens

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
I was actually shopping for a macro lens

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.260 
I was actually shopping for a macro lens
and<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:10.020> asked<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.530> number<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.700> hybrid

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and I asked a number of the hybrid

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.710 
and I asked a number of the hybrid
heroes<00:01:13.070> what<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.520> use<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
heroes what they would use and I got a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.490 
heroes what they would use and I got a
lot<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> consistent<00:01:16.799> results<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
lot of consistent results and it was a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.310 
lot of consistent results and it was a
lens<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.490> cost<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.320> $600

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
lens that would have cost me about $600

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.620 
lens that would have cost me about $600
so<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.400> wish<00:01:23.580> list<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> number<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so it's on my wish list in a number of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.429 
so it's on my wish list in a number of
places<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.700> then<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.540> hybrid<00:01:28.200> hero

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
places and then one of my hybrid hero

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.510 
places and then one of my hybrid hero
friends<00:01:28.979> said<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.689> use<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.439> LX<00:01:31.740> 7<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
friends said you know I use the LX 7 and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.569 
friends said you know I use the LX 7 and
it's<00:01:32.790> macro<00:01:33.270> capabilities<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
it's macro capabilities are so good that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's macro capabilities are so good that
I<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.110> instead<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.009> macro<00:01:38.340> lens<00:01:38.579> pretty

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I use it instead of a macro lens pretty

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.469 
I use it instead of a macro lens pretty
much<00:01:39.360> every<00:01:39.810> time<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.939> thought<00:01:42.180> well

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
much every time and I thought well

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
much every time and I thought well
that's<00:01:42.720> nice<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> whole<00:01:43.710> camera

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
that's nice but that's a whole camera

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.350 
that's nice but that's a whole camera
it's<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.610> expensive

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it's gonna be expensive

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.679 
it's gonna be expensive
turns<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:47.369> less<00:01:47.759> than<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> cost<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
turns out it's less than the cost of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.969 
turns out it's less than the cost of
that<00:01:48.869> lens<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> let<00:01:50.820> me<00:01:50.970> see<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that lens so let me see here I can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.840 
that lens so let me see here I can
either<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.729> $600<00:01:54.450> lens<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.729> an

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
either have a $600 lens or I can have an

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
either have a $600 lens or I can have an
entire<00:01:57.560> camera<00:01:59.299> that<00:02:00.299> shoots<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.380> lens

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
entire camera that shoots like that lens

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.069 
entire camera that shoots like that lens
but<00:02:02.100> has<00:02:02.369> lots<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.820> other<00:02:03.000> capabilities<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
but has lots of other capabilities and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.410 
but has lots of other capabilities and
is<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:04.950> smaller<00:02:05.219> than<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.610> GF<00:02:05.939> 3<00:02:05.969> in

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
is a little bit smaller than my GF 3 in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.260 
is a little bit smaller than my GF 3 in
terms<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.840> being<00:02:07.049> my<00:02:07.340> always<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.550> me<00:02:08.759> camera

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
terms of being my always with me camera

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.630 
terms of being my always with me camera
it<00:02:10.200> was<00:02:10.319> an<00:02:10.500> easy<00:02:10.800> decision

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it was an easy decision

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.320 
it was an easy decision
so<00:02:12.540> soon<00:02:13.140> I'll<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.650> playing<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.120> got

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so soon I'll be playing with it it's got

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.020 
so soon I'll be playing with it it's got
a<00:02:15.360> Leica<00:02:15.660> lens<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.310> not<00:02:17.700> interchangeable
