00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.190
 today we present a vice of chickpeas 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.610
 this is a recipe of Moroccan origin not 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.680
 It is a simple quick nutritious recipe 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.359
 and clean both for our body 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.359
 as for our kitchen 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.670
 we soak the chickpeas in the night 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 before in warm water we recommend no 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.610
 go to the chickpea pot that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 they are boiled to avoid to the maximum 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.400
 possible the canned wine 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.300
 chickpeas until tender 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.580
 about an hour and a half to two 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.380
 We can also serve them in a 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.989
 pressure cooker and in that case the time 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.760
 of cooking is greatly reduced there 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.620
 remove the coriander leaf that are 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.579
 withered or who have lost part of their 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.350
 beautiful green color 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.260
 we wash the vegetables very well with water 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 cold the leaf of a fertilizer we throw them if 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.219
 they are fresh we use them as a 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.609
 leafy vegetables such as spinach or 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.609
 chard 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.680
 all the vegetables we peel and chop 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.579
 in squares so they have the same 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.579
 size of the chickpeas 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.230
 we leave everything ready to cook 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.870
 we light the fire we add the oil and 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.670
 We offered the turnip on high heat without 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.850
 stirring constantly until lightly browned 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.560
 little bit now add the spice there 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840
 to do it very fast in about 30 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 seconds so it does not burn 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.539
 we lower the fire a little and add the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.539
 saffron cumin paprika 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.380
 and cinnamon 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.380
 we give a few fast laps 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.290
 add the chickpeas potato for the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.510
 cilantro salt and pepper 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 we give a couple of laps so that the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.320
 ingredients are well impregnated so much of the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 taste like the aroma of spices 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.270
 we add the wine broth or chickpea 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.510
 until we cover the stew if we need a 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.340
 little more liquid we add water 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.260
 we put the fire high and cover up 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.330
 let it boil when it starts to boil 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.790
 we lower the fire to the minimum and leave it 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.370
 tranquilito without removing or lifting 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.370
 Cover for about 20 or 25 minutes 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.050
 while you are making the stew 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.910
 we prepare the couscous a measure of 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.430
 semolina by a measure of boiling water 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 We put in a pan a little 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.330
 oil and sautÃ© over medium heat 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.020
 minutes until the grain is impregnated 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.640
 good from fat 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.010
 we add the water the salt 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.400
 a lot of attention because you can jump and 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.400
 burn 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.480
 we turn off and cover them we leave them 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.600
 tranquilito without discomfort about ten 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.600
 minutes 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.850
 after this time we uncovered and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.880
 stir with a fork so that the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.890
 grains separate and remain loose and already 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.980
 We have the food ready to serve and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.980
 eat good and be happy
