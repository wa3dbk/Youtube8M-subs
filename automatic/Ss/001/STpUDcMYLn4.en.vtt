00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
bit for every day now I've started off

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.580 
bit for every day now I've started off
with<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:28.780> reference<00:06:29.200> point

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
with a reference point

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.530

next the first gate you come through

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.650 
next the first gate you come through
just<00:06:31.810> as<00:06:32.770> a<00:06:32.800> faster<00:06:33.280> way<00:06:33.400> to<00:06:33.430> get<00:06:33.790> then<00:06:34.000> just

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
just as a faster way to get then just

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.660 
just as a faster way to get then just
