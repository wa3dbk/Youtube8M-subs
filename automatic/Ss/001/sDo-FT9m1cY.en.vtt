00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.520
 we will work on this opportunity this 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.800
 conchitas hat and that is based 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.540
 this hat five rows of dots 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.860
 integers doing increase let's do 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.279
 approximately 12 to 13 centimeters 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.249
 of conchitas with separated of cadenetas 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 and half points at the end we're going to 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.550
 begin first by working our 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.979
 circumference of the beginning of the cap 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.360
 for that we're going to start with a little arito 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:35.750
 of 4 chains 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.379
 and in that arito we're going to put sixteen 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.559
 whole points 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:47.750
 we started 3 4 chains we closed the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.890
 round and we do 1 2 3 and we put 16 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.520
 points we go in the second 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 3 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.620
 4 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.290
 5 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.660
 7 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.660
 8 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.840
 9 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.000
 eleven 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.540
 12 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.540
 3 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.710
 14 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.560
 fifteen 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.970
 and 16 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:42.120
 ok let's close it in round 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.520
 perfect then now we do 1 2 3 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.310
 chains to replace the first 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.430
 whole point and in the same place we're going to 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.250
 make a whole more 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 in the next point we do the same 2 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.800
 whole 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.460
 in the third we also do two 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.460
 whole 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.189
 and we will continue working doing two 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.060
 whole until finishing this row and 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.970
 have 32 points in total 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.400
 see you at the end of the row 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.470
 we finish our row and now we go 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 to work the next row 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.280
 we also raise 3 chains and we are going to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.400
 make a whole point where he follows and 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.550
 at the next point at the same point 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.819
 let's make another whole point is to say 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.100
 let's do a whole 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:41.290
 and in which follows two integers 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.799
 ok we do a whole 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.540
 and in the following we make two whole 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.390
 so let's continue this whole row 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.140
 of increases we'll see you in a little while 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.900
 finish the row 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.730
 ok finished this row we are going to do 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.880
 the next one also increases 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.910
 then we raise 3 chains we weave 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.700
 one whole point in the next and in the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.770
 The following will work two points 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:12.970
 integers in the same is an increase 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.850
 let's do 12 points and in which 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.060
 continue let's make 2 points in it 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.400
 what is the increase ok let's work 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.830
 same the row that follows but instead of 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.740
 that are 2 loose points are going to be 3 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.410
 more an increase we'll see when we finish that 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.590
 row the next 3 whole points 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.569
 plus an increase see you in a little while 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.030
 we finish now if all the rows 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.190
 with increases and we have one two three 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.370
 four five rows and approximately 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.349
 about 80 points then from 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 now let's work to work the 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.830
 conchitas and we raise with three chains 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.440
 we make a whole point in it 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.480
 place and we leave it there because remember 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.129
 that when we close we'll do the other 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:05.390
 half ok then we make two chains and 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:07.970
 let's leave one two three four in the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.430
 point number five let's do the 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.020
 next conchita that are two points 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.380
 whole 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.380
 two chains two whole points 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.129
 let's go back to making two chains and 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:29.060
 let's leave 1 2 3 4 and in number 5 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:31.990
 let's do the next 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.990
 conchita 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.970
 we make two whole two chains and two 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.740
 ok and we do two chains again 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.760
 separation and 1 2 3 4 and at number 5 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.740
 I want you to realize 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.210
 the point at which we are 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.770
 doing the conchita is the point 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.480
 next and the rise point ok let's 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.580
 to keep working like this 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.850
 see you when we are going to finish the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.850
 row 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.080
 once we finish our row 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.840
 let's close it then let's do 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.510
 the two whole points that we are missing from 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.460
 the conchita 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.280
 we make a chain and in the first point 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.930
 where we start we make half a point that 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.790
 makes us stay downtown 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.590
 remember that it is always more practical 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.020
 stay at the center 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.930
 then we raise three chains and 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.110
 we make a whole point within the 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.020
 conchita ok we make our two equal 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.880
 strings of separation and let's do 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.640
 two whole points two chains two 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.910
 whole points within our 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.990
 conchita and we are going to repeat this same 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.270
 step and everything we have done up 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.600
 have approximately 18 centimeters 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.660
 between 16 and 18 centimeters long 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.360
 our hat taken from here to 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.060
 the end 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.249
 see you when we are there to do 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.910
 the completion of the hat 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:15.790
 enjoy weaving 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.120
 we are already in the last round of the 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.640
 conchitas in this cap then now 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.160
 what we are going to do is work our 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.409
 last round 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.230
 how are we going to work 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:34.970
 to close his hat we make 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.890
 one and two chains unlike how 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.740
 we usually make a point 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.350
 happened here or a midpoint for 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.900
 stay the center now let's do 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:49.550
 the two chains and we're going to make a medium 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.470
 point to close but we will not do 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.740
 no additional chain to lift 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.770
 we will continue working means points 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.810
 the whole round where the two are 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.780
 strings of separation between conchita and 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.930
 Conchitas are two half points a half 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.690
 point on each 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:11.050
 whole point and in the center the conchita 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:14.820
 we only make a half point we do 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:18.990
 equal half point on each integer 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:21.930
 and in the chain we do 1 and two means 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.570
 points in the separation chains 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.700
 enter with txiki conchita and in the 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.490
 Conchitas we work a half point 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.640
 on each whole a half point the 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.680
 center and a half point on each 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.650
 whole 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.620
 well let's work for three 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:43.160
 rows we are going to repeat this during 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:47.200
 three rows so that our cry 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:52.270
 stay with this edge 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.850
 ok and we close in round hope you 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:59.220
 It has been very easy to work this 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.220
 hat enjoy knitting
