00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
this but we're gonna do a comparison

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.330 
this but we're gonna do a comparison
between<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> let<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.309> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
between the two and let you know what I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
between the two and let you know what I
think<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> end<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.809> ones<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
think at the end and which ones you to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.369 
think at the end and which ones you to
get<00:00:34.350> let's<00:00:34.980> check<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:41.960> okay<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.230> is

about two amps out of this and it'll be

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
about two amps out of this and it'll be
basically<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.860> fast<00:01:29.100> charger<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.579> any<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> your

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
basically a fast charger for any of your

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.810 
basically a fast charger for any of your
tablets<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.479> market<00:01:30.829> once<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.950> fold<00:01:32.189> this

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.249 

at<00:01:35.820> about<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.060> pound<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> weight<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
at about a pound with a weight it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.600 
at about a pound with a weight it
actually<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.619> pretty<00:01:37.740> nice<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
actually is pretty nice and it's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
actually is pretty nice and it's
actually<00:01:38.970> pretty<00:01:39.090> thin<00:01:39.180> you're<00:01:39.540> able<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> put

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
actually pretty thin you're able to put

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600 
actually pretty thin you're able to put
it<00:01:40.020> almost<00:01:40.170> anywhere<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> regular<00:01:41.369> sized

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it almost anywhere that a regular sized

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
it almost anywhere that a regular sized
medium<00:01:42.509> size<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.930> notebook<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.439> actually

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
medium size that notebook would actually

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
medium size that notebook would actually
fit<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.130> backpack<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
fit in your backpack so this is the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.300

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
Apollo - I'm just gonna go quick with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
Apollo - I'm just gonna go quick with
the<00:01:47.430> hardware<00:01:47.970> spec<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.360> far<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.810> we

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the hardware spec as far as what do we

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
the hardware spec as far as what do we
get<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> 10,000<00:01:50.310> milliamp<00:01:50.579> power<00:01:50.880> bank

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
get it's the 10,000 milliamp power bank

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.850 
get it's the 10,000 milliamp power bank
it<00:01:51.570> has<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> solar<00:01:52.049> panel<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.680> top

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
it has a solar panel that's on top

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.560 
it has a solar panel that's on top
that's<00:01:53.189> ready<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> generate<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.270> actually

that's ready to generate to actually

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.740 
that's ready to generate to actually
charge<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:55.110> five<00:01:55.799> volts<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.340> 200<00:01:56.939> milliamps<00:01:57.329> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
charge at five volts at 200 milliamps so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
charge at five volts at 200 milliamps so
of<00:01:58.079> course<00:01:58.259> much<00:01:58.560> less<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.100> we've<00:01:59.250> seen

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
of course much less than what we've seen

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.010 
of course much less than what we've seen
on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> power<00:01:59.790> solar<00:02:00.090> panel<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.630> has<00:02:00.659> at

use right there so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:39.030> outside<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.570> I'll<00:02:39.660> show<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.870> guys

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
and go outside and I'll show you guys

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.720 
and go outside and I'll show you guys
how<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.350> actual<00:02:40.650> solar<00:02:40.920> panel<00:02:41.250> works<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.580> this

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
how the actual solar panel works on this

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
how the actual solar panel works on this
now<00:02:42.240> I'm<00:02:42.330> not<00:02:42.510> sure<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.810> guys<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:42.990> see

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
now I'm not sure if you guys can see

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.260 
now I'm not sure if you guys can see
this<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:43.890> gonna<00:02:44.040> try<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.310> maybe<00:02:44.490> shadow

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this that I'm gonna try to maybe shadow

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.570 
this that I'm gonna try to maybe shadow
it<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:45.810> right<00:02:45.990> here<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:46.590> focusing

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
it but right here in the little focusing

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.280 
it but right here in the little focusing
but<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.150> actually<00:02:48.390> directly<00:02:48.660> charging<00:02:49.140> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
but it's actually directly charging and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.840 
but it's actually directly charging and
you<00:02:49.350> see<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> blue<00:02:49.800> indicator<00:02:50.220> light<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.670> goes

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
you see a blue indicator light that goes

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.000 
you see a blue indicator light that goes
from<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.300> left<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.900> main<00:02:52.590> benefit<00:02:52.980> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
from right to left the main benefit of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.560 
from right to left the main benefit of
this<00:02:53.190> obviously<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> 10,000

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
this obviously is that it is a 10,000

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.820 
this obviously is that it is a 10,000
milliamp<00:02:54.780> power<00:02:54.990> bank<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.500> use<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
milliamp power bank you can use at a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.560 
milliamp power bank you can use at a
later<00:02:55.980> time<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.790> do<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.210> luxury<00:02:57.330> of

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
later time you do have the luxury of

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.060 
later time you do have the luxury of
being<00:02:57.630> able<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.990> basically<00:02:58.200> try<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> top<00:02:58.920> it

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
being able to basically try to top it

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.410 
being able to basically try to top it
off<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.490> Sun<00:02:59.730> okay<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.360> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
off with the Sun okay so for this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.510 
off with the Sun okay so for this
example<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.960> took<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.260> 14<00:03:01.620> watt<00:03:01.920> power<00:03:02.190> solar

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
example I took the 14 watt power solar

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.100 
example I took the 14 watt power solar

device hopefully about three and a half
four<00:03:38.520> hours<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.660> current<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.050> we<00:03:40.170> get

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
four hours so the current that we get

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.530 
four hours so the current that we get
directly<00:03:40.680> from<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.980> solar<00:03:41.430> panel<00:03:41.580> is<00:03:42.000> really

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
directly from this solar panel is really

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.440 
directly from this solar panel is really
really<00:03:42.989> with<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.860> compare<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.550> actually<00:03:44.970> some

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
really with the compare to actually some

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.000 
really with the compare to actually some
of<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.600> fast<00:03:45.810> paced<00:03:46.050> charges<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.650> market

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
of the fast paced charges on the market

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.890 
of the fast paced charges on the market
definitely<00:03:47.760> works<00:03:47.940> very<00:03:48.150> well<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.720> main

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
definitely works very well and the main

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.140 
definitely works very well and the main
caveat<00:03:49.440> though<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:50.310> more<00:03:50.489> Sun<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.730> give<00:03:51.000> it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
caveat though is the more Sun I give it

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940 
caveat though is the more Sun I give it
the<00:03:51.450> more<00:03:51.660> battery<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.290> gives<00:03:52.440> me<00:03:52.620> better<00:03:52.739> and

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
the more battery it gives me better and

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.920 
the more battery it gives me better and
if<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.250> shoot<00:03:53.910> some<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.270> Sun<00:03:54.480> or<00:03:54.600> if<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:54.810> in

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
if I shoot some of the Sun or if it's in

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.900 
if I shoot some of the Sun or if it's in
direct<00:03:55.200> Sun<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.860> fluctuates<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:56.670> shows<00:03:56.880> a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
direct Sun it fluctuates and it shows a

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.550 
direct Sun it fluctuates and it shows a
meter<00:03:57.330> here<00:03:57.570> overall<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.170> you'll<00:03:58.260> be<00:03:58.320> able<00:03:58.410> to

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
meter here overall and you'll be able to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.930 
meter here overall and you'll be able to
see<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.160> had<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> couple<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.640> days<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.850> be

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940

any situation outside of the Sun this
becomes<00:04:25.680> useless<00:04:26.039> but

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
becomes useless but

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.910 
becomes useless but
an<00:04:27.000> emergency<00:04:27.570> situation<00:04:27.740> definitely<00:04:28.740> worth

an emergency situation definitely worth

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.390 
where it doesn't really shine is
essentially<00:04:43.440> as<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.680> addition<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> solar

such a small solar panel on the top that

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
it doesn't have enough energy to charge

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.070 
it doesn't have enough energy to charge
it<00:04:50.340> entirely<00:04:50.670> in<00:04:50.880> an<00:04:50.970> entire<00:04:51.270> day<00:04:51.450> if<00:04:51.690> you

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
it entirely in an entire day if you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.020 
it entirely in an entire day if you
leave<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.650> Sun<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.040> did<00:04:53.670> this<00:04:53.820> where<00:04:54.000> I

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
leave it in the Sun I did this where I

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.240 
leave it in the Sun I did this where I
left<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.360> in<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.510> Sun<00:04:54.690> an<00:04:54.870> entire<00:04:55.200> day<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.770> yes

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
left it in the Sun an entire day and yes

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.160 
left it in the Sun an entire day and yes
there<00:04:56.460> was<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.580> cloudy<00:04:57.120> day<00:04:57.240> moving<00:04:57.660> back<00:04:58.020> and

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
there was a cloudy day moving back and

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.140 
there was a cloudy day moving back and
forth<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.430> main<00:04:59.580> thing<00:04:59.850> is<00:04:59.970> it's

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
forth but the main thing is it's

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.180 
forth but the main thing is it's
blinking<00:05:00.600> on<00:05:00.720> one<00:05:01.140> LED<00:05:01.530> which<00:05:01.800> means<00:05:02.040> it's

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
blinking on one LED which means it's

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.040 
blinking on one LED which means it's
empty<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.700> I<00:05:03.090> left<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.420> in<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.600> Sun<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:03.960> at

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
empty and I left it in the Sun and at

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.180 
empty and I left it in the Sun and at
the<00:05:04.140> end<00:05:04.260> of<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.440> day<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.680> was<00:05:04.770> still<00:05:05.010> blinking

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
the end of the day it was still blinking

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.710 
the end of the day it was still blinking
it<00:05:05.550> didn't<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.820> enough<00:05:05.850> charge<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.360> actually

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
it didn't have enough charge to actually

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.570 
it didn't have enough charge to actually
charge<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.350> as<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.650> final<00:05:08.070> thought<00:05:08.220> I<00:05:08.430> would

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
charge it so as a final thought I would

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.340 
charge it so as a final thought I would
say<00:05:08.730> definitely<00:05:09.240> between<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.600> two<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:10.020> 14

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
say definitely between the two the 14

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.080 
say definitely between the two the 14
watt<00:05:10.590> solar<00:05:11.010> power<00:05:11.280> panel<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.940> winner

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
watt solar power panel is the winner

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.880 
watt solar power panel is the winner
here<00:05:12.390> because<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.140> does<00:05:13.320> provide<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.680> energy

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
here because it does provide the energy

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.890 
here because it does provide the energy
that<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.280> actually<00:05:14.550> promises<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.630> as<00:05:15.720> long<00:05:15.870> as

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
that it actually promises and as long as

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
that it actually promises and as long as
you<00:05:15.990> have<00:05:16.110> enough<00:05:16.260> sunlight<00:05:16.530> you're

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
you have enough sunlight you're

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you have enough sunlight you're
definitely<00:05:17.280> able<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.520> charge<00:05:17.730> up<00:05:17.880> your

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
definitely able to charge up your

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.240 
definitely able to charge up your
devices<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:18.600> this<00:05:19.320> works<00:05:19.590> great<00:05:19.890> as<00:05:20.040> long<00:05:20.160> as

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
devices and this works great as long as

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.650 
devices and this works great as long as
you're<00:05:20.370> using<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.730> as<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:20.910> power<00:05:21.120> bank<00:05:21.390> but<00:05:21.600> I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
you're using this as a power bank but I

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.090 
you're using this as a power bank but I
would<00:05:21.840> not<00:05:21.990> necessarily<00:05:22.110> use<00:05:22.680> this<00:05:22.860> for<00:05:23.040> the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
would not necessarily use this for the

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.890 
would not necessarily use this for the
solar<00:05:23.310> panel<00:05:23.670> built<00:05:23.850> in<00:05:23.970> on<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.240> again
