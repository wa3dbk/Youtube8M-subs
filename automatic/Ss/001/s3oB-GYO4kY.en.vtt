bulky<00:01:50.659> no<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.840> bulky<00:01:52.020> than<00:01:52.729> just<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> regular

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
bulky no more bulky than just a regular

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
bulky no more bulky than just a regular
notebook<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> would<00:01:55.079> probably<00:01:55.590> carry

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
notebook that you would probably carry

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.560 
notebook that you would probably carry
and<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.729> light<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> doesn't<00:01:57.210> add<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and it is very light it doesn't add a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.170 
and it is very light it doesn't add a
whole<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.110> weight<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.560> tablet<00:01:58.979> itself

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
whole lot of weight to the tablet itself

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
whole lot of weight to the tablet itself
so<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.509> definitely<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:01.200> plus<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.189> go

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so that is definitely a plus if we go

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
so that is definitely a plus if we go
ahead<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.820> take<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.090> open<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.810> I'll<00:02:04.320> show

standard<00:04:45.030> sized<00:04:45.240> keyboard<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.930> found<00:04:46.350> that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
standard sized keyboard I found that

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.010 
standard sized keyboard I found that
it's<00:04:46.710> still<00:04:46.950> easy<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.030> type<00:04:48.300> on<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.900> it's

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
it's still easy to type on and it's

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.500 
it's still easy to type on and it's
pretty<00:04:49.320> functional<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:49.890> I'm<00:04:50.670> not<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.000> fastest

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
pretty functional so I'm not the fastest

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.510 
pretty functional so I'm not the fastest
typer<00:04:51.720> ever<00:04:51.900> but<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.770> i<00:04:52.830> said<00:04:52.860> i<00:04:53.040> was<00:04:53.280> able<00:04:53.460> to

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
typer ever but like i said i was able to

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.310 
typer ever but like i said i was able to
type<00:04:53.730> pretty<00:04:54.000> quickly<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:54.390> we'll<00:04:54.690> open<00:04:54.930> up<00:04:55.140> a

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
type pretty quickly so we'll open up a

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.730 
type pretty quickly so we'll open up a
little<00:04:55.770> writer<00:04:56.010> application<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.590> i<00:04:58.850> can<00:04:59.850> just

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
little writer application and i can just

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.040 
little writer application and i can just
kind<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.970> type<00:05:02.970> away<00:05:05.450> so<00:05:06.450> some<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.690> these<00:05:06.810> are

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
kind of type away so some of these are

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.440 
kind of type away so some of these are
placed<00:05:07.350> awkwardly<00:05:07.970> which<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.300> be<00:05:09.330> expected

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
placed awkwardly which is to be expected

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.260 
placed awkwardly which is to be expected
with<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.080> keyboard<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:10.710> small<00:05:11.010> space<00:05:11.700> bar<00:05:12.060> is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
pretty much big enough released it's big

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.190 
pretty much big enough released it's big
enough<00:05:14.910> for<00:05:15.120> me<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.420> hit<00:05:15.540> it<00:05:15.660> without<00:05:15.720> missing
