00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.640
 and return to the confrontation between 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.530
 playstation 4 and xbox one and also what 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.870
 makes the hand of a title that reaches 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.450
 end of this month concretely 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.029
 on the 30th of this month and that is that you already know 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.430
 that that reissue of 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.619
 tomb raider the rebirth of lara croft that 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.610
 we already enjoyed in playstation 3 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.190
 xbox 360 and pc that this time arrives 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.110
 to the consoles nexgen is giving a lot 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.330
 to talk about this definitive tom raider 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.070
 edition and on this occasion it follows 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.050
 talking about the speed of images that 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.079
 will have the game after reports 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.149
 contradictory about his fluency 60 or 30 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.190
 images per second and the comment of 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.920
 the developer itself in which 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.170
 he said there were 30 in the two consoles a 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 new rumor claims that in playstation 4 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.420
 tomb raider final edition will reach 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.420
 at 60 images per second while 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.610
 that in xbox one would be 30 frames per 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.410
 second what we would see attentive to 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.570
 latest information that has been given 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.239
 both can recreate similar effects 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.360
 to the release of pc with 3 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.700
 fx better lighting and much more but 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.040
 he seems sure of his speed sources 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.770
 nearby have detailed the quality of 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.890
 media versions on playstation 4 are 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.530
 60 frames per second in xbox one would be 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.620
 30 according to all that information from 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.979
 media playstation 4 would double to xbox one 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.350
 the 2 render ian to native 1080p and 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.900
 in general with the same effects can 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.120
 have slight differences none has 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.970
 fixed fluency which means that both 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.130
 go up and down a bit xbox one can 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.770
 reach 45 frames per second 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.020
 although it is usually only obtained in 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.840
 empty scenarios for most of the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.800
 game and during the action round the 30 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.619
 frames per second 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.930
 on the other hand playstation 4 will reach 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.210
 60 frames per second as long as 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.149
 possible although it will have slight falls 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.979
 below in certain scenarios from 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.110
 then a lot is speculating about the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.540
 rate of frames per second in this tom 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.090
 raider you what do you expect from the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.280
 next-gen regarding this topic and how 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.020
 you think it's going to be the reality in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.890
 any case next week 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.890
 we will leave doubts
