00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.249 
well I just want to make it to a sweet
16<00:01:37.549> early<00:01:38.149> eight<00:01:38.329> like<00:01:38.539> we<00:01:38.719> still<00:01:38.929> want<00:01:39.079> to<00:01:39.109> win

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.399 
16 early eight like we still want to win
and<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.880> think<00:01:41.420> everybody<00:01:41.779> counted<00:01:42.079> us<00:01:42.170> out<00:01:42.259> my

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
and I think everybody counted us out my

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.260 
and I think everybody counted us out my
sophomore<00:01:42.679> year<00:01:42.889> and<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.459> thought<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.060> know<00:01:44.090> we

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
sophomore year and I thought you know we

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.029 
sophomore year and I thought you know we
should<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:44.479> won<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.689> year<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.289> and<00:01:45.619> last

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
should have won that year and and last

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.539 
should have won that year and and last
year<00:01:46.249> also<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.909> know<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:47.689> um<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.560> know<00:01:48.590> it

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
year also you know but um you know it

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.849 
year also you know but um you know it
just<00:01:49.819> comes<00:01:49.999> down<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.539> being<00:01:51.200> able<00:01:51.349> to<00:01:51.439> buy<00:01:51.619> any

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
just comes down to being able to buy any

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.289 
just comes down to being able to buy any
coach's<00:01:52.130> philosophy<00:01:52.249> and<00:01:52.849> I<00:01:52.880> think<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.179> all

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
coach's philosophy and I think we all

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.419 
coach's philosophy and I think we all
have<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.779> being<00:01:54.229> able<00:01:54.319> to<00:01:54.409> execute<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.189> I

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
have and being able to execute and I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.940 
have and being able to execute and I
think<00:01:55.670> we<00:01:55.789> all<00:01:55.939> can<00:01:56.209> I<00:01:56.479> think<00:01:57.020> sky<00:01:57.259> is<00:01:57.319> kind<00:01:57.799> of

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
think we all can I think sky is kind of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.800 
think we all can I think sky is kind of
she's<00:01:58.310> very<00:01:58.490> very<00:01:58.729> competitive<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.539> she's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
she's very very competitive and she's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.379 
she's very very competitive and she's
very<00:02:00.159> aggressive<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.819> everything<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.209> not

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
very aggressive and everything that not

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.209 
very aggressive and everything that not
hyped<00:02:02.599> everybody<00:02:02.959> up<00:02:03.139> but<00:02:03.409> at<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.859> same<00:02:04.009> time

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
hyped everybody up but at the same time

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.339 
hyped everybody up but at the same time
I<00:02:04.279> think<00:02:04.429> me<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.299> don't<00:02:05.479> really<00:02:05.719> have<00:02:05.959> to<00:02:06.109> say

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
I think me I don't really have to say

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.719 
I think me I don't really have to say
anything<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:06.919> just<00:02:06.950> kind<00:02:07.219> of<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.520> know<00:02:07.609> I'm

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
anything it's just kind of you know I'm

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.520 
anything it's just kind of you know I'm
knock<00:02:07.909> somebody<00:02:08.239> down<00:02:08.299> and<00:02:08.750> not<00:02:09.140> help<00:02:09.319> them<00:02:09.439> up

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
knock somebody down and not help them up

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.289 
knock somebody down and not help them up
and<00:02:09.679> that's<00:02:09.829> kind<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.159> that's<00:02:10.579> my<00:02:10.789> intense

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
and that's kind of that's my intense

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.449 
and that's kind of that's my intense
that's<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:11.930> intense<00:02:12.230> knee<00:02:12.439> right<00:02:12.530> there

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
that's my intense knee right there

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.459 
that's my intense knee right there
so<00:02:13.909> yeah<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.420> think<00:02:14.900> we<00:02:15.049> balance<00:02:15.319> each<00:02:15.349> other

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
so yeah I think we balance each other

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.380 
so yeah I think we balance each other
out<00:02:15.590> though<00:02:15.859> very<00:02:16.159> well<00:02:16.340> because<00:02:16.790> we're<00:02:17.239> both

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
out though very well because we're both

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.849 
out though very well because we're both
very<00:02:17.569> very<00:02:17.840> competitive<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.439> we<00:02:18.500> might<00:02:18.680> knock

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
very very competitive and we might knock

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.559 
very very competitive and we might knock
kids<00:02:19.099> but<00:02:19.310> it's<00:02:19.430> all<00:02:19.549> competitive<00:02:20.030> nature<00:02:20.359> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
kids but it's all competitive nature and

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.809 
kids but it's all competitive nature and
and<00:02:21.049> everybody<00:02:21.409> knows<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.620> I'm<00:02:22.459> gonna<00:02:22.609> try

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
to bring that that grit that grind to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.059
