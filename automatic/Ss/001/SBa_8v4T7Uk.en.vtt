00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.170
 Look, people, all right, today I'm going to show. 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 to you as I do 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 the stickers here 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.860
 I also need materials, I love you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.050
 can pick up a box of milk 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.140
 cut to use as a base can 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.849
 also so much butter margarine 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.310
 a base of any one of you has 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.380
 at home 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.390
 I just do not think it's cool here. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.450
 sybase colorama by having a coverage 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.780
 thinner layer so it does not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 It's cool to do this kind of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.790
 job 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.790
 so come on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.320
 you will apply a base layer 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.149
 the width of a finger 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:11.790
 done that you will do a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.810
 drawing in my case I did a lot of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.230
 People are hesitant when it comes to 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.090
 to apply 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.390
 so come on, you're home. 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.390
 starts pushing 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 knowing he pushed 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:45.630
 she got up when she gets up goes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:49.040
 pulling there being easy easy nÃ© 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.040
 now just apply in the zone 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:14.110
 the excess we can take with the sandpaper 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:17.050
 of fingernail soon done that we will pass 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.470
 coverage in the case to be used is 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.470
 very good 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 and thus our work ends 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.450
 I hope you have enjoyed it until 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.450
