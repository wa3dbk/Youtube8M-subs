here that there's you know it's gonna
want<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.789> stretch<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.269> bit<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.930> sure

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
want to stretch a little bit so be sure

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.710 
want to stretch a little bit so be sure
that<00:00:28.199> you're<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.939> are<00:00:29.970> using<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.539> sewing

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that you're if you are using a sewing

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
that you're if you are using a sewing
machine<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.140> feed<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.619> very<00:00:31.800> carefully<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
machine you feed it very carefully so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
machine you feed it very carefully so
that<00:00:32.759> your<00:00:32.910> tension<00:00:33.360> doesn't<00:00:33.809> pull<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.170> askew

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that your tension doesn't pull in askew

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
that your tension doesn't pull in askew
so<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.360> stretch<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so you can see here if I if I stretch it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.959 
so you can see here if I if I stretch it
if<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.410> really<00:00:37.680> pulling<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.879> would

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
if I was really pulling at it it would

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
if I was really pulling at it it would
end<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.300> pulling<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> shape<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.829> actually

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
end up pulling out of shape and actually

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
end up pulling out of shape and actually
puckering<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.730> same<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.930> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
puckering and same thing if you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.930 
puckering and same thing if you
accidentally<00:00:43.800> stretched<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> width<00:00:44.489> wise<00:00:44.700> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
accidentally stretched it width wise it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
accidentally stretched it width wise it
would<00:00:45.030> end<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.270> puckering<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.559> sure

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
would end up puckering so just be sure

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.580 
would end up puckering so just be sure
that<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.129> feed<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.730> evenly<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.590> this

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
that you feed it very evenly in this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
that you feed it very evenly in this
case<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:50.010> using<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.430> stitch<00:00:50.700> length<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.149> three

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
case I'm using a stitch length of three

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
case I'm using a stitch length of three
millimeters<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.039> pretty<00:00:53.520> appropriate

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
millimeters which is pretty appropriate

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.920 
millimeters which is pretty appropriate
for<00:00:54.360> Muslim<00:00:56.180> but<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.300> course<00:00:57.510> you'll<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
for Muslim but of course you'll want to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.590 
for Muslim but of course you'll want to
maybe<00:00:58.320> test<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:59.100> swatch<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.940> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
maybe test on a little swatch to see you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.380 
maybe test on a little swatch to see you
know<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.840> sure<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.320> stitches<00:01:01.770> are

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
know make sure that your stitches are

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
know make sure that your stitches are
appropriately<00:01:03.390> sized<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.739> say<00:01:04.949> feeding

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
appropriately sized and you say feeding

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.700 
appropriately sized and you say feeding
very<00:01:05.580> slowly

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 

now<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.730> zig<00:01:12.150> zag<00:01:12.180> stitch<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
now you can use a zig zag stitch or you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
now you can use a zig zag stitch or you
can<00:01:13.530> use<00:01:13.620> all<00:01:14.160> sorts<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.550> different<00:01:14.730> kinds<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
can use all sorts of different kinds of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
can use all sorts of different kinds of
stitches<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.290> using<00:01:16.620> a<00:01:16.680> basic

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
stitches but I'm just using a basic

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
stitches but I'm just using a basic
straight<00:01:17.430> stitch<00:01:17.540> because<00:01:18.540> that'll<00:01:18.960> hold<00:01:19.170> up

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
straight stitch because that'll hold up

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.750 
straight stitch because that'll hold up
really<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:22.190> if<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.670> you're

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
really well and if you want if you're

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.670 
really well and if you want if you're
familiar<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.870> technique<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:25.410> can<00:01:25.530> use

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
familiar with the technique you can use

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
familiar with the technique you can use
a<00:01:25.710> French<00:01:26.070> seam<00:01:26.570> especially<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> are

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a French seam especially if you are

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.300 
a French seam especially if you are
aligning<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.350> something<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> stretch

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
aligning with something like a stretch

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.990 
aligning with something like a stretch
satin<00:01:29.990> anything<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> fray<00:01:32.000> but

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
satin anything that's going to fray but

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
satin anything that's going to fray but
Cotton's<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:35.930> heavier<00:01:36.930> woven<00:01:37.500> materials

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
Cotton's and and heavier woven materials

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
Cotton's and and heavier woven materials
like<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.550> tend<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> fray<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
like that they tend not to fray so you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
like that they tend not to fray so you
don't<00:01:39.750> have<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> worry<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.260> that<00:01:46.369> well

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
don't have to worry about that well

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.790 
don't have to worry about that well
there's<00:01:47.580> one<00:01:47.670> sewn<00:01:48.270> seam<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.590> see

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
there's one sewn seam and as you can see

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.100 
there's one sewn seam and as you can see
because<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.670> didn't<00:01:50.910> stretch<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> during<00:01:51.690> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
because I didn't stretch it during the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
because I didn't stretch it during the
sewing<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.710> still<00:01:52.979> retains<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.330> natural

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
sewing it still retains the natural

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.400 
sewing it still retains the natural
stretch<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.410> bias<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> fabric<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> on

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
stretch of the bias of the fabric and on

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.969 
stretch of the bias of the fabric and on
the<00:01:58.530> inside<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.200> actually<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> outside

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the inside this is actually the outside

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.510 
the inside this is actually the outside
it's<00:02:02.580> just<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> nice<00:02:03.200> straight<00:02:04.200> flat<00:02:05.009> simple

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it's just a nice straight flat simple

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.260 
it's just a nice straight flat simple
seam<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> go<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.489> do

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
seam so now I'm just going to go and do

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.710 
seam so now I'm just going to go and do
the<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.450> side<00:02:12.500> exactly<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.830> same<00:02:14.040> way<00:02:17.720> now

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the other side exactly the same way now

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.770 
the other side exactly the same way now
if<00:02:18.840> you're<00:02:19.019> hand<00:02:19.260> sewing<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.910> same<00:02:21.299> sort<00:02:21.690> of

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
if you're hand sewing the same sort of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.300 
if you're hand sewing the same sort of
rules<00:02:21.959> apply<00:02:22.440> where<00:02:22.799> you're<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.130> want

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
rules apply where you're going to want

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.030 
rules apply where you're going to want
to<00:02:23.370> watch<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.790> tension<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.769> especially<00:02:25.769> if

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
to watch your tension and especially if

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.380 
to watch your tension and especially if
you're<00:02:26.160> using<00:02:26.340> something<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> back

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you're using something like a back

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.729 
you're using something like a back
stitch<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:28.019> sure<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.290> don't<00:02:28.440> pull<00:02:28.709> your

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
stitch be sure you don't pull your

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.970 
stitch be sure you don't pull your
stitches<00:02:29.280> too<00:02:29.549> tight<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.410> would<00:02:31.560> say<00:02:31.739> using

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
stitches too tight and I would say using

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.330 
stitches too tight and I would say using
a<00:02:32.190> backstitch<00:02:32.760> or<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.390> some<00:02:33.630> other<00:02:33.810> sort<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
a backstitch or or some other sort of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.229 
a backstitch or or some other sort of
stronger<00:02:35.340> stitch<00:02:35.640> than<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.060> straight

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
stronger stitch than just straight

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.370 
stronger stitch than just straight
sitting<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.750> probably<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.290> good<00:02:37.500> idea

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
sitting is probably a good idea

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.530 
sitting is probably a good idea
in<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> case<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.800> hand<00:02:39.160> sewing<00:02:39.430> because<00:02:40.360> these

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
in the case of hand sewing because these

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.690 
in the case of hand sewing because these
seams<00:02:40.900> are<00:02:41.140> gonna<00:02:41.320> get<00:02:41.560> quite<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.100> lot<00:02:42.670> of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
seams are gonna get quite a lot of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.390 
seams are gonna get quite a lot of
action<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.630> they're<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.710> need<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.130> stretch

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
action so they're gonna need to stretch

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.370 
action so they're gonna need to stretch
around<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.420> really<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> lot<00:02:47.170> of

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
around you and really have a lot of

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.190 
around you and really have a lot of
tension<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.890> them<00:02:48.100> as<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.370> wear<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.670> skirt<00:02:49.200> so

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
tension on them as you wear the skirt so

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.270 
tension on them as you wear the skirt so
you<00:02:50.290> want<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> use<00:02:50.680> something<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.070> isn't

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you want to use something that isn't

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.330 
you want to use something that isn't
gonna<00:02:51.520> shift<00:02:51.880> too<00:02:52.150> much<00:02:52.300> during<00:02:52.570> wearing<00:02:59.340> well

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
gonna shift too much during wearing well

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.420 
gonna shift too much during wearing well
now<00:03:00.520> my<00:03:00.970> side<00:03:01.270> seams<00:03:01.630> are<00:03:01.870> sewn<00:03:02.080> now<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.160> time

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
now my side seams are sewn now it's time

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.870 
now my side seams are sewn now it's time
to<00:03:04.170> iron<00:03:05.170> down<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.830> hems<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.400> prepare<00:03:06.730> those

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
to iron down the hems and prepare those

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.480
