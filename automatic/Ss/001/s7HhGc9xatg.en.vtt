 per hundred as you will see 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 by the way here 7 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 placed folders 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.990

 what I've done is create folders this up to the mind for Korea nice 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.350

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.460
 prize commented

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.580
 create a folder 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.120
 i'm going to put a double to it because 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.370
