 In today's video I came to bring you 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.160
 a suggestion to review a product that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.410
 I tried it I look and love it with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.389
 it the product that I'm using that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.960
 is being clearly underestimated for my 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.720
 hair is the nix iole john is the oil 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
 joão no oil find a caribbean 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.430
 and is mainly the hard line and is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.099
 say so millennially used by 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 many people and is considered an eye 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.140
 miraculous because it is an oil with power 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.670
 of very intense restoration 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 when I was a child, my mother always 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.899
 commented that today's oil was one 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.670
 wonder for the hair but it is an oil 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.579
 hard to find where I'm 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 remember until today I have not tried people 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.860
 when I had the opportunity to see this 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 cream oil of luzon experiencing it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 combined with oil I really stayed 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.050
 so impacted with a result 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.579
 satisfactory restoration of the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.859
 What does it give to the hair? 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.510
 so if you have your hair there 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.810
 resected a lifeless hair without 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.659
 without shine without hydration 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.930
 It is an excellent suggestion that this 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.790
 novex launched today's oil point is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.799
 that according to surveys he has 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 properties very similar to ours. 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.240
 own hair and a natural oil oil 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 vegetables that combine with other 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.710
 assets that also have almost the same 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 makeup with our hair then together 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.689
 useful and pleasant, and he returned the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.270
 hair shine to malleability at 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 flexibility without it with the pole 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.590
 have difficulty dealing with pests 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.689
 then a little bit of strong smell but 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.759
 so people when you apply the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.950
 hair at the time you do not go the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.079

 so this movement that you will see is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.970
 a great combination that I loved too 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.340
 was the very eye today honda Novex 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.680
 usually I'm a bit afraid with 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.220
 those eyes that are so elaborate but 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.770
 This is very good because it looks 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.690
 very similar to vegetable oil and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.360
 it does not get done with that to say 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.560
 so plastic is when we play and 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.020
 do it in the hair 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.720
 very worthwhile is combining the node 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.120
 two products together ok , I hope 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.040
