00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
right there you can program these soft

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.250 
right there you can program these soft
keys<00:03:44.010> by<00:03:44.370> following<00:03:44.819> us<00:03:44.970> similar<00:03:45.750> pattern<00:03:46.079> if

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
keys by following us similar pattern if

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.009 
keys by following us similar pattern if
you<00:03:46.350> go<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.530> tools<00:03:47.630> settings<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
you go to tools settings and

you go to tools settings and
personalization<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.380> before<00:03:52.590> from

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
personalization just like before from

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280 
personalization just like before from
here<00:03:53.579> instead<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:53.940> active<00:03:54.600> standby<00:03:54.840> outs<00:03:55.139> you

here instead of active standby outs you

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.050 
here instead of active standby outs you
get<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.440> short<00:03:55.739> cuts<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.400> here<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.850> take
