00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.800
 they have a password so I do not know 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.769
 worry about that 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.110
 this one if he used the j-2 loader to download 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.110
 let's see if they are online first 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.170
 good live 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.109
 for those who do not know what the fish is for 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.079
 edit and this one can search for information 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:54.199
 this is enough things that fixes the 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.000
 Edith fish is very good, I have it 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.890
 installed and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.350
 that's why I'm going to show you some steps 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.050
 how to install it but I 'm not going to 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.540
 finish installing since I already have it is 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.100
 very good 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.100
 this come here are online 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 so take it out of the official page of 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.159
 fishes 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.100
 so all the credits for him 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.000
 now after they download it 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.730
 come these three files is not so 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 heavy psd 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.420
 we bring them 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.490
 good here is 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.080
 and we installed it 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.950
 now we have it with this is also 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.420
 everything next next here is where 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.010
 the fish is installed this one tells me 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.640
 here 86 because I have a 64 system 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.980
 bits 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
 this but you are going to appear without 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.030
 this 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.030
 if they have a 32-bit system 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.870
 Well, by default it's already there 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.240
 with the following next all 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.920
 next end 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.830
 this is going to be installed where is the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.750
 pro evolution I do not install it that already 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.800
 I have 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.800
 I'm going to show that 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.200
 once they have it installed we are going to 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.200
 go where we install in the pro evolution 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.350
 start my pc 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.260
 and is to register 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.260
 the program and konami 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.319
 good the pcd 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.209
 This good 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.450
 when you have it installed, they're going 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.450
 to open 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.470
 and the first problem is going to appear 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.730
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.989
 when we want 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.989
 open this program 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.520
 the program letter we press 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.990
 here to open the application 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.990
 and nothing happens 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.620
 to solve that close to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.940
 return 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.750
 we click right 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.030
 properties 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.340
 compatibility 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.170
 and execute this program as 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.180
 administrator we apply 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.180
 and the first error has been fixed 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.580
 there is the first part that we have 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.040
 and now this is the second one not what 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.250
 brand but ulises ago has not been 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.250
 installed 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.950
 to solve this I am also going to 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.330
 leave 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.330
 in the description of the video 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.419
 a guide that is that it worked for me and that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.660
 no pcd solution has not been 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.660
 installed 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.590
 well here you read what you are going to say 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.520
 you have to go to the windows registry 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.340
 and put a serial so it can open 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.560
 the application 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.080
 we play 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.370
 we open 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.370
 we wrote the sedyt 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.030
 and accept 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.660
 open the registry and there they have a guide 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.639
 where they have to not be afraid that 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.150
 nothing will happen to them or they will 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.110
 affect wings 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.060
 to the computer they are touching if 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.250
 follow the steps well 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.740
 I already deleted the serial so they can see 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.360
 how it is done as it was read 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.360
 we do exactly what it says 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:53.960
 good here we look for konami 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.960
 konami ipc 2003 that is here 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.100
 good here in code that says do 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:02.680
 click on code that is code 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.870
 double click 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.919
 I purposely delete it so they can see 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.280
 that will work now we copy the 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.280
 serial 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.080
 and we paste it here 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.800
 we paste accept 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:30.140
 and you have to enter the fish 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.140
 with the patch that is the solution 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:38.230
 we open it already opens it as administrator 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:41.000
 what we did in properties and 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.250
 we press and there now well 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.310
 good to me they make me window because what 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:51.009
 I put so that I do not get heavy 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.979
 machine but it opens in mode 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:57.909
 full screen I hope you have them 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:00.610
 served this tutorial I hope that if 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.940
 have any doubt they tell me and I know 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.540
 I will solve 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.540
 with ciao
