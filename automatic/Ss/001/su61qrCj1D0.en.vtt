00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.440
 the book of the apocalypse which writes that the knight freed by the first seal 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.750
 carrying a bow with a crown 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.999
 this gentleman would represent with an anti-christ 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.899
 the false prophets 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.429
 men who try to deceive the world 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.599
 with false pretensions statement 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.999
 he is riding a white horse 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:26.379
 the color that almost means that this case is used just to confuse 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.019
 this represents people with powers of persuasion and war 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 religious leaders authorities 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.450
 dictators who have staged tragic events that our history 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.310
 witnessed 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.530
 massacres and genocide 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.630
 such as the slaughter of six million Jews for example led by the dictator 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.630
 german adolphe team 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.250
 3 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.340
 in recent decades the world has witnessed several false prophets 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.770
 in the late 90's 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.230
 a polished beer 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.860
 developed an obsession with the apocalypse we saw that they 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 invoke him committing murders 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.780
 with a poisonous gas attack on the tokyo metro maktoum twelve people 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 he left thousands injured 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.060
 also in Switzerland another little lithic exit decided that a baby of 3 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.400
 months old was an anti-christ the fanatics then decided to kill him 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.740
 stood for a wooden stake in the child's heart 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440
 before the second report 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 there was a second animal december 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.680
 this the spokesman said 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.500
 who was sitting alone 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.770
 given that it had to take 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.060
 what if they killed each other 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.330
 chosen 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
 a great story 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.860
 represented the second seal 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.209
 as one of the signs of the end times 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.539
 horse color is red 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:18.549
 of blood 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.039
 claimed on the battlefields 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.039
 the book was written almost two thousand years ago 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.699
 the justification is that it seemed more current than ever 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.369
 history has already witnessed 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.369
 millions of deaths from wars 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.789
 world earth 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.599
 20 1 million people died 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.579
 in the second war 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.049
 it was not even bigger 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.049
 53 million reais 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.329
 beyond territorial and religious political disputes 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.329
 there are also urban wars 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.809
 Let's show that we are 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.069
 at least 110 people 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.169
 every day 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.169
 clashes between police and traffickers 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.659
 the last thirty years 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.349
 but definitely Brazilian 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.189
 died of murder 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.189
 All country 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.599
 yet having opened a breast cancer 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.930
 if there were still no 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.719
 and this proves the river 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.029
 in which they appear he was sitting 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 a good deed, right? 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.739
 in reading the apocalypse the third knights represents hunger 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.769
 the black horse to illustrate the darkness 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.389
 they carry a scale that symbolizes the scarcity of food. 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.349
 has a full 21st century hunger is one of the biggest world villains 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.590
 every three and a half seconds a person 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.209
 dies of hunger in the world 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.370
 850 million people do not have to start on the planet 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.629
 to africa and latin america 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.330
 are the most affected continents 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.559
 the most populous countries 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.559
 are the ones who suffer the most 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.819
 at the meeting 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.069
 250 million people do not have to comment 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.360
 so it means that one in four Indians 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.580
 go hungry 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.029
 in Africa the situation is one of constant calamity 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:57.889
 it's like the vicious circle 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.990
 scania aggravates diseases many diseases 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.990
 are caused by the way 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.390
 no more the country team punished by nigeria the earthquake earlier in the year 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 made the situation even more 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.629
 who survived the tragedy now struggles to survive the consequences of 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.550
 undoing 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.550
 the communist hague lack 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.289
 and humanitarian aid from other countries is not enough 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:39.439
 do not have what to eat is a drama also in the northeastern backlands 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:43.629
 about an hour that is already serious 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:50.229
 all year over the same time more than one thousand municipalities of 10 Northeastern states 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.210
 suffer from lack of water 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.210
 a tragedy marked by a date 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.159
 For many 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:03.620
 the hunger of the northeast as in so many other forgotten places of the country is a sign 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:04.960
 of apocalypse 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.289
 good sign 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.529
 before our eyes
