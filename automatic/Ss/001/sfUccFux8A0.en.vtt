being all that impressed last year with
those<00:02:36.079> figures<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.590> mean<00:02:36.739> look<00:02:36.890> at<00:02:36.950> how<00:02:37.189> much

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
those figures I mean look at how much

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.890 
those figures I mean look at how much
detail<00:02:37.579> went<00:02:38.000> into<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.659> see<00:02:38.810> the

little texture there on his hat so let's
see<00:02:44.359> here<00:02:44.629> okay<00:02:44.810> jam<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.530> in<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:47.299> feels<00:02:47.540> like

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
see here okay jam that in it feels like

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.940 
see here okay jam that in it feels like
it's<00:02:47.930> stuck<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.349> place<00:02:49.450> I'm<00:02:50.450> gonna<00:02:51.019> gonna<00:02:51.530> try

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it's stuck in place I'm gonna gonna try

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.789 
it's stuck in place I'm gonna gonna try
and<00:02:52.069> shoot<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.430> my<00:02:52.519> hand<00:02:55.870> nothing<00:02:56.870> all

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
and shoot it in my hand nothing all

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.319 
and shoot it in my hand nothing all
right<00:02:57.889> I<00:02:57.950> guess<00:02:58.129> there's<00:02:58.340> not<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> spring<00:02:59.030> there

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
right I guess there's not a spring there

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.140 
right I guess there's not a spring there
I<00:02:59.359> guess<00:02:59.659> you<00:02:59.810> just<00:02:59.840> kind<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.879> pop<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.060> out

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
I guess you just kind of pop it out

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.289 
I guess you just kind of pop it out
manually<00:03:03.049> just<00:03:03.470> try<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.920> one<00:03:04.099> more<00:03:04.250> time

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.440 

there<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.480> go<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.920> that's<00:03:10.069> kind<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.430> weak<00:03:10.609> it'd

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
there you go if that's kind of weak it'd

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.780 
there you go if that's kind of weak it'd
be<00:03:11.599> nice<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:11.840> there<00:03:12.079> was<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.260> little<00:03:12.519> spring<00:03:13.519> or

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
be nice if there was a little spring or

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.420 
be nice if there was a little spring or
something<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.239> can<00:03:14.359> see<00:03:14.569> it's<00:03:14.750> just

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
something you can see it's just

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.379 
something you can see it's just
straight-up<00:03:16.430> plastic

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
straight-up plastic

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.250 
straight-up plastic
going<00:03:18.290> through<00:03:18.560> there<00:03:19.329> but<00:03:20.329> I<00:03:20.629> think<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.109> looks

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
going through there but I think it looks

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.839 
going through there but I think it looks
pretty<00:03:21.470> cool<00:03:21.650> either<00:03:21.949> way<00:03:22.069> that<00:03:22.340> locks<00:03:22.579> in

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
pretty cool either way that locks in

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.900 
pretty cool either way that locks in
there<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.480> won't<00:03:23.810> fall<00:03:24.109> out<00:03:24.349> you<00:03:24.709> know<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:25.699> can
