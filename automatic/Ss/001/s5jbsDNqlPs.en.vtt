00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
guess what you're referring to is if

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.370 
guess what you're referring to is if
you're<00:00:24.940> if<00:00:25.390> I'm<00:00:25.540> standing<00:00:25.750> in<00:00:26.050> front<00:00:26.170> of<00:00:26.320> a

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
you're if I'm standing in front of a

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.890 
you're if I'm standing in front of a
screen<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:26.860> as<00:00:27.190> I<00:00:27.340> knew<00:00:27.580> what<00:00:28.420> I'm<00:00:28.540> seeing<00:00:28.810> on

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
screen and as I knew what I'm seeing on

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
screen and as I knew what I'm seeing on
the<00:00:28.960> screen<00:00:29.080> is<00:00:29.290> changing<00:00:29.830> and<00:00:30.010> I'm

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the screen is changing and I'm

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.190 
the screen is changing and I'm
discovering<00:00:31.150> things<00:00:31.360> depending<00:00:31.810> on<00:00:31.900> how<00:00:32.050> I'm

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
discovering things depending on how I'm

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.229 
discovering things depending on how I'm
moving<00:00:32.379> there's<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.160> period<00:00:33.550> in<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:33.850> kind<00:00:34.180> of

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
moving there's a period in that kind of

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.520 
moving there's a period in that kind of
experimentation<00:00:34.780> where<00:00:35.110> it's<00:00:35.260> just<00:00:35.410> a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
experimentation where it's just a

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.710 
experimentation where it's just a
novelty<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.430> it's<00:00:36.670> sort<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:36.970> eye<00:00:37.090> candy<00:00:37.600> and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
novelty and it's sort of eye candy and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.360 
novelty and it's sort of eye candy and
it<00:00:37.840> feels<00:00:38.050> like<00:00:38.170> it's<00:00:38.770> very<00:00:39.040> kind<00:00:39.280> of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
it feels like it's very kind of

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.400 
it feels like it's very kind of
immediate<00:00:39.910> in<00:00:40.090> instead<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.450> it's<00:00:41.140> sort<00:00:41.350> of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
immediate in instead of it's sort of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.200 
immediate in instead of it's sort of
slightly<00:00:41.680> gimmicky<00:00:42.280> but<00:00:42.309> I<00:00:42.520> think<00:00:42.730> once<00:00:43.150> you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
slightly gimmicky but I think once you

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.360 
slightly gimmicky but I think once you
move<00:00:43.450> past<00:00:43.720> that<00:00:43.960> phase<00:00:44.200> then<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:44.980> get<00:00:45.160> into

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
move past that phase then you get into

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.790 
move past that phase then you get into
an<00:00:45.430> area<00:00:45.790> where<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.720> starts<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.199> become<00:00:47.350> very

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
an area where it starts to become very

00:00:47.800 --> 00:01:00.520 
an area where it starts to become very
very<00:00:48.100> deep<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.150> complex<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.400> rich

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530

my<00:01:01.130> name's<00:01:01.310> Nick<00:01:01.490> hooker<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:02.000> worked<00:01:02.630> the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
my name's Nick hooker I worked the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.509 
my name's Nick hooker I worked the
French<00:01:02.990> store<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.920> know<00:01:04.040> we<00:01:04.160> traditionally

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
French store you know we traditionally

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.790 
French store you know we traditionally
work<00:01:04.790> on<00:01:05.030> movies<00:01:05.690> like<00:01:05.870> Avatar<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.680> Harry

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
work on movies like Avatar and the Harry

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.550 
work on movies like Avatar and the Harry
Potter<00:01:07.040> movies<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.670> James<00:01:08.570> Bond<00:01:08.870> so<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:09.410> have

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
Potter movies and James Bond so we have

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.770 
Potter movies and James Bond so we have
this<00:01:09.680> kind<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:09.920> very<00:01:10.160> very<00:01:10.490> sort<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.450> visual

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
this kind of very very sort of visual

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.930 
this kind of very very sort of visual
effects<00:01:12.020> powerhouse<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.800> we<00:01:13.550> thought<00:01:13.760> it'd

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
effects powerhouse and we thought it'd

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.430 
effects powerhouse and we thought it'd
be<00:01:13.970> interesting<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.600> see<00:01:14.840> what<00:01:14.990> would<00:01:15.110> happen

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
be interesting to see what would happen

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.080 
be interesting to see what would happen
when<00:01:15.590> he<00:01:15.710> brought<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:15.950> kind<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.640> culture

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
when he brought that kind of culture

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.210 
when he brought that kind of culture
into<00:01:17.930> contact<00:01:18.410> with<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.710> creative<00:01:19.010> coding

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
into contact with the creative coding

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.969 
into contact with the creative coding
culture<00:01:19.700> which<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.030> very<00:01:20.470> experimental<00:01:21.470> and

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
culture which is very experimental and

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.740 
culture which is very experimental and
very<00:01:22.250> kind<00:01:22.550> of<00:01:22.670> fight<00:01:23.119> sort<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.740> vital<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
very kind of fight sort of vital and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.230 
very kind of fight sort of vital and
much<00:01:26.750> less<00:01:27.229> much<00:01:27.619> looser<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.280> think<00:01:28.850> what<00:01:29.000> this

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
much less much looser I think what this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.580 
much less much looser I think what this
vent<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.780> at<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.080> beginning<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.530> that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
vent is at the beginning of that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.859 
vent is at the beginning of that
relationship<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:37.000> think<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.330> was<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> pretty

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
relationship I think it was a pretty

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.389 
relationship I think it was a pretty
immediate<00:01:39.290> but<00:01:39.530> as<00:01:39.740> far<00:01:39.979> as<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.160> could<00:01:40.220> remember

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
immediate but as far as I could remember

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.370 
immediate but as far as I could remember
that<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:40.970> had<00:01:41.149> guys<00:01:41.660> from<00:01:41.899> Google<00:01:42.050> this

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
that we had guys from Google this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.440 
that we had guys from Google this
amazing<00:01:42.800> detection<00:01:43.220> technology<00:01:43.700> we<00:01:43.850> had<00:01:44.030> a

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
amazing detection technology we had a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.080 
amazing detection technology we had a
bunch<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.229> coding<00:01:45.860> 10<00:01:46.310> uses<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:46.880> were

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
bunch of coding 10 uses that were

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.870 
bunch of coding 10 uses that were
effortless<00:01:47.869> with<00:01:48.470> unity<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.369> then<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.550> host<00:01:49.700> of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
effortless with unity and then a host of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.300 
effortless with unity and then a host of
other<00:01:50.259> languages<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.560> mean<00:01:51.740> as<00:01:51.979> soon<00:01:52.160> as

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
other languages I mean as soon as

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.190 
other languages I mean as soon as
everybody<00:01:52.940> but<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.630> cards<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:53.990> table

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
everybody but the cards on the table

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.139 
everybody but the cards on the table
it's<00:01:54.920> quite<00:01:55.220> easy<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.460> be<00:01:55.640> from<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.940> tops

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
it's quite easy to be from the tops

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.990 
it's quite easy to be from the tops
between<00:01:56.509> those<00:01:57.470> things<00:01:58.160> we<00:01:58.610> always<00:01:58.820> always

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
between those things we always always

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.310 
between those things we always always
had<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.390> mind<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.750> we<00:01:59.810> didn't<00:01:59.990> want<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.170> fall

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
had in mind that we didn't want to fall

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.469 
had in mind that we didn't want to fall
into<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.590> trap<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.070> being<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:02.119> game

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
into the trap of it being like a game

feel<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:13.340> intriguing<00:02:13.640> thing<00:02:13.910> about<00:02:13.940> projects

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
feel the intriguing thing about projects

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.060 
feel the intriguing thing about projects
like<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.110> time<00:02:15.440> frame<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
like this is that the time frame is the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.789 
like this is that the time frame is the
thing<00:02:16.250> that's<00:02:16.400> completely<00:02:16.730> alien<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.090> us

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.670 

we<00:02:21.799> were<00:02:21.920> talking<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.489> what<00:02:22.879> our<00:02:23.680> story

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
we were talking about what our story

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.819 
we were talking about what our story
should<00:02:24.829> be<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.409> David<00:02:27.409> who<00:02:27.439> threw<00:02:27.739> out

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
should be and it was David who threw out

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.119 
should be and it was David who threw out
the<00:02:28.069> idea<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:29.319> exploring<00:02:30.319> sinister

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
the idea of a exploring sinister

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.429 
the idea of a exploring sinister
environment<00:02:32.000> full<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.209> spikes<00:02:32.569> we<00:02:33.349> were

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
environment full of spikes we were

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.199 
environment full of spikes we were
thinking<00:02:33.769> about<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:34.129> most<00:02:34.519> primitive<00:02:34.790> ways

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
thinking about the most primitive ways

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.020 
thinking about the most primitive ways
of<00:02:35.390> storytelling<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.409> earliest<00:02:37.129> versions<00:02:37.909> of

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
of storytelling and earliest versions of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.449 
of storytelling and earliest versions of
that<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:38.900> we<00:02:39.439> were<00:02:39.500> using<00:02:39.709> we<00:02:39.920> came<00:02:40.129> here<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
that and we were using we came here to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.940 
that and we were using we came here to
see<00:02:40.609> an<00:02:40.730> actual<00:02:41.090> thing<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.480> use<00:02:41.950> paintings

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
see an actual thing to use paintings

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
see an actual thing to use paintings
with<00:02:43.239> indicated<00:02:44.239> one<00:02:44.359> of<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.510> truly<00:02:44.930> first

storytelling in human existence that
since<00:02:50.329> sound<00:02:50.510> symptomatic<00:02:55.359> so<00:02:56.359> for<00:02:56.690> this

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
since sound symptomatic so for this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.140 
since sound symptomatic so for this
project<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.349> like<00:02:57.769> all<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.159> the<00:02:58.310> teams<00:02:58.790> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the hackathon we were all ended up using

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.410 
the hackathon we were all ended up using
unity<00:03:01.579> which<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.540> most<00:03:02.989> accessible

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
unity which is the most accessible

unity which is the most accessible
high-quality<00:03:05.420> game<00:03:06.049> engine<00:03:06.500> around<00:03:07.099> in<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
high-quality game engine around in the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.059 
high-quality game engine around in the
game<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.359> is<00:03:08.569> a<00:03:08.599> camera<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.739> cameras

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
game it is a camera and the cameras

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.949 
game it is a camera and the cameras
being<00:03:10.280> moved<00:03:10.579> around<00:03:10.819> by<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.329> collaborative

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
being moved around by the collaborative

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.789 
being moved around by the collaborative
action<00:03:12.439> of<00:03:12.620> everybody<00:03:13.129> being<00:03:13.879> tracked<00:03:14.720> by<00:03:15.260> the

Google<00:03:16.659> modified<00:03:17.659> Kinect<00:03:18.049> system<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:19.069> that's

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
Google modified Kinect system so that's

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.910 
Google modified Kinect system so that's
two<00:03:20.030> cameras<00:03:20.540> set<00:03:20.989> up<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.260> calibrator<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.859> a

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
two cameras set up a calibrator of a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.490 
two cameras set up a calibrator of a
floor<00:03:22.189> that<00:03:22.549> can<00:03:23.329> figure<00:03:24.109> out<00:03:24.199> where

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
floor that can figure out where

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.319 
floor that can figure out where
anybody's<00:03:24.859> standing<00:03:25.340> within<00:03:25.519> about<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.910> 10

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
anybody's standing within about a 10

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.559 
anybody's standing within about a 10
square<00:03:26.540> foot<00:03:26.870> block<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.180> collectively<00:03:29.180> all

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
square foot block so collectively all

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.330 
square foot block so collectively all
the<00:03:29.690> people<00:03:29.900> move<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.169> camera<00:03:30.620> but<00:03:31.040> each<00:03:31.310> of

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
the people move the camera but each of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.390 
the people move the camera but each of
them<00:03:31.549> individually<00:03:31.819> are<00:03:32.540> lights<00:03:33.199> so<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.220> can

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
them individually are lights so you can

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.610 
them individually are lights so you can
walk<00:03:34.879> back<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:35.599> forth<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.019> front<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.569 

through<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.870> game<00:03:45.170> engine<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:46.159> a<00:03:46.250> bit<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.459> a

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
through a game engine it's a bit of a

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.000 
through a game engine it's a bit of a
red<00:03:47.450> herring<00:03:47.480> for<00:03:47.780> us<00:03:48.049> it's<00:03:48.409> more<00:03:48.560> about<00:03:48.739> can

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
red herring for us it's more about can

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.309 
red herring for us it's more about can
we<00:03:49.189> get<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.549> certain<00:03:49.849> level<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.209> quality<00:03:50.540> that

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
we get a certain level of quality that

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.860 
we get a certain level of quality that
people<00:03:51.439> might<00:03:51.650> expect<00:03:51.920> in<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> cinema<00:03:53.180> its

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
people might expect in the cinema its

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.539 
people might expect in the cinema its
weekly<00:03:54.140> noise<00:03:54.379> environment<00:03:54.950> it's<00:03:55.099> all<00:03:55.280> about

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
weekly noise environment it's all about

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.390

really a pretty new development in game
engines<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.409> real-time<00:04:12.799> graphics<00:04:13.400> right

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
engines and real-time graphics right

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.259 
engines and real-time graphics right
that<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:15.560> can<00:04:15.769> cast<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.430> shadow<00:04:16.459> not<00:04:16.940> drift

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
that you can cast a shadow not drift

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.800 
that you can cast a shadow not drift
from<00:04:17.419> one<00:04:17.509> light<00:04:17.810> source<00:04:18.109> but<00:04:18.259> from<00:04:18.500> many<00:04:19.810> this

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
from one light source but from many this

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.270 
from one light source but from many this
is<00:04:20.840> an<00:04:21.109> exciting<00:04:21.470> thing<00:04:21.500> about<00:04:21.650> pulling<00:04:22.130> these

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
be able to use the technology that we've

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.320 
be able to use the technology that we've
had<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.080> house<00:04:30.259> for<00:04:30.410> 15<00:04:30.800> years

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.060 

using<00:04:38.330> lots<00:04:38.510> of<00:04:38.630> means<00:04:38.840> it's<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.590> reason<00:04:39.980> for

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
using lots of means it's the reason for

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.250 
using lots of means it's the reason for
being<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.570> Framestore<00:04:41.570> last<00:04:41.810> that's<00:04:42.080> my

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
being a Framestore last that's my

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.540 
being a Framestore last that's my
department<00:04:42.410> that's<00:04:42.830> what<00:04:42.920> we<00:04:43.010> do<00:04:43.190> when<00:04:43.430> we

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
department that's what we do when we

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.280 
department that's what we do when we
throwing<00:04:44.060> ourselves<00:04:44.240> headlong<00:04:44.930> into<00:04:45.110> this

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
throwing ourselves headlong into this

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.780 
throwing ourselves headlong into this
and<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.530> done<00:04:45.740> for<00:04:45.770> years<00:04:46.100> it's<00:04:46.370> blurring

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
and have done for years it's blurring

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.160 
and have done for years it's blurring
that<00:04:46.820> line<00:04:47.120> between<00:04:47.300> what's<00:04:47.720> experiential

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
that line between what's experiential

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.590 
that line between what's experiential
and<00:04:48.620> what's<00:04:48.800> something<00:04:49.610> that's<00:04:49.790> sit<00:04:50.270> back<00:04:50.480> and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
and what's something that's sit back and

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.480 
and what's something that's sit back and
enjoy<00:04:50.660> from<00:04:51.410> our<00:04:51.530> perspective<00:04:52.070> we<00:04:52.100> have<00:04:52.370> to

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
enjoy from our perspective we have to

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.880 
enjoy from our perspective we have to
come<00:04:52.670> to<00:04:52.850> an<00:04:53.210> angle<00:04:53.510> of<00:04:53.630> quality<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:54.650> we<00:04:54.740> need

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
come to an angle of quality so we need

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.010 
come to an angle of quality so we need
to<00:04:55.010> be<00:04:55.100> sure<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.310> anything<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.390> coming

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
to be sure that anything that is coming

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.040 
to be sure that anything that is coming
interactively<00:04:58.120> experiential<00:04:59.120> displays<00:04:59.870> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
interactively experiential displays the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.900 
interactively experiential displays the
same<00:05:00.260> kind<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.590> level<00:05:00.710> of<00:05:00.950> quality<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.820> you'd

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
same kind of level of quality that you'd

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.060 
same kind of level of quality that you'd
expect<00:05:02.300> from<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.450> cinematic<00:05:03.050> experience

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.070 

I<00:05:08.100> kept<00:05:09.030> thinking<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.330> what<00:05:09.480> it<00:05:09.570> would<00:05:09.930> be<00:05:09.990> like

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
I kept thinking of what it would be like

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.830 
I kept thinking of what it would be like
take<00:05:10.890> some<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.160> these<00:05:11.220> ideas<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:11.880> put<00:05:12.540> them<00:05:12.570> in

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
take some of these ideas and put them in

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.390 
take some of these ideas and put them in
Grand<00:05:13.140> Central<00:05:13.440> Station<00:05:13.530> where<00:05:14.040> people<00:05:14.310> are
