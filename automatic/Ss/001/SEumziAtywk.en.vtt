I'm not surprised by the comments but I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.580 
I'm not surprised by the comments but I
think<00:01:11.030> after<00:01:11.150> Avengers<00:01:11.720> 3<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:11.960> think<00:01:12.080> Marvel's

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
think after Avengers 3 I think Marvel's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.190 
think after Avengers 3 I think Marvel's
done<00:01:12.770> with<00:01:12.920> them<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.760> think<00:01:14.300> look<00:01:14.960> they<00:01:15.140> were

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
done with them I think look they were

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.480 
done with them I think look they were
put<00:01:15.440> into<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.680> position<00:01:15.830> where<00:01:16.130> they<00:01:16.250> pay

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
put into a position where they pay

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.640 
put into a position where they pay
Robert<00:01:17.150> Downey<00:01:17.270> jr.<00:01:17.540> far<00:01:17.930> more<00:01:18.200> than<00:01:18.380> they<00:01:18.500> pay

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
Robert Downey jr. far more than they pay

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.750 
Robert Downey jr. far more than they pay
anybody<00:01:18.830> else<00:01:19.100> in<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.400> Marvel<00:01:19.640> Cinematic

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
anybody else in the Marvel Cinematic

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.840 
anybody else in the Marvel Cinematic
Universe<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:21.530> rightfully<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.370> pay<00:01:22.640> him

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
Universe and it rightfully so to pay him

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.370 
Universe and it rightfully so to pay him
more<00:01:23.060> but<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.420> think<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.780> amount<00:01:23.990> of<00:01:24.020> money<00:01:24.200> he

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
more but I think the amount of money he

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.540 
more but I think the amount of money he
actually<00:01:24.680> gets<00:01:24.860> for<00:01:24.980> this<00:01:25.070> franchise<00:01:25.250> is

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
actually gets for this franchise is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.070 
actually gets for this franchise is
unreasonable<00:01:26.270> I've<00:01:26.660> always<00:01:26.900> thought<00:01:27.020> that

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
unreasonable I've always thought that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.230 
unreasonable I've always thought that
even<00:01:27.350> I'm<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.500> huge<00:01:28.010> Robert<00:01:28.370> Downey<00:01:28.520> jr.<00:01:28.820> fan<00:01:29.000> I

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
even I'm a huge Robert Downey jr. fan I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.730 
even I'm a huge Robert Downey jr. fan I
think<00:01:29.570> what<00:01:29.659> they<00:01:29.750> pay<00:01:29.900> was<00:01:30.050> unreasonable<00:01:30.470> and

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
think what they pay was unreasonable and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.330 
think what they pay was unreasonable and
when<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.700> came<00:01:31.880> time<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.860> negotiate<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:34.250> new

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
when it came time to negotiate a new

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.460 
when it came time to negotiate a new
deal<00:01:34.670> with<00:01:34.700> them<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:35.270> think<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.020> very<00:01:36.140> telling

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
deal with them I think it's very telling

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.410

run under situation where Marvel realize

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.780 
run under situation where Marvel realize
we<00:02:13.140> can't<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.620> lose<00:02:13.769> Robert<00:02:14.129> Downey<00:02:14.250> jr.<00:02:14.580> now

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.229 
although I would have been okay with it
even<00:02:16.409> though<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.560> prefer<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.010> him<00:02:17.099> there

coming out of Toronto as well so maybe

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.080 
coming out of Toronto as well so maybe
this<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> mark<00:02:37.409> or<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> negotiating<00:02:38.579> tactic

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this is a mark or a negotiating tactic

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.430 
this is a mark or a negotiating tactic
on<00:02:39.239> Marvel's<00:02:39.750> part<00:02:39.959> where<00:02:40.140> maybe<00:02:40.260> they're

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
on Marvel's part where maybe they're

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.190 
on Marvel's part where maybe they're
sitting<00:02:40.709> back<00:02:40.739> saying<00:02:41.040> okay<00:02:41.760> let<00:02:42.239> let<00:02:42.629> our<00:02:42.750> DJ

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180

see that his other films aren't doing so
well<00:02:45.359> and<00:02:45.569> he's<00:02:45.720> not<00:02:45.900> gonna<00:02:46.019> get<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.349> better

with<00:03:12.450> him<00:03:12.629> on<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.260> type<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.530> level<00:03:13.680> because<00:03:14.159> I

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
with him on that type of level because I

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.309 
with him on that type of level because I
think<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.549> rest<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.629> characters<00:03:15.959> in

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
think the rest of the characters in

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.659 
think the rest of the characters in
there<00:03:16.500> they<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.799> be<00:03:16.829> like<00:03:17.099> okay<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.639> just

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
there they can be like okay we just

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.339 
there they can be like okay we just
recast<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.299> they<00:03:18.389> can<00:03:18.540> do<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> same<00:03:18.780> with<00:03:19.139> him

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
recast and they can do the same with him

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.770 
recast and they can do the same with him
as<00:03:19.560> well<00:03:19.739> but<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.519> bigger<00:03:20.760> hit<00:03:21.060> because

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
as well but it's a bigger hit because

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.509 
as well but it's a bigger hit because
he's<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.230> beloved<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:22.980> role

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
he's so beloved in that role

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.309 
he's so beloved in that role
everyone<00:03:24.000> knows<00:03:24.419> him<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:24.900> kind<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.109> like<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
everyone knows him it's kind of like the

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.289 
everyone knows him it's kind of like the
Hugh<00:03:25.500> Jackman<00:03:25.980> thing<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.370> Wolverine<00:03:26.880> they

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
Hugh Jackman thing and Wolverine they

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.150 
Hugh Jackman thing and Wolverine they
just<00:03:27.480> associate<00:03:28.139> with<00:03:28.379> him<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.980> but

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
just associate with him with that but

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.789 
just associate with him with that but
you're<00:03:30.090> right<00:03:30.299> eventually<00:03:30.569> Marvel<00:03:31.079> will<00:03:31.620> have

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
you're right eventually Marvel will have

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.349 
you're right eventually Marvel will have
to<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.129> like<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.489> line<00:03:32.790> they<00:03:32.940> can't<00:03:33.150> cross

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
to have like a line they can't cross

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.059 
to have like a line they can't cross
they'll<00:03:33.599> be<00:03:33.690> like<00:03:33.810> okay<00:03:33.989> well<00:03:34.319> we<00:03:34.500> can't<00:03:34.829> do

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
they'll be like okay well we can't do

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.240 
they'll be like okay well we can't do
this<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:36.480> think<00:03:36.720> probably<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.859> will<00:03:38.040> be

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
this and I think probably it will be

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.789 
this and I think probably it will be
after<00:03:38.370> Avengers<00:03:38.910> 3<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.180> don't<00:03:39.629> think<00:03:40.169> we're

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
after Avengers 3 I don't think we're

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.339 
after Avengers 3 I don't think we're
gonna<00:03:40.889> see<00:03:41.160> an<00:03:41.250> Iron<00:03:41.430> Man<00:03:41.639> for<00:03:41.910> between<00:03:42.239> 2<00:03:43.109> &amp;<00:03:43.319> 3

gonna see an Iron Man for between 2 &amp; 3

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
of pattern where they're doing this

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.089 
of pattern where they're doing this
sequel<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.840> existing<00:03:49.260> franchiser<00:03:49.680> than<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:49.919> new

sequel to existing franchiser than a new

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.990 
sequel to existing franchiser than a new
one<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.489> year<00:03:50.669> we<00:03:50.760> did<00:03:50.849> Captain

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
one like this year we did Captain

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.330 
one like this year we did Captain
America<00:03:51.359> -<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.169> we<00:03:52.319> had<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> Guardians<00:03:53.099> next

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
America - and we had a Guardians next

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.680 
America - and we had a Guardians next
year<00:03:53.459> we'll<00:03:53.609> have<00:03:53.639> Avengers<00:03:54.150> 2<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.599> we'll

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
year we'll have Avengers 2 and we'll

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.159 
year we'll have Avengers 2 and we'll
have<00:03:54.810> ant-man<00:03:55.109> so<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:56.160> thought<00:03:56.720> exactly<00:03:57.720> Doctor

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
have ant-man so I thought exactly Doctor

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.830 
have ant-man so I thought exactly Doctor
Strange<00:03:58.280> exactly<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.489> think<00:04:00.120> we<00:04:00.629> probably

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
Strange exactly so I think we probably

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.619 
Strange exactly so I think we probably
will<00:04:01.079> skip<00:04:01.440> Iron<00:04:01.709> Man<00:04:01.980> for<00:04:02.280> for<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.669> this<00:04:03.389> next

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
will skip Iron Man for for the this next

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.140 
will skip Iron Man for for the this next
phase<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.139> then<00:04:04.260> go<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.769> then<00:04:04.829> go<00:04:05.010> do<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.519> kind

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
phase and then go and then go do a kind

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.720 
phase and then go and then go do a kind
of<00:04:06.209> not<00:04:06.629> reboot<00:04:07.139> or<00:04:07.349> recasted<00:04:08.010> Iron<00:04:08.160> Man<00:04:08.370> 4<00:04:08.549> for

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
of not reboot or recasted Iron Man 4 for

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.189 
of not reboot or recasted Iron Man 4 for
