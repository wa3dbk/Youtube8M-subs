00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.880 

so<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> lot<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.540> folks<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.990> questions<00:00:07.290> about

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
so a lot of folks have questions about

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.540 
so a lot of folks have questions about
plumbing<00:00:08.400> their<00:00:09.210> systems<00:00:09.660> in<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.340> it's<00:00:11.340> kind

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
plumbing their systems in and it's kind

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.100 
plumbing their systems in and it's kind
of<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.820> big<00:00:12.000> question<00:00:12.509> but<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:12.870> something

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
of a big question but it's something

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.930 
of a big question but it's something
that's<00:00:13.290> very<00:00:13.710> easy<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> very

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
that's very easy to do and it's a very

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.519 
that's very easy to do and it's a very
rewarding<00:00:15.089> part<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> building<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.199> system

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
rewarding part of building a system

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.870 
rewarding part of building a system
because<00:00:16.800> oftentimes<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.520> make<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.850> go

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
because oftentimes you can make it go

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
because oftentimes you can make it go
really<00:00:18.300> fast<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:19.140> kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.560> Legos<00:00:19.800> for

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
really fast it's kind of like Legos for

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.790 
really fast it's kind of like Legos for
adults<00:00:20.570> so<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.930> talk<00:00:22.080> about<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
adults so I'm going to talk about the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620 
adults so I'm going to talk about the
two<00:00:23.010> types<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.490> tubing<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.269> you'll<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.600> using

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
two types of tubing that you'll be using

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.929 
two types of tubing that you'll be using
of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> two<00:00:25.320> types<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.710> pipe<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.789> going

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
of the two types of pipe and I'm going

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
of the two types of pipe and I'm going
to<00:00:26.970> talk<00:00:27.150> about<00:00:27.300> how<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.750> basically<00:00:28.410> fit<00:00:28.890> them

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
to talk about how we basically fit them

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.659 
to talk about how we basically fit them
together<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> there's<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.679> major<00:00:31.859> types<00:00:32.489> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
together so there's two major types of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
together so there's two major types of
pipe<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.719> systems<00:00:34.230> really

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
pipe that I use in my systems really

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
pipe that I use in my systems really
regularly<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> recommend<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.329> first

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
regularly and that I recommend the first

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350 
regularly and that I recommend the first
is<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.290> poly<00:00:38.160> tubing<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> Paul

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is a poly tubing like this it's a Paul

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.959 
is a poly tubing like this it's a Paul
epic<00:00:39.690> polyethylene<00:00:40.530> plastic<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.370> it's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
epic polyethylene plastic and it's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
epic polyethylene plastic and it's
somewhat<00:00:42.390> flexible<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.620> allows<00:00:43.860> us<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
somewhat flexible so it allows us to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
somewhat flexible so it allows us to
kind<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> send<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> around<00:00:44.969> corners<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.750> do

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
kind of send it around corners and do

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
kind of send it around corners and do
some<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.710> interesting<00:00:46.920> things<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.579> avoid

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
some really interesting things and avoid

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
some really interesting things and avoid
spending<00:00:48.390> money<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.660> l's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
spending money on l's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.630 
spending money on l's
okay<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.899> we<00:00:51.899> mostly<00:00:52.140> use<00:00:52.379> 1-inch<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.460> our

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
okay so we mostly use 1-inch for our

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
okay so we mostly use 1-inch for our
mains<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.539> we're<00:00:55.110> running<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
mains because we're running off of a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.310 
mains because we're running off of a
large<00:00:56.010> pump<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.780> half-inch<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> our

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
large pump and half-inch for all of our

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
large pump and half-inch for all of our
little<00:00:58.620> feeder<00:00:58.859> lines<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.850> stuff<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
little feeder lines and this stuff is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
little feeder lines and this stuff is
really<00:01:00.510> great<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.050> flexible<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really great because it's flexible and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
really great because it's flexible and
you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.180> sorts<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> things

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you can make it do all sorts of things

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
you can make it do all sorts of things
without<00:01:03.930> putting<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> l's<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
without putting in l's and that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.100 
without putting in l's and that
essentially<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.450> increases<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
essentially just increases the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870 
essentially just increases the
efficiency<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.890> pump<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.640> water

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
efficiency of your pump and your water

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.109 
efficiency of your pump and your water
pressure<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.390> system<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.939> for<00:01:11.939> these

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pressure in your system so for these

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
pressure in your system so for these
types<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.840> plastics<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.500> primarily<00:01:13.770> use

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
types of plastics we primarily use

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
types of plastics we primarily use
barbed<00:01:14.520> fittings<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.840> pretty

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
barbed fittings and it's pretty

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
barbed fittings and it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
self-explanatory it's it's just a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.179 
self-explanatory it's it's just a
fitting<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.420> barbed<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.470> fits<00:01:19.920> into

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
fitting that is barbed and it fits into

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
fitting that is barbed and it fits into
the<00:01:20.340> end<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> pipe<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the end of the pipe just like so now you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
the end of the pipe just like so now you
might<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> use<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> hairdryer<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.060> heat

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
might need to use a hairdryer or a heat

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
might need to use a hairdryer or a heat
gun<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> essentially<00:01:25.290> heat<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> plastic

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
gun to essentially heat up the plastic

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
gun to essentially heat up the plastic
to<00:01:26.369> squish<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.960> once<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.409> on

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to squish it on here but once it's on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.819 
to squish it on here but once it's on
there<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.939> stay<00:01:30.350> now<00:01:31.350> unless<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
there it's gonna stay now unless you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
there it's gonna stay now unless you
live<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.909> hot<00:01:33.240> place<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.170> probably

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
live in a really hot place you probably

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.399 
live in a really hot place you probably
don't<00:01:34.860> need<00:01:35.070> hose<00:01:35.369> fittings<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.299> because<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
don't need hose fittings but because it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
don't need hose fittings but because it
gets<00:01:37.680> pretty<00:01:37.920> hot<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.400> at<00:01:38.549> times<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
gets pretty hot here at times and the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
gets pretty hot here at times and the
sunshine<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> pretty<00:01:40.079> bright<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:41.280> put<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
sunshine is pretty bright we put on

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.780 
sunshine is pretty bright we put on
either<00:01:42.180> crimp<00:01:42.810> type<00:01:43.170> hose<00:01:43.829> clamps<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
either crimp type hose clamps like this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.950 
either crimp type hose clamps like this
or<00:01:45.470> stainless<00:01:46.470> steel<00:01:46.649> bolt<00:01:47.549> type<00:01:47.820> hose<00:01:48.540> clamps

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
or stainless steel bolt type hose clamps

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600

fittings barbed fittings are the primary
ones<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.560> use<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:02.310> types<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
ones that we use in these types of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
ones that we use in these types of
systems<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.290> type<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> pipe<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> we

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
systems the other type of pipe that we

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.630 
systems the other type of pipe that we
use<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> lot<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.909> PVC<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.890> recommend

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
use a lot of is PVC now I recommend

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.369 
use a lot of is PVC now I recommend
going<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.030> poly<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.629> much<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.140> can

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
going with the poly as much as you can

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.309 
going with the poly as much as you can
but<00:02:11.039> when<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> can't<00:02:11.730> PVC<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
but when you can't PVC is

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.250 
but when you can't PVC is
is<00:02:13.590> pretty<00:02:14.280> good<00:02:14.430> stuff<00:02:14.700> too<00:02:14.939> so<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:16.109> big

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
is pretty good stuff too so the big

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.750 
is pretty good stuff too so the big
thing<00:02:16.439> with<00:02:16.530> PVC<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.159> make<00:02:17.340> sure<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.730> have

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
thing with PVC is make sure you have

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.089 
thing with PVC is make sure you have
down<00:02:18.239> all<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> your<00:02:18.749> measurements<00:02:19.379> before<00:02:19.889> you

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
down all of your measurements before you

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.190 
down all of your measurements before you
start<00:02:20.400> cutting<00:02:20.609> this<00:02:20.849> stuff<00:02:20.969> up<00:02:21.359> you<00:02:22.049> can

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
start cutting this stuff up you can

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
start cutting this stuff up you can
always<00:02:22.379> put<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.799> slips<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.340> will<00:02:23.519> fit

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
always put in slips that will fit

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.309 
always put in slips that will fit
together<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.239> pieces<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.959> cut<00:02:25.139> too

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
together to pieces that you cut too

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.410 
together to pieces that you cut too
short<00:02:25.349> but<00:02:26.159> by<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.489> large<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.939> want<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.269> have

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
short but by and large you want to have

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.440 
short but by and large you want to have
a<00:02:27.450> really<00:02:27.810> solid<00:02:28.200> understanding<00:02:28.499> of<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
a really solid understanding of the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.899 
a really solid understanding of the
lengths<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> need<00:02:31.109> to<00:02:31.260> run<00:02:31.469> and<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.370> corners

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
lengths you need to run and the corners

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.280 
lengths you need to run and the corners
you<00:02:32.939> need<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.359> make<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.719> the<00:02:33.780> tees<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.019> need

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you need to make and the tees you need

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.849 
you need to make and the tees you need
to<00:02:34.379> put<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.739> now<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.939> stuff<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.269> expensive

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
to put in now this stuff is expensive

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.409 
to put in now this stuff is expensive
fittings<00:02:37.859> are<00:02:38.010> expensive<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.670> more<00:02:38.939> you're

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:39.419 
fittings are expensive the more you're

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.069 
fittings are expensive the more you're
doing<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:41.040> more<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.340> adds<00:02:41.519> up<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:41.939> if<00:02:42.930> you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
doing the the more it adds up so if you

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.670 
doing the the more it adds up so if you
can<00:02:43.260> use<00:02:43.439> poly<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:44.219> avoid<00:02:44.579> using<00:02:45.030> else<00:02:45.180> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
can use poly to avoid using else I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.000 
can use poly to avoid using else I
highly<00:02:46.680> recommend<00:02:47.159> it<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.849> if<00:02:48.000> you're<00:02:48.180> with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
highly recommend it so if you're with

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.220 
highly recommend it so if you're with
PVC<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:50.669> it's<00:02:50.849> not<00:02:50.969> a<00:02:51.000> flexible<00:02:51.540> pipe<00:02:51.780> we

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
PVC because it's not a flexible pipe we

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.129 
PVC because it's not a flexible pipe we
can't<00:02:52.469> use<00:02:52.650> barbed<00:02:53.099> fittings<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.719> have<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
can't use barbed fittings so we have to

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.979 
can't use barbed fittings so we have to
use<00:02:55.349> essentially<00:02:55.949> PVC<00:02:56.549> fittings<00:02:56.909> or<00:02:57.299> buy<00:02:57.510> PVC

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
use essentially PVC fittings or buy PVC

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.909 
use essentially PVC fittings or buy PVC
fittings<00:02:58.349> oh<00:02:58.469> here<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.579> go

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
fittings oh here we go

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.530 
fittings oh here we go
PVC<00:03:01.919> fittings<00:03:02.400> are<00:03:02.549> typically<00:03:03.000> either<00:03:03.030> slip

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
PVC fittings are typically either slip

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.800 
PVC fittings are typically either slip
or<00:03:04.199> threaded<00:03:04.769> okay<00:03:05.159> so<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.000> slip<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.480> what

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
or threaded okay so the slip is what

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.520 
or threaded okay so the slip is what
fits<00:03:07.109> onto<00:03:07.439> our<00:03:08.180> PVC<00:03:09.180> pipe<00:03:09.419> and<00:03:09.659> you're<00:03:10.409> going

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
fits onto our PVC pipe and you're going

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.420 
fits onto our PVC pipe and you're going
to<00:03:10.590> have<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.829> use<00:03:10.980> glue<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.699> do<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.480> all<00:03:12.930> right

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
to have to use glue to do that all right

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.949 
to have to use glue to do that all right
so<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.579> stuff<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.879> expensive<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.629> little<00:03:15.870> bit

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
so this stuff is expensive a little bit

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.360 
so this stuff is expensive a little bit
goes<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.139> long<00:03:16.379> way<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.739> actually<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.129> pipe

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
goes a long way it's actually a pipe

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.920 
goes a long way it's actually a pipe
well<00:03:17.639> we're<00:03:17.879> actually<00:03:18.000> welding<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.780> two

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
well we're actually welding the two

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.960 
well we're actually welding the two
pieces<00:03:19.169> of<00:03:19.290> plastic<00:03:19.560> together<00:03:19.979> so<00:03:20.819> you're

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
pieces of plastic together so you're

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.429 
pieces of plastic together so you're
going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.120> have<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.329> go<00:03:21.419> buy<00:03:21.599> some<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.139> and

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
going to have to go buy some of this and

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.229 
going to have to go buy some of this and
I<00:03:22.739> would<00:03:22.889> recommend<00:03:23.040> getting<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.579> primer<00:03:23.909> too

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
I would recommend getting a primer too

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.210 
I would recommend getting a primer too
especially<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:24.810> you're<00:03:24.930> using<00:03:25.079> old<00:03:25.409> ugly<00:03:25.829> pipe

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
especially if you're using old ugly pipe

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.559 
especially if you're using old ugly pipe
that<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.459> salvaged<00:03:26.879> from<00:03:27.090> something<00:03:27.449> else

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
that you salvaged from something else

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.530 
that you salvaged from something else
it's<00:03:28.560> going<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.769> help<00:03:28.949> those<00:03:29.609> pieces<00:03:30.180> weld

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
it's going to help those pieces weld

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.199 
it's going to help those pieces weld
real<00:03:30.810> nice<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.769> make<00:03:32.669> sure<00:03:32.699> you<00:03:32.939> have<00:03:33.060> your

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
real nice so make sure you have your

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.629 
real nice so make sure you have your
measurements<00:03:33.389> down<00:03:33.870> cut<00:03:34.470> your<00:03:34.650> pipe<00:03:34.859> weld<00:03:35.459> it

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
measurements down cut your pipe weld it

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.509 
measurements down cut your pipe weld it
together<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:37.500> sets<00:03:37.859> really<00:03:38.099> quick<00:03:38.400> and
