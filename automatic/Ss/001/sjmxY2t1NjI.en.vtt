00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:12.280
 Everybody today is coming to the venue of the Tokyo International Anime Fair 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.500
 Today I have a slight voice about business data 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.730
 Please forgive me 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.060
 The total number of exhibitors at the Tokyo International Anime Fair 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.720
 It is a number that is almost the same as the average year but 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:32.349
 I feel that each booth is very small. 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.280
 So although I feel that the Well overall I wonder if the lack of a little that liveliness 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.490
 Too 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.090
 With Nippon Television 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.660
 Is Studio Ghibli of the booth I Well in its own way 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.420
 That neat 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.250
 I think I 'm working hard 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.120
 Well then today 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 In remodeling, you 've entered such a clear folder 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.129
 We distribute set of 8 flyers 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.379
 Of course, even though I'm giving away this Arrietty to this audience and promotion 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.570
 It has a very good reputation 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:05.170
 It was impressive to say that the customers want them really want and take them to the next 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.360
 It it is from that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.090
 Well at the venue 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.130
 With Cecil's promotional video 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.579
 If put but I'm flowing the trailer some people devour the notice and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.020
 Cecil's notice it is to look at that promotional video 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.990
 It is to say that some people are saying something like that to make also there Arrietty live-action 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.549
 Well I thought it might be interesting 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:34.869
 Then there are other things Arie t 10 for the first time 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:39.970
 I also put out a visual here , but I also advertised that 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:44.920
 There are quite a few people who stop doing this and it is used while saying who Yohei Taneda is 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.480
 People who have leaked the impressions that I say say it I Ah'm such a movie great is doing person is in 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 Also there were 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:57.160
 It is Kaiserslautern is but technique to it came to be seen for the other is I mini-book also hand 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:02.830
 I think this is not the case, but take a picture while reading it like earnestly one by one 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:06.220
 There are people who went, but I hope that this is not abused . 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.500
 8 Well today is it about press day 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.600
 that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:18.230
 I do not think that the mass media's help does not arrive for a while 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:22.590
 There are many other people from that overseas, so it seems like I'm interested in acupuncture. 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:28.500
 People from Spanish broadcasters also went and other things 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:33.210
 Asian people were coming, but after all there was a question and it was all about at 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:37.260
 Then I thought there was one more web media this year 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.670
 TV shows on the web and radios on the web 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.760
 A lot is coming 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:50.160
 Somehow this is possible, but I'm delivering the action in Nismo an-web though 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.290
 I realized that the same kind of medium is actually suddenly increasing here in about a year 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.200
 Better was Well that 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.660
 I have is for everyone's 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.490
 If you search at Tokyo International Anime Fair Studio Ghibli , a surprising program is found 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.040

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.980
 It is possible to search like this, so various information may be flowing there, so a little everyone 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 Mr. I thought that want to go 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.590
 Although it will be from the tomorrow that will be in the general 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.510
 Version examples are more crowded and this flyer 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.319
