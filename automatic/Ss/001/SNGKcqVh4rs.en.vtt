of like a week behind and CLG have
stepped<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> saw<00:00:29.460> towards<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> mid

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
stepped it up you saw towards the mid

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.030 
stepped it up you saw towards the mid
game<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.630> completely<00:00:31.050> pulled<00:00:31.439> ahead<00:00:31.560> they

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
game they completely pulled ahead they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.889 
game they completely pulled ahead they
use<00:00:32.219> their<00:00:32.460> wave<00:00:32.669> manipulation<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:33.540> used

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
use their wave manipulation they used

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.080 
use their wave manipulation they used
like<00:00:34.380> giant<00:00:34.800> waves<00:00:34.920> bottom<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.670> pressure

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
like giant waves bottom to pressure

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.869 
like giant waves bottom to pressure
things<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.660> dragon<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:37.980> red<00:00:38.670> buff

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
things like dragon and they use red buff

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
trading for things like dragon it seems

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
trading for things like dragon it seems
like<00:00:40.980> odd<00:00:41.309> ones<00:00:41.760> view<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> jungle<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.110> not

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
like odd ones view of the jungle is not

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.440 
like odd ones view of the jungle is not
on<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.010> macro<00:00:44.399> level<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.820> Dexter's<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
on that macro level that Dexter's is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
on that macro level that Dexter's is
because<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> implementation<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
because with the implementation of

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
because with the implementation of
wriggles<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.989> Saint<00:00:49.260> keeps<00:00:49.440> saying<00:00:49.649> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
wriggles as Saint keeps saying like

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.619 
wriggles as Saint keeps saying like
Dragon<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.399> kind<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.789> been<00:00:50.910> unlocked<00:00:51.360> much

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
yeah they just played around the the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.039 
yeah they just played around the the
wriggles<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.250> every<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.210> TSM

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
wriggles really well every time that TSM

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
wriggles really well every time that TSM
would<00:01:16.170> go<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:16.950> objective<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.520> TSM

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
would go for an objective that TSM

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.460 
would go for an objective that TSM
thought<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.630> valuable<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> blue

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
thought was really valuable like a blue

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.499 
thought was really valuable like a blue
ball<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.860> red<00:01:19.979> buff<00:01:20.159> seals<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.790> okay<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
ball for red buff seals like okay like I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
ball for red buff seals like okay like I
kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> global<00:01:22.770> gold<00:01:22.950> from<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
kind of like the global gold from a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
kind of like the global gold from a
dragon<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:23.670> Tara<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.150> better<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
dragon or Tara a lot better and that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260 
dragon or Tara a lot better and that
game<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.640> decided<00:01:27.150> in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
game I think was really decided in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.990 
game I think was really decided in
champions<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.750> CLG<00:01:28.259> knew<00:01:28.380> exactly<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.460> TS

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
champions like CLG knew exactly what TS

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
what TF lanes fine again steadily and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.469 
what TF lanes fine again steadily and
they<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.729> nice<00:01:45.060> global

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
they got that really nice global

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
they got that really nice global
pressure<00:01:45.659> they<00:01:45.840> wanted<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> global

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
pressure they wanted in the global

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.080 
pressure they wanted in the global
pressure<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.399> kept<00:01:47.579> snowballing<00:01:47.850> into

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
pressure just kept snowballing into

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
pressure just kept snowballing into
kills<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> kept<00:01:48.750> taking<00:01:48.990> things<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
kills that kept taking things off and of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.990 
kills that kept taking things off and of
course<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.220> talked<00:01:50.399> about<00:01:50.490> picking<00:01:50.820> gagement

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
course we talked about picking gagement

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
course we talked about picking gagement
Italy<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:51.750> guys<00:01:51.899> teleport<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.380> top<00:01:52.500> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
Italy but two guys teleport on top of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.840 
Italy but two guys teleport on top of
you<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:52.950> easy<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> grab<00:01:53.310> fights<00:01:53.520> yeah

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you is really easy to grab fights yeah

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.090 
you is really easy to grab fights yeah
especially<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> way<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.770> game<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
especially with the way that the game is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
especially with the way that the game is
changing<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.329> abilities<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
changing right now the abilities that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
changing right now the abilities that
allow<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.439> cover<00:01:58.710> large<00:01:59.130> distances<00:01:59.240> have

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
allow you to cover large distances have

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.569 
allow you to cover large distances have
increasing<00:02:00.780> importance<00:02:01.740> dramatically<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
increasing importance dramatically and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
increasing importance dramatically and
so<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.390> bringing<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> TF

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so I really like bringing in the TF

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.399 
so I really like bringing in the TF
early<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.579> early<00:02:05.880> top<00:02:06.390> dive<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.960> think

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
early it was the early top dive I think

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.559 
early it was the early top dive I think
that<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.770> showed<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.220> first<00:02:08.520> when<00:02:09.090> TSM

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
that really showed this first when TSM

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.780 
that really showed this first when TSM
were<00:02:09.660> able<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> commit<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.470> top<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.489> kill

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
were able to commit up top get that kill

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 
were able to commit up top get that kill
and<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.360> didn't<00:02:12.930> even<00:02:13.260> lose

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and they didn't even lose

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
and they didn't even lose
Bagon<00:02:14.160> they<00:02:14.280> didn't<00:02:14.550> even<00:02:14.640> lose<00:02:14.940> mid<00:02:15.270> they

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
Bagon they didn't even lose mid they

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
Bagon they didn't even lose mid they
were<00:02:15.540> able<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.900> recover<00:02:16.230> their<00:02:16.530> positioning

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
were able to recover their positioning

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
were able to recover their positioning
after<00:02:17.580> gaining<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.030> advantage<00:02:18.390> yeah<00:02:18.959> yeah

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
after gaining that advantage yeah yeah
