00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 7 or windows 8 in troicki 4 so I 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.980
 need a skin pack I would put you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.349
 it will come from registration for the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.000
 free so once you have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.970
 downloaded you launch it you have a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 course loading so here we are 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.189
 on the app or done next there you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 are obliged to accept in order to be able to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 to continue is like what you are 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 okay s kiddies guys like me you 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.570
 so here he proposes to download and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 to install pop 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 so what about browsers me that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.289
 do not interest me so what I do 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.050
 it's I click here next so two 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.680
 grindstones not install but also that which does not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.270
 do not address me so I click club and I 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.289
 Do the same 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 so here we go really 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.290
 facilities even so see you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.830
 finally proposes they go all the elements 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.180
 that he will install 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.950
 so he will install icons 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.689
 so that's sliders theme and so of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.119
 after 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.950
 so you do install once 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.409
 the facility is donated that puts you 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 like what so small 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.799
 the installation is finished so you 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.380
 do next there is you restart 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.500
 now or so you were hitting 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 later 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.759
 I advise you directly of the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 do so you click on finish and the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.740
 machine will restart automatically 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.619
 so we can see the theme has already been 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.229
 installed and therefore a reboot 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.229
 will allow to completely see the theme 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 so as to see the wallpaper has 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.659
 changed so we have the new logo 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 android so kit kat 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.799
 we can also killer luring himself who has 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.110
 changed then this famous cursor moves there 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.130
 I think it's nice enough I'm going to celebrate 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.350
 this one for example here they overlook the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.539
 left side is like that it overlooks the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.030
 right 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.290
 pass small features that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.340
 I noticed there is probably 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:23.930
 others invite to see them in the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.930
 options which is so option on wii 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:32.150
 yes it's all new pointer that 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.150
 have been added I already have good quibble 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:47.819
 his fame and come back so see cl 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.379
 slider lan normally does not exist and 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.769
 using this theme so they've been 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.769
 added 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.489
 when you can see the bar of 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.269
 tasks was therefore to that mother was 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.220
 placed above 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.439
 if you do not like what you 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.060
 can do is look at hawks and the 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.879
 did not julio facts if she locked 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.379
 you unlock and you can the 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:13.799
 put back underneath so you hold 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:16.199
 the left click up and then we go so 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.620
 simply that the cursor has to maintain 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.620
 to put it back 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:31.010
 good my heart will come if I think that 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:38.510
 I'm on a virtual machine at 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:44.709
 cesti the doc quests i do not know it's 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:47.930
 what a little intox a fake wood 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.500
 so regarding the icons you 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.930
 see they have changed all but 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.489
 otherwise your windows stays the same so 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.170
 your files not be moved that's 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.959
 the appearance of windows in the same 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.720
 If so I changed my lien2 scription 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.769
 to download the little quine here 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 also the questions then always the 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.019
 even put them in the comments 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.750
 here in case you want it 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.280
 uninstall will simply suffice 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.760
 to go into programs and 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.200
 features and therefore delete 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.790
 this one so what is not they 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.140
 capture one towards an inversion and this 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.419
 so see had settled today 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.419
 and at the same time and so here
