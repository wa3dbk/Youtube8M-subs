00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 I present you there 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600
 a car that we would all like 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.459
 know has a chassis made of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.020
 super resistant aluminum that gives you the 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:13.620
 dimensions and proportions of 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.740
 typical aerodynamic roadster powerful 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.230
 exotic elegant all the elements of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.390
 a roadster 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.390
 but because this is the car of the future 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.850
 gina has something very special under 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.850
 hood 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.060
 instead of a car with a body 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.150
 steel or carbon fiber we do 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.460
 all the car with a full skin that is 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.560
 Very elastic can cover all kinds of 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.360
 structures and in fact this structure 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.670
 from here is the substructure that we 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.140
 Protects in an accident and the skin makes 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 that a normal sports car is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.400
 transform into the sport of the future if 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 we want to wake up gina first 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.420
 will ask you to open your eyes and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 go on waking up because that's where 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.530
 see that the personality of a car is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.649
 patent hello there you have it you could 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 give us some super light light 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 is distributed throughout the focus we 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.460
 shows the structure and also gives 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.619
 certain personality 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.479
 chris bangle that was inspired stretching 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.610
 a stocking on a clothes hanger has 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.140
 worked on the concept of nice car and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.620
 has taken it to limits that many of 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.990
 we can not imagine 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.760
 gina is not based only on a material that 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.620
 it is stretched it is about opening our 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.150
 to a new chassis concept that 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.340
 let us see the materials from 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.500
 another optics if today I have to take a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.510
 lots of things to the container and I need 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 more space in the rear of the car this 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.290
 will have to change to adapt but 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.150
 tomorrow it turns out that I'm going to a party with 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.430
 my wife and I would like the car 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.930
 it was as elegant as we do not 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.450
 It would be ideal to have a car like that 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.020
 versatile denmark the beginning of a 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.329
 was of changing mobility 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.740
 imagine a car that is transformed to 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.840
 adapt to any of our 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 needs if the cars are really 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.229
 our avatar an external reflection of what 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.670
 that we are before the rest of the world 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.770
 it is logical that as we 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.929
 we change and evolve as people 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.460
 and our relationships with others the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.460
 cars must change with us
