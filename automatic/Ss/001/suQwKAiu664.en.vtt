00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.510
 I received today a sample of 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.630
 brand bluetooth speaker 4.0 in 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.590
 chorus so the product is carefully 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.470
 packaged and so we have the top 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.020
 speaker who is also hands-free 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.000
 Moreover we can specify the record 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.789
 of use and cables the cable of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.309
 micro usb charging and a jack cable for 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.020
 use it without bluetooth or if the 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 device does not have 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.719
 bluetooth functionality 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.950
 so we can see the finish of the 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:49.420
 product is really perfect so a 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:54.100
 glossy black with on the underside a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.680
 anti-slip surface that allows to be 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.800
 the product to be stable and not to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.469
 not scratching the surfaces so the little 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 switch on / off the line input for 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:12.189
 the jack cable turns on so here's a 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.109
 times the product to him but we still have 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:19.590
 more than the pair and pressing 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:19.590
 long on the play key 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.619
 here we are ready to the pair is in 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:30.279
 blue tooth and we see the seer 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:36.909
 flash orange or rather red and 

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:45.749
 blue so I'm going the pair is on a 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 little ipad mini and that's it 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:52.560
 as can be seen on the ipad 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.560
 and now place to music 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.540
 we can drive the device from 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.540
 the speaker 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.450
 yes so indeed the speaker is 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.069
 equipped with a battery that is recharged 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.800
 with the supplied micro USB cord and we 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.709
 branch either on a computer or in 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.980
 my case on an external battery in 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.150
 choir also by the way very good product 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.500
 we see the charge indicator in red on 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.840
 blue means that it is well connected 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:24.850
 also on my ipad so a light of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.850
 each side very convenient 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.769
 to summarize so I'm really 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:38.170
 satisfied with the product top speakers 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.599
 very good quality but also kit 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.319
 hands- free thanks to the microphone placed at 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:46.780
 the speaker base at the level 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.629
 autonomy therefore on the different tests 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.269
 that I could lead one can say about 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.739
 six hours at high power and 8th at 10am 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.849
 reduced power 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.459
 I was able to connect it in bluetooth 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.290
 but also thanks to the jack cable the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.169
 two work very well at the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.359
 dimensions it's really small the 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.879
 hotkeys allow on the 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.639
 low iron volume + volume - play pause 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.060
 and fast forward previous song or 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:19.419
 next game and we can also 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.070
 use siri with the iphone a brief 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.400
 great product that I recommend to 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.400
 everybody
