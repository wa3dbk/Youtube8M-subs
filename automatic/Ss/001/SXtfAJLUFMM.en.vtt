thoughts and I and research being behind
this<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:29.910> that's<00:00:30.150> what<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:31.230> are

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
this and I think that's what we are

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920 
this and I think that's what we are
banking<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.730> gonna<00:00:32.910> pay<00:00:33.149> back<00:00:33.360> very<00:00:33.690> good

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
