00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello everyone then see me again with a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.740
 new very short video that will me 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.790
 allow to introduce you to garden in 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.809
 this April 9, 2015 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.700
 so obviously the month of April is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.100
 not the least the most extravagant at 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 garden of less than there and yet it's 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.359
 an important moment in the vegetable garden 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 particular to start his break from 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.960
 early manner is considered several 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 rotations on a parcel obviously 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.929
 it's still a way to optimize 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 space because finally in 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.700
 grow vegetables between May and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 September is relatively simple but 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.270
 start his season in january for the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.620
 finish in December it becomes a lot 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.809
 more complex then already and I took advantage 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.110
 of winter to evolve some 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.719
 elements of the garden givet added me 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.890
 do as we see if it does not allow 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.809
 beyond growing tomatoes in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.829
 summer but mostly do not start early 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.710
 some vegetables and grow to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.130
 other vegetables winter contest I 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.390
 brought to the garden straw bales 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 to test the culture on boots like 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 described in our arms joel cartel who 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.890
 is titled to be precise gardening 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.210
 on straw boots 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.020
 so these culture techniques such 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.090
 that it is described in the books 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.189
 requires a lot of nitrogen fertilizer to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 about 500 grams per butt a shape 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.990
 a lot and so I'm going to test this summer 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 the replacement of reality by him 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.369
 nothing because their unconsciousness five to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.020
 eight grams of alcohol per liter and I 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.040
 think it can work I you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.329
 will give the results elsewhere in 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.329
 a next bubble 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.570
 I also created this little backpack 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.009
 against the wall that allows me to have 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 a land they warm up fast enough 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.200
 at the beginning of the season and then 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.490
 to optimize the space ok my wall 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.759
 so if I do not do now on the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.400
 different cultures 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.380
 we have in the garden right now 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.060
 you have here you and vegetables that have 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.000
 spent the winter in the garden that I planted 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.340
 to be precise on October 6th 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.170
 spinach salads and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 beets 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.200
 so obviously at 6 October it's 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.490
 forbidden for for sowing or for 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.070
 to transplant to the garden but that said I 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.900
 wanted to test she is she the date 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.480
 maximum haddad limit to which one 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.940
 could consider reclicking his vegetables 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.600
 to the garden in winter and I find that the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.640
 results are more than encouraging 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.890
 because slab or saw him relaying 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.880
 looters are ready to eat and that's to 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.880
 about the same for salads 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 salads as you roll on the road 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.280
 have also passed the roles so if 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.120
 they are ready to be eaten you 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 have on his boards 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.240
 a defeat against the building that have 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 been those born before winter also 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.170
 for those who are too flower those 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.000
 who make a first white they were 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 sounded a few weeks ago and so 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.890
 you see well that misdeeds named 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.000
 by way of price in the price of 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.460
 peas last week 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.570
 turnips who spent the winter in the garden 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.890
 also and that are slippery are 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.390
 to be eaten before even though some 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.940
 volunteers drives a nation more 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:31.330
 comfortable you have on this board 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.500
 of spinach, cabbage and 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.900
 peas 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.790
 so all these vegetables were sown at 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.490
 spring sometimes very early in the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.140
 house a minimum but they do not have 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.670
 spent the winter in the garden then after you 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.060
 have the greenhouse where I really started 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.050
 very early some vegetables 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.610
 all the vegetables you see 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.650
 were sown February 14 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.740
 you see spinach from the Nazis there 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.870
 rally of peas and carrots 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:07.060
 and I start eating the first 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.740
 rallies and light spinach 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.870
 systematically covered with a veil of 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:16.150
 forcing for the nests and vegetables of the 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.750
 firm you have on select last 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.250
 culture boards of associations 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.100
 enter 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.540
 salads and seedlings of 40 and parsnips that 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.110
 have not risen yet so you see 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.770
 no and the carrots that are on the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.330
 left of the image 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.300
 well, these are carrots that the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.070
 peaks before winter also and who 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.320
 leave with great vigor in this 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.440
 beginning of the season so we can see 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.580
 the interest of this dish even late in 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.430
 end of season these are vegetables 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.150
 globally that starts with a lot 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.810
 of advanced spring is finally to finish 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.880
 a small point on the tomatoes that gesture 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.130
 would put very early in the season and there I 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.560
 think I was a little more optimistic 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.280
 I sowed these tomatoes indoors or 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.220
 at the beginning of February 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.910
 and of course today and well they 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.700
 are already big 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.410
 they have undergone three potting and have them 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.300
 sense still too cold for me 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.710
 can put them in the garden so my 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.880
 goal now is to succeed at 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.050
 to wait patiently for mucus 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.640
 to transplant them into a good 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.380
 condition I do not know if it's okay 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.909
 walk 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.020
 here 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.699
 I give you an appointment in a 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.419
 next video I will try to do 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:31.819
 I think this summer by then do not hesitate 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.710
 to contact me on my email if you 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.710
 wish there is soon
