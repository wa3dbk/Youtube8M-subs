00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.410
 I am javier mutal and we are not in 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 santa barbara in california a test 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.539
 of the new lincoln farm 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.800
 2015 in the new one is sub and median that 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.890
 comes to compete in a segment 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 really very complicated because there 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.469
 too many very good models that 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.079
 offer a high level of design of 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.179
 performance implementation of new 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.479
 technologies and that the lincoln that is 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:49.149
 let's say in a rebirth campaign 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.280
 of reinvention that they are trying to 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.239
 practically save the brand the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.809
 luxury division forks happened 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.670
 for some problems in terms of low 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.620
 sales volumes not so much for the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.250
 quality of the cars that has always been 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.050
 very good but for precisely lack of 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.050
 new products 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.630
 in case and good is trying to give a 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.760
 boost the brand precisely as 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.550
 we said to compete in the segment of 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.180
 the mid-size luxury sessions he has 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.790
 grown in all segments as soon as 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.740
 to luxury as such and only from 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.100
 luxury but the luxury sports 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.030
 example there comes the post mccann 2015 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.980
 that although it is more oriented to the management 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.220
 sports is also a luxury brand 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.990
 there is also the audi five that is that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.840
 enters the purely luxury segment and 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.360
 more or less to the same ranges of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.910
 price that is in case and that by the way 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.780
 starts at a base price around 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.100
 of 37 thousand dollars and reaches 50 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.110
 thousand like this model that we are 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.860
 driving that is the one that has motor 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.010
 four-cylinder 2.3-liter ecoboost that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.830
 produces 285 horsepower and also 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.870
 has the all wheel drive system a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.330
 automatic transmission of five changes 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.580
 and this new 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.440
 and implementation of the controls of the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.270
 transmission that no longer has the lever 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.940
 here in the center console but 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.450
 simply the buttons that are handled 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.390
 directly here on the console 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.700
 central a good driving experience 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.520
 we have traveled here in california today 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.680
 around santa barbara around 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.350
 200 miles and we have had a performance 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.720
 average of 21.3 miles per gallon of 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.410
 gasoline we must also recognize that 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.000
 We have been driving on roads 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.250
 quite aggressive with many curves 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 elevation that were lent precisely 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.610
 to demand the most from this engine 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.430
 ecoboost of 4 cylinders and 285 horses 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.600
 of strength and in that sense he responded very 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.330
 well in terms of performance accelerates and 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.030
 properly has a good control a 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.360
 good driving the steering wheel has three 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.620
 comfort modes the normal one that 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.720
 is the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.739
 and the sports and really when one 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.360
 press here on the speed change 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.080
 it's about the center console 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.440
 the word mode and it really feels a 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.450
 radical change in terms of 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.709
 acceleration take much longer to 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.040
 they lengthen the changes in the 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.260
 transmission there plus the response of 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.730
 accelerator adjusts a bit the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.329
 address also to do a handling 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.950
 a little more sporty so this is the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.810
 m 66 lincoln 2015 a model that has 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.920
 all the features that can be 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.660
 really expect a luxury sv 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.900
 good details good materials here 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.040
 in the interior cabin we see materials 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.540
 like this wood with open forum 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.970
 practically without any lacquering without 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.390
 No brightness above gives you a 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.280
 very attractive natural look at the steering wheel 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.650
 skin-lined feels like a 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.540
 very high quality material the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.609
 seats also quite comfortable as 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.440
 we said we handled more than 200 miles 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.370
 during some 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.890
 5 hours and even though it was quite 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.240
 demanding on the streets and roads was 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.310
 a tour that becomes very comfortable another 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.780
 Novelty is not new, actually because 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.900
 is in many models is the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.389
 they are panoramic roof of the xxi that covers 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.960
 the two rows of seats and there we have 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.860
 open halfway 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.360
 but that's the opening of the crystal and 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.110
 now the full opening 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.789
 what is the glass for the cabin 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.310
 back as all the models of 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.379
 lincoln comes with the new screen 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.599
 touch with all integrated systems 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:01.110
 here the navigation the audio controls 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:05.009
 of air conditioning with controls 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.009
 very easy to use 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.660
 there is the application of the system 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.480
 easy enough navigation all 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.010
 with the touch screen and how they gave us 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.100
 the instruction there can also be 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.100
 do through voice commands 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.339
 in the sport mode that as I said you can 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.800
 make the changes directly here in 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.629
 the central console with the commands 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.149
 transmission we also have the option of 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:40.580
 handle with the alerts here behind the 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.580
 steering wheel between the speed changes 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.139
 how can you see this 2.3 liter engine 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.389
 285 horsepower responds in a way 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.090
 more than adequate for the size and 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.270
 dimensions responds in way more than 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.750
 suitable for the size of this new in 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.940
 case and 2015 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.060
 lincoln will also offer a model 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.820
 with a 2-liter engine and obviously that 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.600
 is going to be the model with which is the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.830
 base price of around 37 thousand 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.460
 dollars is 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.410
 2.3L engine is around 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.110
 40 thousand dollars later when you're 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:26.210
 add all possible options 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.210
 it's around 50 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.910
 good by completing the initial text of the 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.330
 lincoln in casey 2015 here in santa 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.330
