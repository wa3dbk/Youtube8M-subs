00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.610
 I'm pretty happy to be here 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.900
 today hello to 12.1 all I hope 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.310
 you are happy to look at what 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.330
 except that there if you clicked there are 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.710
 chances are it's because the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.390
 title told you that it was not 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.150
 a type of good and I confirm it to you 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.320
 this clip is to him otherwise bah game but 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.250
 it may be too much for nothing I do not 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.240
 do not know but personally as soon as 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.520
 I saw I was like a phew 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.990
 and I said to myself I want it what I 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.120
 see my screen I want it you do not 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.559
 do not understand it's normal and you have to 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.489
 now look at the little title the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.989
 already displayed will give you a 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.219
 good idea but we go now and 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.559
 you will understand why I find 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.909
 it's it's just too much art as it 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:49.659
 the screen in any case it's a clip of the 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.979
 share this kid I like his sound 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.899
 gamertag as often I like them 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.010
 gamertags a little bit pgm you for 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.289
 the moment nothing extraordinary they 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.429
 have me in a world where you 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.989
 people see that weird stuff that 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.609
 white voucher centers are displayed 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.229
 see a weird warthog that appears 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.960
 ie without touraine and with them 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.400
 nine of eclairs still good they 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.690
 are of the century things are happening 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.880
 weird do not know what you think 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.130
 I'm not a guy who spends my life at 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 matchmaking but from what I saw in 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.940
 btb so far I have not seen that and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.870
 there this price where it is not your 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.460
 new if you think it was the 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.720
 Santa Claus no it's not him and if 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.890
 you think you saw what you saw 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.110
 did you see what you saw 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.340
 quite perfectly then there we get 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.360
 what is this shit 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.070
 does it go on my screen that gets 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.240
 does he pass in this part there we see 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.440
 even a warthog hundred paintings which 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.090
 a shitty thing with always this 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.800
 drag also states what is the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.210
 project well we'll see ja 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.770
 let's go back to this little sequence where 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.000
 the guys like idol was concerned about 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.050
 something obviously is indeed 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.610
 he was right because we see 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.870
 this kind of good line that falls 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.820
 and watched under my rule 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.070
 yes you have not dreamed no no you 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.360
 do not already have this little line of bond 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.580
 which reminds a bit for those who 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.870
 know worms who played in wenzhou 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.100
 for a moment we call a plane that makes 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.350
 fall of wills in the same way 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.120
 and so I thought to myself go to the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.680
 source and so I changed my mind and 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.910
 I was to see where this warthog came from 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.380
 and here it is to put the team 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.350
 blue so the opposing team who takes 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.510
 warthog having fun with that quite 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.130
 normal send already they were 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.950
 connected with thorpe spector seen send 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.690
 sa are for 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.310
 see thanks to a big a flash that puts 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.180
 of his visibly and there we can 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.640
 find that whenever they 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.400
 horns and goes it sends seven lines 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.720
 good this kind of dodo I do not know 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.489
 of air support do not know how 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.550
 you have this thing a little bit chelou 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.040
 this bombing bombing 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.390
 and so here I am hallucinating we 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.130
 let's warn against it according to him 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 pulls on it so it does not lose sight of 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 I want to believe that the bugs in 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.010
 online games have broad back 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.420
 here in this case I think more than 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.020
 effect it's really wrong that he removed 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.850
 his power 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.490
 momentarily for a party to be 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.410
 nice and suddenly he can fly he 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.150
 can do crazy stuff finally me I 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.620
 wants to be in fact there is no 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.030
 other term there is no other words there 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.130
 there is no other solution I just want 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.180
 know thug here is not necessarily mass 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.800
 mexico i do not care i just had to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.050
 like that for a part because bartok is 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.760
 just too much to and that's so at each 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.990
 times he during the whole party does this 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400
 what he wants what he finally has if he can 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.770
 fly and can send bombs 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.570
 so here he wanted to kill bartoli 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.740
 did not succeed but see and it will be that 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.240
 the whole party so I did not have any 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.190
 the rest of the game because the ofce 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.710
 to stop at the the globally that to 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.660
 wharton want the magic warthog that's 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.680
 this is the magic warthog the people the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.110
 more of me is a magic portal 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.880
 so listen I hope in any case what 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.960
 little cat clip will have provided you with 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.730
 pleasure as they die to produce a 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.840
 month just as personally I 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.130
 never met kind of situation 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.720
 major and movie if you already have 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.550
 met a warthog like that where in any 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.150

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.160

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.989

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.220

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.959
