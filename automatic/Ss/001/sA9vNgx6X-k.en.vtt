00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.950
 today 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.840
 truck and in quotes 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.260
 how can we know we have 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.860
 the sub tone cold or sub tone warm that 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.000
 as why as vice 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.040
 Well, I'll tell you right now 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.330
 comment truths that tell this in 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.329
 reality is to get into a berenjenal 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.009
 since it's something long to tell what 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.770
 that I want to know is what I mean 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.410
 I want to teach is how to find out if I am 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.110
 of its cold tone or its warm tone 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.510
 I do not want to explain what the sub means 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.969
 I do not say anything, but I'm going to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.820
 explain if someone walks detects the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.860
 sub tone of the skin is towards that strip 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.590
 towards which our skin tends to be a 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.360
 pinker shade a shade more orange or 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.760
 even people who have both 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.860
 the time or something so let's say they are from 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.410
 neutral tone that serve them the same 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 pink tones than orange tones 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.059
 I think it's pretty clear, 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.699
 how to find out done as if we are from 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.190
 one and another there are two techniques there are more than 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.170
 one but I will refer to two techniques 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.050
 one for example I have already collected 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.940
 you know a collection of beauty that is 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.880
 in that collection they came to me like two 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.880
 cardboard one in pink color or 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.780
 roses and a little baby pink and another with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.159
 an orange I do not know how they made orange 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.520
 intense strong orange 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.009
 so it was the book that I was 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.750
 I mean, if we approached 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.090
 natural light in this case I do not have the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.679
 natural then I can not you can not 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.520
 do that I have it for you but I'm going 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.710
 to say 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 good that orange and be more or less 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.490
 roses and rose medium half fox grace 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.790
 It's not a light pink either but it's not 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.770
 without roses and then I would put that 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
 Cardboard on the sides with natural light 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.700
 as I say for example here in the area 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.709
 is the face not in the in the jaw 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.080
 and then depending on when they gave you 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.360
 sunlight we know if you had better 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.010
 this west side was given a better 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.760
 aspect to the face that was of a tone or 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.970
 from another 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 for example if you have the tone in this the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.860
 non-pink habit not being skin 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.930
 for example, this is not what you think 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.780
 has to see as more luminous as 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.299
 less imperfections and prettier both 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.530
 that if we have for example orange then 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.600
 we have to find out with the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.920
 imperfections and nicer I by 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.630
 example I did the test of the two 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.250
 colors and align it came out that the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.580
 I have the cold sub tone and I already knew 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.980
 but I confirmed it good to all that 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.350
 as you know if we have if you have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.250
 a sub tone or another then very easy 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.890
 looking at our veins 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.360
 It's that simple if we see each other's veins 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.160
 with natural vale and veins tend to 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.800
 green means that we have so 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.680
 general a sub tone yellow a sub tone 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.709
 warm if we do not see the scene and we have 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.900
 a bluish or violet tone means that 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.880
 our sub tone is usually a 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.480
 tone 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.370
 pink is simply then like 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.840
 we know in a good neutral tone because 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.120
 the veins I do not know if it is going to be able 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.370
 know but you just know if you 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.910
 you put orange things and they feel you 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.920
 good and pink things that feel good 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.770
 just for example another one 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.110
 formula to know in quotes is yes 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.540
 you have better gold or silver because the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.430
 silver for cold tones a cold tone and 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.930
 for gold for the warm sub tone by 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.540
 example to me the silver to me I do not like 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.100
 I do not feel good and I do not like gold 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.890
 sorry I do not know if the silver said 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.360
 to me the achievement for example I do not like to 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.950
 I like silver more because it gives 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.750
 the coincidence that why it highlights me more 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.880
 my skin and I like it more in the aspect that 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.330
 It gives me but because I like silver more 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.360
 and gold because the skin is more pomegranates or 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.570
 darker skins more 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.780
 It's an orange and tan with him 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.820
 Gold comes better and simply good 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.140
 As you can see, it's very super short what 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.290
 I wanted to make it clear I hope that I have 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.760
 You served your skin tone 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.500
 you have after saying what I have 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.760
 said you leave it to me here below porfa 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.900
 come then see you in the next 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.900
 video see you later
