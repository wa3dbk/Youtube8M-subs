00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
welcome to the anno 1404 harbor system

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.520 
welcome to the anno 1404 harbor system
tutorial<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:08.210> this<00:00:09.210> last<00:00:09.599> tutorial<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.290> will

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
tutorial in this last tutorial we will

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.230 
tutorial in this last tutorial we will
have<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> closer<00:00:11.219> look<00:00:11.550> at<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.849> option<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
have a closer look at the option to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.480 
have a closer look at the option to
build<00:00:12.540> your<00:00:12.750> very<00:00:12.960> own<00:00:13.110> individual<00:00:14.099> harbors

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
build your very own individual harbors

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.880 
build your very own individual harbors
in<00:00:14.700> order<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.210> optimize<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.080> expand<00:00:16.710> your

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
in order to optimize and expand your

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.460 
in order to optimize and expand your
trade<00:00:17.160> routes<00:00:17.600> but<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:18.779> makes<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.230> different

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
trade routes but what makes it different

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.509 
trade routes but what makes it different
from<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.980> no<00:00:20.039> 1701<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.650> comparable<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
from a no 1701 is it comparable to the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.720 
from a no 1701 is it comparable to the
palace<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> prequel<00:00:25.039> we<00:00:26.039> asked<00:00:26.250> Dirk

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
palace in the prequel we asked Dirk

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.779 
palace in the prequel we asked Dirk
regard<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:28.380> ship<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> most<00:00:29.220> important

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
regard the ship is the most important

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.680 
regard the ship is the most important
units<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.660> n.o<00:00:30.810> game<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.850> time<00:00:32.880> we

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
units in the n.o game so this time we

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.160 
units in the n.o game so this time we
introduced<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.739> harbor<00:00:35.070> system<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.640> game

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
introduced the harbor system to the game

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.540 
introduced the harbor system to the game
to<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> connection<00:00:37.860> between<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
to make a connection between the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
to make a connection between the
settlement<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> player<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> ships

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
settlement of the player and the ships

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.610 
settlement of the player and the ships
so<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> harbor<00:00:41.969> system<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.930> player<00:00:43.170> can

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
so with the harbor system the player can

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
so with the harbor system the player can
build<00:00:44.160> large<00:00:45.289> storage<00:00:46.289> houses<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.180> build

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
build large storage houses he can build

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.110 
build large storage houses he can build
a<00:00:48.719> defense<00:00:49.079> towers<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.670> build<00:00:50.820> dogs

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a defense towers and he can build dogs

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.170 
a defense towers and he can build dogs
for<00:00:51.570> his<00:00:51.690> ships<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> trading<00:00:52.800> routes<00:00:53.180> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
for his ships for the trading routes so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.670 
for his ships for the trading routes so
there's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> stuff<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
there's a lot of stuff to do for the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.189

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
player and he can individualize his

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.119 
player and he can individualize his
Harbor<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.550> his<00:00:59.699> needs<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.390> built<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.680> really

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
individual in uh no 1404 with a very

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.960 
individual in uh no 1404 with a very
flexible<00:01:27.840> customizable<00:01:28.439> harbor<00:01:29.280> system<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
flexible customizable harbor system that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
flexible customizable harbor system that
makes<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> purpose<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> player

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
makes a lot of purpose for the player

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
makes a lot of purpose for the player
because<00:01:32.070> harbors<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.030> very<00:01:33.150> important<00:01:33.659> for

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
because harbors are very important for

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
because harbors are very important for
the<00:01:33.869> game<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.259> each<00:01:34.409> Island<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> looking

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the game in each Island is looking

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
the game in each Island is looking
different<00:01:35.549> each<00:01:36.119> player's<00:01:36.509> playing

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
different each player's playing

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
different each player's playing
differently<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.400> want<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> make

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
differently so if you want to make

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.120 
differently so if you want to make
combat<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.479> create<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.439> different<00:01:40.680> ABBA

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
combat you would create a different ABBA

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.520 
combat you would create a different ABBA
then<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> want<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> trade<00:01:42.840> man<00:01:43.140> with

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
then if you want to be a trade man with

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889 
then if you want to be a trade man with
a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.860> need<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.610> warehouses<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.420> storage

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
a lot of need for warehouses and storage

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
a lot of need for warehouses and storage
for<00:01:46.140> example<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> also<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> end<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> have

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
for example and also in the end you have

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
for example and also in the end you have
a<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.689> unique<00:01:49.079> Island<00:01:51.380> hopefully<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.740> were
