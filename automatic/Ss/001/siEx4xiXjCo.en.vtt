the technology inside now we won't know
how<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.180> fared<00:00:30.450> until<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.780> get<00:00:30.930> him<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.110> our

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
how that fared until we get him in our

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.310 
how that fared until we get him in our
proper<00:00:31.530> comparative<00:00:32.129> tests<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.600> paper<00:00:33.989> it

their noise reduction technology now

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.500 
their noise reduction technology now
last<00:00:38.579> year<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.850> thought<00:00:38.999> the<00:00:39.089> noise<00:00:39.239> reduction

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
last year we thought the noise reduction

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.869 
last year we thought the noise reduction
was<00:00:39.839> fantastic<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.710> samsung<00:00:41.249> so<00:00:41.429> we<00:00:41.550> interests

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
was fantastic on samsung so we interests

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.329 
was fantastic on samsung so we interests
to<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.089> how<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.269> can<00:00:42.539> make<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> any<00:00:43.019> better

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
to see how we can make that any better

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
technology to the series a that means

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.959 
technology to the series a that means
hopefully<00:00:49.199> better<00:00:49.530> contrast<00:00:50.159> deeper<00:00:50.699> blacks

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
hopefully better contrast deeper blacks
