00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.180
 with the race today I'm going to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 teach to use the give it a clean 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.800
 the headlights for that will need to sand 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:34.989
 1200 will need a pound 1500 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.989
 they are going to use a sandpaper 2000 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:43.470
 enough to polish to establish 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.760
 any wax a lot of water 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.760
 and a folio 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.739
 very well we pray step number 1 what 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.250
 they have to use in their league of 120 and 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.950
 it is much more coarse sandpaper 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.940
 Water 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.940
 they fill everything 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.290
 and to work 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.100
 very well this was after him 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.540
 in the first league choose the 120 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.700
 see as everything else he 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.140
 all the tartar and everything first the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.290
 first figures that you have there are always 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.060
 that use the thickest sandpaper 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.620
 principle my idea and we will use 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.620
 increasingly thin sandpaper 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.689
 Step 2 use and with 1200 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.190
 his daughter of 200 of course takes away the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.200
 the biggest scratches that we get 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.080
 I had just done the razor the sandpaper 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.470
 previous the sandpaper of 120 we are going to change 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.470
 of sandpaper 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 1500 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.109
 and a lot 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 we have 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.900
 very well then this is the finish with your 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.349
 daughter of 1500 of course is already going 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.540
 seeing still much clearer and its its 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.540
 lighthouse and let's change sandpaper 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.240
 very well now comes the sandpaper of 2000 already 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.240
 we are in step number 4 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.280
 again bits of water 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.110
 and to give 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.230
 you can almost see the whole lighthouse already 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 cleaned but let's go to the last step 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.150
 although this intermediate step is for 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.370
 remove all the moisture that you have in your 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.440
 lighthouse and especially because the wax what 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.440
 you need is to be completely dry 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.170
 very well what they have to do is 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.750
 grabbing a little bit of auction will be 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.299
 polisher what they will use in my 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.120
 case this is this wax can use 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.799
 a polisher if they want before and then already 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.690
 They use the wax as the final finish but 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.690
 Well, I 'm going to use 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.980
 very well
