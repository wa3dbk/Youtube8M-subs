OEM<00:00:04.090> intake<00:00:04.390> systems<00:00:05.200> typically<00:00:05.590> are

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 
OEM intake systems typically are

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.310 
OEM intake systems typically are
inefficient<00:00:06.250> because<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.629> manufacturers

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
inefficient because the manufacturers

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.990 
inefficient because the manufacturers
have<00:00:08.530> different<00:00:08.920> set<00:00:09.100> of<00:00:09.190> requirements<00:00:09.309> that

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
have different set of requirements that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.330 
have different set of requirements that
they've<00:00:10.180> got<00:00:10.389> to<00:00:10.570> meet<00:00:10.719> they<00:00:10.929> have<00:00:11.139> nvh<00:00:12.130> which

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
they've got to meet they have nvh which

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.370 
they've got to meet they have nvh which
is<00:00:12.490> noise<00:00:12.849> vibration<00:00:13.570> and<00:00:13.660> harshness<00:00:13.750> that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
is noise vibration and harshness that

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
is noise vibration and harshness that
they've<00:00:14.559> got<00:00:14.710> to<00:00:14.860> meet<00:00:15.040> and<00:00:15.219> they<00:00:15.639> have

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
they've got to meet and they have

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.089 
they've got to meet and they have
restriction<00:00:16.960> and<00:00:17.110> air<00:00:17.320> filter<00:00:17.500> because<00:00:17.770> they

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
restriction and air filter because they

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.730 
restriction and air filter because they
have<00:00:18.220> very<00:00:18.460> high<00:00:18.520> air<00:00:19.390> filtration<00:00:19.740> standards

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740

have to baseline a vehicle and when we

have to baseline a vehicle and when we
do<00:00:29.859> dyno<00:00:30.130> testing<00:00:30.670> we<00:00:30.880> don't<00:00:31.000> bring<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.810> car<00:00:32.080> in

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
do dyno testing we don't bring a car in

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.219 
do dyno testing we don't bring a car in
and<00:00:32.500> do<00:00:32.980> one<00:00:33.280> test<00:00:33.580> and<00:00:33.790> call<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.180> good<00:00:34.210> will<00:00:35.049> do

and do one test and call it good will do

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.770 
and do one test and call it good will do
several<00:00:35.559> dyno<00:00:35.979> test<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.610> establish<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.420> good

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
several dyno test and establish a good

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.140 
several dyno test and establish a good
stable<00:00:38.260> baseline<00:00:38.830> so<00:00:39.159> that<00:00:39.309> when<00:00:39.879> you<00:00:39.970> see

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
stable baseline so that when you see

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.299 
stable baseline so that when you see
reported<00:00:40.690> power<00:00:40.900> figures<00:00:41.199> from<00:00:41.500> us<00:00:41.739> they're

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
reported power figures from us they're

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.000 
reported power figures from us they're
typically<00:00:42.790> conservative<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.830> usually<00:00:44.830> is

typically conservative and usually is

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.369 
typically conservative and usually is
because<00:00:45.879> it's<00:00:46.269> several<00:00:46.659> tests<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.199> we've

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
because it's several tests that we've

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.160 
because it's several tests that we've
averaged<00:00:47.920> over<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:49.479> make<00:00:49.809> sure<00:00:49.839> we<00:00:50.049> have<00:00:50.140> good

stable numbers after we do the baseline
testing<00:00:53.440> we<00:00:54.070> have<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.339> go<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.670> dyno<00:00:54.909> and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
testing we have to go to the dyno and

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.479

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
usable rpm range so for example most

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.510 
usable rpm range so for example most

nine<00:01:58.550> thousand<00:01:59.480> rpm<00:01:59.840> I'm<00:01:59.990> sure<00:02:00.140> there's<00:02:00.320> some

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
nine thousand rpm I'm sure there's some

nine thousand rpm I'm sure there's some

kind<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.060> snicker<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.480> say<00:02:02.690> they<00:02:02.840> do<00:02:02.900> but<00:02:03.200> most

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
kind of snicker and say they do but most

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.130 
kind of snicker and say they do but most
people<00:02:04.460> drive<00:02:04.790> from<00:02:05.390> stoplight<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:05.990> stoplight

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
people drive from stoplight to stoplight

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.320 
people drive from stoplight to stoplight
and<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:06.860> want<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.160> feel<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> performance<00:02:08.180> in

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and they want to feel the performance in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.480 
and they want to feel the performance in
the<00:02:08.420> seat<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.780> their<00:02:08.869> pants<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.070> tune<00:02:10.310> our

the seat of their pants so we tune our
