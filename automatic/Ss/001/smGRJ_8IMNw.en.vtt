00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.940
 Hey guys 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.899
 Do you want your smartphone to do this? 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 What is mine doing now what? 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.799
 fetch notification dreads 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.350
 when you receive a message and 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:57.460
 applications and use and everything else 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:03.219
 this is very simple and easy on your 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.530
 routed device from the export reminding 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:12.190
 all the links are there in the description of the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:15.880
 video of a sport that is what the box is 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.280
 very simple I just opened the graphite 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:28.209
 box from here in the screen setting and will 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:31.479
 the option that I just mark her and when 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:34.780
 you exit and it looks like an application there 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.950
 the notification LEDs started to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.160
 blink 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.310
 when you received a notification 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.220
 when you will see her she will be 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.640
 course lead to this is to 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.599

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.780
