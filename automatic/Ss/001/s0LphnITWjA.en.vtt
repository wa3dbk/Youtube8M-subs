00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.670 
items are pretty much a mystery at the
moment<00:03:55.750> no<00:03:55.900> one<00:03:55.930> really<00:03:56.230> knows<00:03:56.319> what<00:03:56.560> they're

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
moment no one really knows what they're

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.890 
moment no one really knows what they're
going<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.829> be<00:03:57.010> or<00:03:57.190> what<00:03:57.280> they<00:03:57.430> are<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.750> these

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
going to be or what they are but these

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.960 
going to be or what they are but these
are<00:03:59.049> items<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.380> target<00:03:59.950> has<00:04:00.100> put<00:04:00.489> into<00:04:00.670> their

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
are items that target has put into their

are items that target has put into their
number<00:04:01.239> system<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.230> we<00:04:02.260> should<00:04:02.470> expect<00:04:02.769> them

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
number system so we should expect them

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.470 
number system so we should expect them
in<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.190> future<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.639> probably<00:04:04.060> some<00:04:04.239> proper

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
naming in the future as we get closer to
