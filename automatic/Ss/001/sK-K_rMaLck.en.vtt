them and the better that they look for
me<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.989> think<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:54.739> about<00:02:55.010> not<00:02:55.310> giving

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
me so I think it's just about not giving

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.150 
me so I think it's just about not giving
up<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.090> continuing<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.019> try<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.440> method

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
