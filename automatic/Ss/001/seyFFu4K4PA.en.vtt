00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
try to do better in this one it's kind

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.160 
try to do better in this one it's kind
of<00:01:11.400> hard<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> talk<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.570> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> same

of hard to talk and do this at the same

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.100 
of hard to talk and do this at the same
time<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:15.330> let's<00:01:15.860> try<00:01:16.860> anyway<00:01:18.110> nice

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
time but let's try anyway nice

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.780 
time but let's try anyway nice
soundtrack<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> way

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.190 

so<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.880> may<00:01:29.180> have<00:01:29.270> noticed<00:01:29.690> that<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.930> have<00:01:30.080> to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
so you may have noticed that you have to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.330 
so you may have noticed that you have to
start<00:01:30.440> all<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.830> way<00:01:30.920> from<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.250> beginning

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
start all the way from the beginning

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.550 
start all the way from the beginning
when<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.000> crash<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:33.050> gets<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.380> little

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
when you crash that gets a little

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.010 
when you crash that gets a little
frustrating<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.520> annoying<00:01:34.729> however<00:01:35.540> there

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
frustrating and annoying however there

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.530 
frustrating and annoying however there
is<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.260> practice<00:01:37.010> mode<00:01:37.280> if<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.940> click<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.360> this

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
is a practice mode if you click on this

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.440 
is a practice mode if you click on this
that<00:01:38.810> will<00:01:38.900> create<00:01:39.170> checkpoints<00:01:40.100> near<00:01:40.970> where

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
that will create checkpoints near where

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.210 
that will create checkpoints near where
you<00:01:41.630> crash<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.380> way<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.590> don't<00:01:42.920> have<00:01:43.010> to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
you crash that way you don't have to

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.790 
you crash that way you don't have to
start<00:01:43.430> all<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.850> way<00:01:43.940> from<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.270> beginning<00:01:44.800> if

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
start all the way from the beginning if

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.999 
start all the way from the beginning if
you<00:01:45.979> crash<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.520> start<00:01:46.790> over<00:01:47.090> somewhere<00:01:48.080> near

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
you crash you start over somewhere near

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.650 
you crash you start over somewhere near
where<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.430> crash<00:01:51.880> let's<00:01:52.880> try<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.479> better

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
where you crash let's try to do better

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.499 
where you crash let's try to do better
in<00:01:53.900> this<00:01:54.050> stage<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.560> uh<00:01:54.650> okay<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.360> see

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
in this stage and uh okay so you see

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.450 
in this stage and uh okay so you see
that<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.869> crashed<00:01:57.380> over<00:01:57.770> there<00:01:58.040> now<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.280> don't

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
that I crashed over there now I don't

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.740 
that I crashed over there now I don't
have<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.880> start<00:01:59.119> all<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> way<00:01:59.509> from<00:01:59.660> the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
have to start all the way from the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.630 
have to start all the way from the
beginning<00:02:00.110> I'm<00:02:00.229> starting<00:02:00.770> over<00:02:00.860> from<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
beginning I'm starting over from the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.359 
beginning I'm starting over from the
nearest<00:02:02.000> checkpoint<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:03.380> gonna<00:02:03.530> auto<00:02:03.830> retry

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
nearest checkpoint it's gonna auto retry

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.650 
nearest checkpoint it's gonna auto retry
unless<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.450> do<00:02:05.509> something<00:02:05.960> about<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.660> this

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
unless I do something about it so this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.890 
unless I do something about it so this
is<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.810> good<00:02:09.020> way<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.229> practice<00:02:10.630> memorize<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
is a good way to practice memorize the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.000 
is a good way to practice memorize the
stage<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:14.630> way<00:02:14.840> you'll<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.470> better<00:02:15.680> when

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
stage and that way you'll do better when

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.820 
stage and that way you'll do better when
