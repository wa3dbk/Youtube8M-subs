to<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.930> take<00:02:54.110> off<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.530> outer<00:02:54.739> leaves<00:02:55.070> of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
to just take off the outer leaves of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.920 
to just take off the outer leaves of

picked many times this lettuce I kind of

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.130 
picked many times this lettuce I kind of
go<00:03:03.950> underneath<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.450> I'm<00:03:05.570> pushing<00:03:05.810> down<00:03:06.110> on

go underneath and I'm pushing down on
its<00:03:06.500> outer<00:03:06.709> leaves<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.989> come<00:03:09.200> away<00:03:09.470> with<00:03:09.680> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
its outer leaves so come away with a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.830 
its outer leaves so come away with a
nice<00:03:10.579> selection<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.329> see<00:03:11.600> that<00:03:11.720> I've<00:03:11.810> got

the stem as well this is a multi stem
variety<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.430> put<00:03:16.880> these<00:03:17.030> leaves

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
variety and then I put these leaves

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.770 
variety and then I put these leaves
after<00:03:17.540> washing<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.200> my<00:03:18.829> salad<00:03:19.130> bag<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.880> then

side we picked only three days ago and
then<00:03:32.870> 11<00:03:33.290> days<00:03:33.410> ago<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.829> ones<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.280> other

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
then 11 days ago the ones on the other

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.250 
then 11 days ago the ones on the other
side<00:03:34.700> we've<00:03:34.880> picked<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.690> way<00:03:35.840> we<00:03:35.989> do<00:03:36.140> it

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
side we've picked and the way we do it

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.259 
side we've picked and the way we do it
is<00:03:36.410> very<00:03:36.440> simply<00:03:37.100> just<00:03:37.130> again<00:03:37.610> taking<00:03:38.000> off<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
is very simply just again taking off the

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.300 
is very simply just again taking off the
outer<00:03:38.390> leaves<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:38.959> there<00:03:39.620> are<00:03:39.739> many<00:03:39.950> here<00:03:40.160> but

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
outer leaves so there are many here but

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.789 
outer leaves so there are many here but
having<00:03:40.579> said<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:40.910> in<00:03:41.329> fact<00:03:41.620> there<00:03:42.620> are

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
having said that in fact there are

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.210 
having said that in fact there are
pretty<00:03:43.670> much<00:03:43.880> three<00:03:44.410> good<00:03:45.410> pickable<00:03:45.980> leaves

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
pretty much three good pickable leaves

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.699 
pretty much three good pickable leaves
on<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.150> plant<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:48.230> plant<00:03:48.350> is

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
on this plant and this plant is

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.990 
on this plant and this plant is
interesting<00:03:49.220> too<00:03:49.400> for<00:03:49.640> what's<00:03:49.760> growing

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
interesting too for what's growing

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.849 
interesting too for what's growing
underneath<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:50.660> which<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:51.109> mushrooms<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.769> you

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
underneath it which is mushrooms do you

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.319 
underneath it which is mushrooms do you
see<00:03:52.040> there's<00:03:52.250> some<00:03:52.430> lovely<00:03:52.640> mushrooms<00:03:53.120> there

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
see there's some lovely mushrooms there

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.690 
see there's some lovely mushrooms there
and<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> bonus<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.980> noda<00:03:55.370> growing

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
and this is a bonus of noda growing

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.050 
and this is a bonus of noda growing
because<00:03:56.150> healthy<00:03:57.140> undyed<00:03:57.590> soil<00:03:57.860> has<00:03:58.160> fungi<00:03:58.819> in

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
because healthy undyed soil has fungi in

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.440 
because healthy undyed soil has fungi in
and<00:03:59.739> most<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.010> fungi<00:04:01.340> are<00:04:01.519> not<00:04:01.849> edible<00:04:02.150> but

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
and most of the fungi are not edible but

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.690 
and most of the fungi are not edible but
this<00:04:03.349> is<00:04:03.530> actually<00:04:03.680> filled<00:04:04.129> mushroom<00:04:04.519> here

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
this is actually filled mushroom here

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.830 
this is actually filled mushroom here
you<00:04:04.910> can<00:04:05.090> see<00:04:05.830> if<00:04:06.830> I<00:04:07.099> cut<00:04:07.310> one<00:04:07.459> out<00:04:07.690> look<00:04:08.690> at

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
you can see if I cut one out look at

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.800 
you can see if I cut one out look at
that<00:04:09.019> it's<00:04:09.550> I'm<00:04:10.550> happy<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.120> eat<00:04:11.239> that<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.599> I

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
that it's I'm happy to eat that and I

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.180 
that it's I'm happy to eat that and I
know<00:04:12.050> they<00:04:12.260> say<00:04:12.440> because<00:04:12.560> I've<00:04:12.739> eaten<00:04:12.890> quite<00:04:13.129> a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
know they say because I've eaten quite a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.410 
know they say because I've eaten quite a
few<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.430> these<00:04:13.519> already<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.090> particular

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
few of these already of this particular

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.659 
few of these already of this particular
kind<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.769> just<00:04:15.890> illustrating<00:04:16.130> the

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
kind so this is just illustrating the

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.120 
kind so this is just illustrating the
point<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.090> really<00:04:17.510> healthy<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.349> axon<00:04:18.919> is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
point that a really healthy and axon is
