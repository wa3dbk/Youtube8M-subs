00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.039
 absolutely nothing am see life 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.050
 some of you know what song is that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.570
 and in the comments 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.610
 but it did not take me long to upload videos because 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 I would like it to be here where I live 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.329
 the days are super super cloudy and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 rainy and you that I love 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.390
 that the weather is like that or I like that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 it rains I like it to be cloudy 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.409
 I like it to be cold but programming is not 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.659
 it's kind of like the lighting is 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.070
 super mean hyper lousy and it's like that 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.829
 been every day I want to record 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.680
 I put the change and I'm not super dark 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.239
 then I could not record but this 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.979
 Once I decided that although it's still cloudy and it's 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.220
 to be cloudy all week according to the 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.960
 thing of the weather does not matter even though 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 the sun is against me may climb 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 video because it's been a long time since we 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 we see and the weather will not stop me to see if 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 our today's video is our 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 consciousness that can be super easy 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.710
 to do with with a toothbrush or 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.030
 toothbrush whatever you are told are 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.920
 the beauty tricks that works the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.570
 true super mega hyper good and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.299
 surely they must have already heard 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.909
 some of those because they are super tricks 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.440
 old are classic tricks but be like 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.390
 they are super work 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.790
 and I 'm trying this bad and the truth 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.320
 is that I love them and how is something very 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.550
 easy to get then they 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.420
 I highly recommend that you try them because 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.730
 the truth is that I think they're going to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.050
 love as much as me and yes I hope that 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.050
 like the video, let's see it 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.330
 and so 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.460
 the first beauty trick is the most 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400
 classic of all let's say it's a trick 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.630
 vintage what are we going to do these are 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.250
 our toothbrush for 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 exfoliate our lips and remove 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.200
 all the ugly little feet so they are 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.670
 super mega hyper soft what I like 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 to do for this is to use more flour 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.360
 with the brush and I just pass it 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 gently above my lips in 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.190
 mini circular movements this trick 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.370
 It works much better when I wet my 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.470
 lips with warm water before and we get 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.360
 soft lips without delay we almost nothing 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.739
 there are people that after you leave 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.930
 simple teeth to exfoliate your 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.610
 face as we are going to use a brush 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.800
 instead of an expo to use an exfoliant 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 it is better to use a common facial cleanser 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.519
 but as the skin of the face is very 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.470
 delicate I only recommend this method 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.989
 to exfoliate your nose well and not the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.180
 rest of the face also make sure that 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.769
 the diaz brush that is extra soft or 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.930
 use those that are for babies because they are 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.580
 more delicate my sister has already used 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.870
 this method says that he is super middle 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.980
 to love it but you have to do it with 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.080
 watch out 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.580
 a trick also classic but that I do not 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.230
 I'm going to try it so far these are 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.670
 a toothbrush to brush the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 eyebrows when you do not want to stay in your 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.690
 instead they can find a brush to 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.670
 eyebrows in stores or you can use a 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.920
 brush for mask but use a brush 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.379
 clean teeth also works super 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.030
 well just put a little gel or 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.260
 Vaseline on the brush and they go through 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.239
 above your eyebrows carefully 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.099
 What they can also do is use the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.159
 brush to exfoliate your knees elbows 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.739
 or heels it is very common to have dry skin 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.989
 or a little rougher in these areas in 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.370
 special when the weather is cold and if 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.150
 you have this problem alone 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.000
 they need two things 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.470
 thing number one is a moment in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
 this case I'm using one that smells 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.060
 super delicious to sweet and of course 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.980
 thing number 2 a toothbrush 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.980
 because that's what the video is about 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.480
 ok what I like to do is put something 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.100
 of cream first and then rub the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.080
 toothbrush above with much 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.370
 careful is the method that for me 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.770
 It works better but I would like to know 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.390
 for you what works for them 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.170
 better really gives me a lot 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.209
 curiosity know 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.150
 after exfoliating you just have to put 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.330
 more moisturizer on top have 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.180
 little cocks or little hairs in their hair 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.340
 no more than no solution 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.930
 if we spray the brush 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.109
 teeth and then we went through our 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.389
 hair dies and there will be no hair 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.669
 rebel minis 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.959
 Finally, especially if you are going to use a 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.210
 toothbrush for your face 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.219
 make sure it is super clean and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.139
 germ-free I just discovered that 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.999
 super father product to sterilize 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.069
 the brushes I use it also for the 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:32.050
 brush that I do use on my teeth and the 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.090
 it's true that I love it I'm going to upload a 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.810
 video soon about that because I loved it 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.810
 this product 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.789
 so I forgot to tell you how good 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.919
 that I remembered not going to use for 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.210
 none of these things the same brush 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.550
 they use to brush their teeth 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.840
 they get one apart I know that already 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.259
 they knew but I do not tell them that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.259
 caution 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.419
