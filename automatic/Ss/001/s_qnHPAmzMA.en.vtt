00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.500
 are the most technologically advanced mastiffs ever built 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.859
 They were designed to protect the feet 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.029
 to use their weapons with great precision 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.029
 and it is undetectable to the enemy 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.800
 suffern machines 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 falcioni sindicales 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.380
 its iron machines 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.380
 military aircrafts 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.550
 I was there for a month because it was obvious that one of the reasons 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 most amazing of the earth 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 the tanker planes 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.470
 male combat bomber to one another not mine one thousand 200 kilometers bombs 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 guided by laser air-to-air missiles 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.010
 telefe 117 for the first time of the so-called invisible styles 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.630
 can penetrate the dangerous enemy airspace and destroy centers 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.660
 vital communication and strategic airports 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.790
 the angled shape of the fuselage diverts the signals of the raval 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.210
 is covered in a paint that absorb radar signals and the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 heat of their engines can not be detected from the ground 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.690
 in the air base humanist of the squadron df 117 night hawks 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 the invisible telefe 117 technology is a combination of three things 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.070
 materials 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.700
 and tactics 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.770
 the function of invisible planes is to escape from enemy radars and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.850
 fool the systems that use the radar for it out 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.900
 the profile of a group that characterized the f 117 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.000
 is the characteristic of invisible planes that is more striking 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.539
 for most of us 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.199
 these angles deflect the signals that reach the beacon confuse the radar 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.199
 in January 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.310
 the plane is built with secret materials that contribute to 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.699
 make it invisible 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.699
 absorbs radar signals instead of reflecting 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.149
 ace 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.209
 is based on the combination of invisibility technologies and pumps 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.989
 Intelligent technologies allow pilots of these aircraft to reach the objective 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.249
 undetected 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.279
 throw your load destroy the target or return home with the assurance that 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.879
 they can not be attacked or detected from land lara payan cheers 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.569
 we saw in the storm of the desert we were able to reach all the objectives 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.949
 that we proposed guadalpÃ­n and a single plane suffered the slightest scratch 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.649
 the 717 its pilot bush by a group of aviators of 20 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.619
 using some of the most advanced computer systems that are 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.829
 know 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.529
 osorio 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.189
 when I saw the plane for the first time I thought the same thing that had taken the 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.149
 montaraz 3 to turn around 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:54.779
 lc 117 was designed to deflect any radar signal that reaches it 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.779
 and to absorb those that nothing is villa simpson 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.319
 in and adobe was in this culture 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.459
 The exhaust of the aircraft has also been designed to reduce the emission 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.079
 of heat and its infrared detection the gas output of the motors is 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.309
 extends along the back and is deflected upwards 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:15.149
 Another unusual feature of the plane is that it has moving parts in 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:18.249
 wing exit fences control both the angle of ascent and descent 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:21.180
 like the side tilt 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.280
 the barbecue computer decides the best at every moment 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.879
 flight plans are designed by complex computers to avoid 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.309
 dangers or radars of enemy missiles 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.309
 the data is loaded into the on-board computer which, if necessary, can be 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.309
 perform all broadcast without any help 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.240
 my first mission in the desert storm was to attack two centers of 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.180
 air defense control in western iraq so that the forces of the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.180
 coalition could pass and quickly the supremacy them 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.759
 most of the pilots we had confidence in the characteristics of the 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.149
 way and in which the plane could fulfill its mission but there was always the doubt 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.689
 he is never sure until the problems 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.789
 although sometimes 117 took two laser-guided bombs equipped with a 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.520
 system that provides the pilot with video image even during the night 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:52.520
 lc 117 is the most effective tactical attack aircraft in the history of war 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.550
 lc 117 is invisible 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.839
 but the cargo that can be transported is small
