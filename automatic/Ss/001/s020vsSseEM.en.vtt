00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:26.050
 hello well GTA5 staff once again right in 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.009
 putting there more eager to play 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.860
 no pc 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.120
 this time comparative some 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:40.470
 images comparing the three versions 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 is the game of gta ps3 gt a ps4 and gta pc 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.129
 remembering the ps3 version is practically 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.910
 identical to that of ps4 xbox 360 is 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.550
 practically identical to the version of xbox 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.320
 year then there are three generations the generation 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 past of the current generation consoles and pc 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.550
 okay, let's go to the comparative 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.259
 while showing the pictures to you I 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.679
 ok commenting will come on this 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:16.869
 first picture you can see that the 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:20.770
 the level of the weeds in the background and 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.229
 around this one 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.690
 I know very well I think it's a little house with 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.110
 a little something as soon as it is 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:34.869
 to the level of detail how is it that in the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:39.970
 ps3 is much funnier on ps 4 increases 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:42.670
 rather this is the right plantation and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.940
 in PC there is this increase of this plantation 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.340
 only put as picture quality 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.830
 much sharper 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.319
 the light effect much better 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.610
 improved right 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.509
 in the second image we see oo the car 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.319
 huh 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.539
 where you perceive a very sharpness 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.440
 higher on pc 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:12.870
 look at the wheel and the detail level of the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.450
 route is on ps 4 and has a level is more 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.819
 Improved lighting just not the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.569
 pc level where you have a reflex 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.269
 on the car's bodywork and the wheel has 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.550
 More details grandson is a lighting is 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:33.430
 but it's okay so 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.700
 adaly sure in the third image are you 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.070
 can see the level of detail with 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.830
 relation to texture 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.050
 note that the hand on ps3 gives it up to a 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.900
 pixel entering inside the other one of papaya 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.720
 with the other is where there are no details 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.160
 fix the gun upon those four 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.610
 dark streaks on the right already in ps 4're already 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.870
 but well detailed what it is for 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.660
 the trigger hole is that of the dog he 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.380
 gun is a hole in ps3 is just a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.620
 dark figure in the ps frame already has more 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.100
 detailed texture is better than 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.220
 that not ps3 but not pc 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.630
 Look at the difference, of course, the hand 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.300
 there's a glove there 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.120
 but notice the contour of the fingers as 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.390
 is much more rounded than the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.300
 ps version 4 and level of detail of 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.910
 weapon has greatly increased the soul in this 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.060
 It's black but it has much more detail. 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.110
 or registrants who also has the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.600
 4 feet version but it is much more 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.650
 accentuated even than the version of ps 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.910
 four and even more than the version of ps3 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.970
 a next image 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.360
 we have a much more open environment 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.410
 repair the sky as it is more detailed in the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:03.190
 pc version lawn level at the time 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:08.080
 How is it different? 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:11.350
 from ps3 to ps4 and even more for pc and 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.530
 more accentuated lighting also looks 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.010
 shadow is more detailed in the 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:22.870
 pc version and the amount of grass it 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:28.140
 It's much more perfect than the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.550
 of ps 4 and ds3 also in this other image 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.270
 notice the water 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.840
 the water effect on ps3 is more 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.110
 does not have a 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.590
 a detail is of water itself 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:48.630
 already in ps 4 improved a lot and evolving 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.750
 that smoke is referring to the thorns 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.080
 very similar effects. 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.460
 nor where it involves more environment occlusion 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.970
 né and already the pc version is stark 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.240
 water level detail difference 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.190
 is given to planting and especially 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.190
 lighting and textures used there 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:18.510
 sure the level of detail is much higher 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.510
 not in this version of pc where 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.840
 rockstar commented that he wants to 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.490
 final version of gta né with 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.880
 more details 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.110
 sometimes what is causing the 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.300
 game has been postponed yet again 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.110
 where I'm not particularly 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.160
 I'm so worried about the game being 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:49.740
 delayed but with the final quality 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.870
 I hope that with all is and is is this is these 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.260
 changes in dates 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.830
 we have a really stable game and 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.160
 with all this quality as we see 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.800
 in these images I've shown now is 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.220
 fear right people is there in the end 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.220
 we are afraid of the end result 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.919
 but the expectation is glaring I 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.030
 I particularly prefer that the game be 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.900
 postponed 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.590
 nor how it has been more than we have received 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.180
 a final quality equivalent to any 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.599
 this wait is not 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.750
 we can only wait to see 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:33.630
 in the end, how are you going to leave, okay? I do not know 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.940
 forget to subscribe to the channel leave 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.849
 its like installing the application to 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.639
 receive channel news in time 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.849
 Real that we now have several videos 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:47.430
 outside the usual second and fourth 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:49.790
 Friday at 8 o'clock at night 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.570
 Okay, so I'll wait for you 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.620
 be sure to leave the comment 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.350
 expectation of you 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.080
 The gt down here is a big hug. 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:04.040
 and until the next video 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:08.830
 Thank you for persisting between coffee 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.830
 This way,
