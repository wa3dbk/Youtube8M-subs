00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.050
 O 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.749
 the other 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.550
 the proposed text 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.180
 them by protests 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.850
 quote text hotsite text bucks text tce that demonstration 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.540
 just watched 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.990
 in practice 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.480
 a way to transform your thesis 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.940
 in a more sheen style marchi 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.110
 the margin of maneuver but the one developed by the narrative and students 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.159
 and you have 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.030
 of these 16 3 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.080
 in these periods you can record 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.410
 standards 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.680
 these patterns are not replicated and you also have a visual response 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.120
 it's a shame to see the box 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.850
 It's a good thing I figured out how to do it. 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.960
 when I was watching the last one 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.800
 It's a big deal, we work together with the Brazilian tribe project. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.610
 and by the law to do the work with mateus b that also is part of all Brazil 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.280
 they will give way to use 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 to apc 40 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.170
 with luck solved then suffered from vitiligo 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.090
 and not based on the play les I was there 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.250
 and there on each of these carnivals 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 given to weave 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.990
 she is 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.850
 in this different year 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.490
 so this 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.970
 I had this idea 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.470
 and you can pick up and use the expedition here so you can play sounds 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.400
 and you can play 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.990
 and what has to know what to differentiate 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.259
 and further the tightening here 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.839
 the sound comes out 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.819
 me too 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.979
 has been ravaging the minister Gilmar 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:17.379
 beginning to appear in the afternoon at home in sequences 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 so how did I do it? 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.959
 I have it here 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.549
 the channel 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.729
 with a shot in the foot 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:30.610
 it is a 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.519
 an electronic drum machine 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.279
 on active 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.339
 I can not take it anymore 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.819
 who here on the side 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.259
 that I really have in this system the adjustments 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.529
 stock 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.329
 that's what we have here 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.349
 information is entering here on my computer until you have a 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.149
 detail that I forgot to comment on the following 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.459
 so this can work 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.919
 You will need to come here with belongings. 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.509
 off 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.149
 the common pc told sue 6 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:06.289
 deny the collections of labyrinthitis and unfortunately I do not know how to use as 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.569
 told me just did 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.450
 there is a lot of marchinha 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.290
 at the same time but I believe there is information from you to do this 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.219
 how tight we are entering information miit 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.530
 I'm loving it 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.989
 here on the trumpet 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.200
 but next days really 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.570
 employees 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.109
 so I got it 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.689
 I created with eight media channels my power fights 8 lights 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.659
 and this media channel here 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.129
 helton doing it and getting like nation and chicken 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.109
 I came here from the side 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.249
 I opened the ptb that was not noticed that humiliated it 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.599
 and I told him this market is better 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.989
 by information limit dulko all own 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.639
 I wanted him and other places 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.129
 no texas poster 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.049
 this the first cearense team channel 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.989
 was another through 1 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.399
 at 40 atc 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:08.069
 the 2nd refis basically the same thing also I got information dismissed 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.919
 but now I'm sending this year 2 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.510
 and so on until you reach an eighth dressing room 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.189
 eighth car here 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.709
 but the club that way 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.080
 all 217 61 points person gets this allowance read the light looks like it goes 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.170
 running say 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.710
 from here to there 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.629
 and I came here 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.759
 on this button also on the side that button which is a pillar 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.569
 lost was here of the law 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.279
 so I put the little grandson a little late 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.009
 in each of them 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.710
 the first occurred although the alloy 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.210
 the second and tenth of a second later 20 40 50 60 70 and 80 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.479
 the SÃ£o Paulo did 3 to 1 statistically running his son of the land 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.529
 just remembering what to play here 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.999
 but I could also have for the parliamentary strand with several 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.259
 different effects 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.919
 - could and would return a fight that is high from here to calm down from above 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.030
 variations are 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.770
 almost in conflict 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.969
 and who can record the standards of what I do 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.870
 I could for example 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.870
 the boot to touch 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.839
 elsewhere in the campaign against crack and here 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.879
 I'm going to play 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.970
 that way they left the river exchange 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.680
 and I never spoke when I came to the work of coimbra the apparent plan in that case 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.680
 which ended up creating a spirit of 2/3 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.770
 were also in the mailbox 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.599
 I'd rather do it. 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:42.870
 beijing - then 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.500
 but also just double click here in the Brazilian space and gives the 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.500
 planned fight we reproduce that the boats 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.180
 note 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.180
 ok the peugeot the treatment 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.699
 He also fell time. 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.719
 I came here meditate 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.849
 travels with discounts and cherry I chose to extend to other relatives in 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.610
 July then it's centronic and straightening 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.750
 even if I touch 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.040
 out of time it will appear to have admitted representatives 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.830
 what are you listening 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.330
 the text 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.189
 the protests 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.819
 great protest the case the text the case the text 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.159
 the case 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.960
 this change I made with the crisis 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.330
 paranaense can do with any other controller you can do with 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.619
 she asked 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:36.990
 4 with the brand itself 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.410
 had little own name 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.450
 he is that 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.520
 it gives the power of you can really redraw things 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.969
 but the most interesting is also how to present yourself 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:49.099
 I think everything 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.520
 sure enough so very special impact the protest 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:59.270
 is one of the preferred destinations of the standards the third text basically 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.539
 the patient who was dancing in the rhythm of the songs of the 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.580
 standard that is growing on time 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.869
 the protest the text 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:10.919
 I'm getting the way I wanted 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.629
 unfortunately very common 8 yet three cycles are all people who already have 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:17.399
 this version 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.809
 now it can download 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.539
 modify and also create 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.949
 our own plan but even within the thesis 40
