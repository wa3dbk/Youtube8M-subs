whatever it is that you can stay steady

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.970 
whatever it is that you can stay steady
to<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.670> i'm<00:03:27.240> going<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.450> count<00:03:27.690> with<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.650> we're

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
to and i'm going to count with so we're

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
to and i'm going to count with so we're
going<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.160> go<00:03:29.280> one<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.240> two<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.640> keep<00:03:32.640> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
going to go one and two and keep it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:52.699 
going to go one and two and keep it
steady<00:03:34.459> one<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:51.600> being<00:03:51.959> steady<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
steady one and so being steady with the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.470 
steady one and so being steady with the
thing<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.010> words<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.489> most<00:03:53.850> importantly

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
thing is words that most importantly

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.120 
thing is words that most importantly
because<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:55.260> can<00:03:55.410> play<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.590> bunch<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.980> notes

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
because you can play a bunch of notes

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.770 
because you can play a bunch of notes
and<00:03:56.370> if<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:56.580> not<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.940> any<00:03:57.120> kind<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.570> good

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
and if it's not in any kind of a good

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.050 
and if it's not in any kind of a good
rhythm<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.680> will<00:03:58.980> you'll<00:03:59.400> kind<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.670> get<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.850> feel

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
rhythm it will you'll kind of get a feel

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.790 
rhythm it will you'll kind of get a feel
for<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.330> later<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.080> it's<00:04:01.590> not

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
for that later on then it's it's not

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.259 
for that later on then it's it's not
going<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.040> sound<00:04:02.190> very<00:04:02.340> good<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.670> anybody's

much like music as it what if it was in
rhythm<00:04:10.049> okay<00:04:10.230> anyways<00:04:11.160> that's<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.940> minor

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
rhythm okay anyways that's the a minor

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.960 
rhythm okay anyways that's the a minor
pentatonic<00:04:13.670> scale<00:04:14.670> just<00:04:15.150> up<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.630> down<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.080> go

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.570 

you<00:04:20.970> can<00:04:21.150> use<00:04:21.300> all<00:04:21.510> down<00:04:21.780> strokes<00:04:21.990> for<00:04:22.380> now

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
you can use all down strokes for now

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.190 
you can use all down strokes for now
which<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.730> fine<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.420> eventually<00:04:24.750> I'm<00:04:25.080> going

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
which is fine but eventually I'm going

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.680 
which is fine but eventually I'm going
to<00:04:25.290> have<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.440> doing<00:04:25.860> alternate<00:04:26.400> picking<00:04:26.690> up

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690

all down strokes is just fine now at the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.790 
all down strokes is just fine now at the
next<00:04:36.240> lesson<00:04:36.450> we're<00:04:36.960> going<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.140> create<00:04:37.410> some

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
next lesson we're going to create some

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.190 
next lesson we're going to create some
small<00:04:38.190> soloing<00:04:38.820> ideas<00:04:39.270> built<00:04:39.660> off<00:04:39.900> of<00:04:39.930> this

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
small soloing ideas built off of this

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.570 
small soloing ideas built off of this
scale<00:04:40.440> pattern<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:40.950> stick<00:04:41.130> around<00:04:41.160> for<00:04:41.550> that

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
scale pattern so stick around for that

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.450 
scale pattern so stick around for that
see<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.270> then
