00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.600 

first<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.340> all<00:00:08.430> I<00:00:08.490> think<00:00:08.790> getting<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
first of all I think getting the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.730 
first of all I think getting the
is<00:00:10.969> you<00:00:11.929> know<00:00:11.960> it's<00:00:12.139> earth-shattering<00:00:12.650> it

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
is you know it's earth-shattering it

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.990 
is you know it's earth-shattering it
turns<00:00:12.920> your<00:00:13.070> world<00:00:13.099> upside<00:00:13.370> down<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:13.789> then

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
turns your world upside down and then

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.170 
turns your world upside down and then
you<00:00:14.090> hear<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:14.299> word<00:00:14.509> brain<00:00:15.199> tumor<00:00:16.029> but<00:00:17.029> what<00:00:17.150> I

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
you hear the word brain tumor but what I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.429 
you hear the word brain tumor but what I
think<00:00:17.420> patients<00:00:17.570> need<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.960> understand<00:00:18.320> is

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
think patients need to understand is

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.380 
think patients need to understand is
that<00:00:18.590> there's<00:00:18.770> really<00:00:18.950> a<00:00:19.250> wide<00:00:19.580> variety<00:00:20.090> of

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
that there's really a wide variety of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.290 
that there's really a wide variety of
tumors<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.310> today<00:00:22.310> with<00:00:22.640> all<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.910> tools<00:00:23.060> we

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
tumors and today with all the tools we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.689 
tumors and today with all the tools we
have<00:00:23.439> advances<00:00:24.439> in<00:00:24.560> surgical<00:00:24.740> resection<00:00:25.310> and

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
have advances in surgical resection and

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.150 
have advances in surgical resection and
advances<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.689> non-invasive<00:00:27.259> ways<00:00:27.770> of<00:00:27.950> treating

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
advances a non-invasive ways of treating

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.370 
advances a non-invasive ways of treating
these<00:00:28.250> tumors<00:00:28.579> like<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.910> CyberKnife<00:00:29.380> it

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
these tumors like the CyberKnife it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.260 
these tumors like the CyberKnife it
doesn't<00:00:30.829> always<00:00:31.040> mean<00:00:31.340> a<00:00:31.399> dismal<00:00:31.759> outcome<00:00:32.149> in

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
doesn't always mean a dismal outcome in

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.810 
doesn't always mean a dismal outcome in
fact<00:00:32.980> for<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.040> vast<00:00:34.219> majority<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.670> these

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
fact for the vast majority of these

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.670 
fact for the vast majority of these
tumors<00:00:35.239> we<00:00:35.629> actually<00:00:36.140> have<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.290> very<00:00:36.500> high

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
tumors we actually have a very high

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
tumors we actually have a very high
degree<00:00:36.890> of<00:00:37.070> success

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.970 

the<00:00:42.300> broad<00:00:42.720> category<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> treatment<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the broad category of the treatment is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
the broad category of the treatment is
called<00:00:44.250> stereotactic<00:00:45.210> radiosurgery<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
called stereotactic radiosurgery and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.280 
called stereotactic radiosurgery and
what<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.860> means<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.670> are

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
what that really means is that we are

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.229 
what that really means is that we are
pinpointing<00:00:49.290> radiation<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.400> body<00:00:50.610> with

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
pinpointing radiation in the body with

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.299 
pinpointing radiation in the body with
submillimeter<00:00:51.690> accuracy<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.650> a<00:00:52.680> target<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
submillimeter accuracy at a target and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 
submillimeter accuracy at a target and
that<00:00:53.850> target<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> usually<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.540> tumor<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.020> could

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that target is usually a tumor it could

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.360 
that target is usually a tumor it could
be<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> malignant<00:00:55.710> tumor<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> benign<00:00:56.340> tumor

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
be a malignant tumor a benign tumor

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.280 
be a malignant tumor a benign tumor
actually<00:00:56.910> sometimes<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.720> not<00:00:57.839> even<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.050> tumor

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
actually sometimes it's not even a tumor

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually sometimes it's not even a tumor
at<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.620> treat<00:00:58.860> things<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.430> non

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
at all we treat things that are non

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.689 
at all we treat things that are non
malignant<00:01:00.449> altogether<00:01:01.190> but<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.489> key

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
malignant altogether but but the key

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
malignant altogether but but the key
thing<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.269> that<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
thing here is that we need to get the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
thing here is that we need to get the
radiation<00:01:05.009> only<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.850> our<00:01:06.000> target<00:01:06.270> tissue<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
radiation only to our target tissue and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
radiation only to our target tissue and
avoid<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> normal<00:01:08.070> tissue<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.460> that's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
avoid all the normal tissue so that's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
avoid all the normal tissue so that's
what<00:01:08.790> stereotactic<00:01:09.240> radiosurgery<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
what stereotactic radiosurgery is it's

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.930 
what stereotactic radiosurgery is it's
been<00:01:10.920> around<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> long<00:01:11.550> time<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> was

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
been around for a long time it was

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.570 
been around for a long time it was
actually<00:01:12.150> invented<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> 60s<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
actually invented in the 60s on a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.130 
actually invented in the 60s on a
machine<00:01:14.910> called<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> gamma<00:01:15.450> knife<00:01:15.570> by<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
machine called the gamma knife by a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
machine called the gamma knife by a
Swedish<00:01:16.560> neurosurgeon<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.729> machine

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Swedish neurosurgeon and that machine

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.389 
Swedish neurosurgeon and that machine
still<00:01:18.300> around<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.039> advances<00:01:20.039> have<00:01:20.160> occurred

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
still around but advances have occurred

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.520 
still around but advances have occurred
obviously<00:01:20.880> since<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> 60s<00:01:21.660> and<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.500> have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
obviously since the 60s and we now have

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.279 
obviously since the 60s and we now have
robots<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.729> deliver<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.750> therapy<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
robots that deliver this therapy in a

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.950 
robots that deliver this therapy in a
completely<00:01:25.920> non-invasive<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
completely non-invasive way and that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.480 
completely non-invasive way and that
machine<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.280> at<00:01:29.369> El

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
machine is what we here have here at El

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.830 
machine is what we here have here at El
Camino<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.149> called<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> CyberKnife

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.480 

CyberKnife<00:01:35.259> is<00:01:35.320> it's<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:36.070> really<00:01:36.340> a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
CyberKnife is it's it's really a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.749 
CyberKnife is it's it's really a
miraculous<00:01:37.420> advance<00:01:38.159> patients<00:01:39.159> can<00:01:39.280> walk<00:01:39.520> in

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
miraculous advance patients can walk in

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.859 
miraculous advance patients can walk in
in<00:01:40.000> their<00:01:40.149> street<00:01:40.450> clothes

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
in their street clothes

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.690 
in their street clothes
it<00:01:40.960> doesn't<00:01:41.229> require<00:01:41.320> any<00:01:41.500> anesthesia<00:01:42.039> it's

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
it doesn't require any anesthesia it's

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.630 
it doesn't require any anesthesia it's
completely<00:01:43.270> non-invasive<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:45.340> are

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
completely non-invasive they are

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.219 
completely non-invasive they are
literally<00:01:46.000> laying<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.600> table<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.109> they

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
literally laying on a table and they

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.130 
literally laying on a table and they
don't<00:01:47.380> feel<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.679> thing<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.450> radiation<00:01:50.020> is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
don't feel a thing the radiation is

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.380 
don't feel a thing the radiation is
delivered<00:01:50.590> via<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:51.039> robot<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:52.179> has<00:01:52.360> a

the room that actually monitor the
patient<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.079> monitor<00:01:59.829> where<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.429> tumor<00:02:00.729> is

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
patient and monitor where the tumor is

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.240 
patient and monitor where the tumor is
at<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:01.179> times<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.319> this<00:02:02.500> robot<00:02:02.799> is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
at all times so this robot is

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.069 
at all times so this robot is
continuously<00:02:04.030> watching<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.630> tumor<00:02:04.929> and

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
continuously watching the tumor and

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.870 
continuously watching the tumor and
treating<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.920> tumor<00:02:06.189> from<00:02:06.340> hundreds<00:02:06.789> of

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
treating the tumor from hundreds of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.270 
treating the tumor from hundreds of
different<00:02:07.000> angles<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:07.689> as<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.739> patient<00:02:09.039> you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
different angles so as a patient you

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.339 
different angles so as a patient you
walk<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.970> lay<00:02:10.119> down<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.929> won't<00:02:11.110> feel<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
walk in you lay down you won't feel a

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.319 
walk in you lay down you won't feel a
thing<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.099> can<00:02:12.250> literally<00:02:12.519> walk<00:02:13.000> out<00:02:13.180> of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
thing and you can literally walk out of

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.620 
thing and you can literally walk out of
here

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.630 

there<00:02:17.230> are<00:02:17.530> some<00:02:17.890> brain<00:02:18.100> tumors<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.520> are

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
there are some brain tumors that are

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.310 
there are some brain tumors that are
still<00:02:18.910> quite<00:02:19.150> malignant<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.810> again<00:02:20.140> we've

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
still quite malignant but again we've

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.440 
still quite malignant but again we've
made<00:02:20.530> advances<00:02:21.040> in<00:02:21.160> those<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.820> outcomes<00:02:22.330> are

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
made advances in those and outcomes are

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.930 
made advances in those and outcomes are
getting<00:02:22.690> better<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.050> better<00:02:23.310> however<00:02:24.310> many

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
getting better and better however many

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.660 
getting better and better however many
brain<00:02:25.300> tumors<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.770> very<00:02:27.190> very<00:02:27.490> high

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
brain tumors have a very very high

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.150 
brain tumors have a very very high
degree<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:27.970> success<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.780> CyberKnife

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
degree of success with the CyberKnife

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.560 
degree of success with the CyberKnife
where<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.430> control<00:02:30.760> rates<00:02:31.000> better<00:02:31.360> than

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
where we have control rates better than

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.050 
where we have control rates better than
90%<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.290> some<00:02:32.470> instances<00:02:32.920> 95%<00:02:33.790> are<00:02:33.880> better

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.180 
90% in some instances 95% are better
controlling<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:34.990> tumors<00:02:35.320> for<00:02:35.680> good

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.550 

once<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.970> hear<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.540> word<00:02:40.720> brain<00:02:41.080> tumor<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
once you hear the word brain tumor the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.580 
once you hear the word brain tumor the
first<00:02:41.830> thing<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.100> do<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.340> not<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.790> panic<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
first thing to do is not to panic and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.080 
first thing to do is not to panic and
the<00:02:44.590> next<00:02:44.860> thing<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.160> do<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.790> get<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.060> a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
the next thing to do is to get to a

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.540 
the next thing to do is to get to a
center<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.690> El<00:02:46.870> Camino<00:02:47.230> Hospital<00:02:47.430> where<00:02:48.430> we

Camino we meet in a multidisciplinary
approach<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:58.000> means<00:02:58.380> neurosurgeons

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
approach that means neurosurgeons

get<00:03:04.090> together<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.660> review<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.440> case<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.950> we

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
get together and review the case and we

get together and review the case and we
put<00:03:06.700> our<00:03:06.790> heads<00:03:06.940> together<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.330> decide<00:03:07.540> what

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
put our heads together and decide what

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.570 
put our heads together and decide what
is<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.500> best<00:03:08.800> way<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> going<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.490> be

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
is the best way is it going to be

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.160 
is the best way is it going to be
surgery<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.240> going<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.420> be<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.630> CyberKnife

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
surgery is it going to be the CyberKnife

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.810 
surgery is it going to be the CyberKnife
is<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.710> going<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.890> be<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:11.980> combination<00:03:12.640> and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
is it going to be a combination and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.150 
is it going to be a combination and
that's<00:03:13.510> really<00:03:13.750> how<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.050> optimize<00:03:14.410> outcomes

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
that's really how you optimize outcomes

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:24.059 
that's really how you optimize outcomes
for<00:03:15.580> patients

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069
