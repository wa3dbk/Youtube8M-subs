be important if we enter through the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.800 
be important if we enter through the
door<00:04:50.770> instead<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.370> wall<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.789> now<00:04:52.750> you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
door instead of the wall and now you

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.689 
door instead of the wall and now you
will<00:04:53.050> see<00:04:53.320> why<00:04:54.990> because<00:04:58.979> if<00:04:59.979> it<00:05:00.280> hurries<00:05:00.580> up

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.469 
will see why because if it hurries up
for<00:05:00.910> frying<00:05:01.120> yes<00:05:01.539> here<00:05:01.900> we<00:05:01.930> go<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:03.400> door<00:05:03.639> okay

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
for frying yes here we go the door okay

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.480 
for frying yes here we go the door okay

cartridge done got some other points for
that<00:07:23.500> and<00:07:23.850> I<00:07:24.850> think<00:07:24.970> I<00:07:25.210> might<00:07:25.389> say<00:07:25.630> that<00:07:27.450> got

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
that and I think I might say that got

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:41.610 
that and I think I might say that got
key<00:07:29.470> card<00:07:30.240> and<00:07:31.650> cut<00:07:33.539> Ridge<00:07:37.890> yes<00:07:38.890> I<00:07:40.530> don't<00:07:41.530> know

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620

and<00:07:41.860> now<00:07:42.520> I<00:07:42.760> think<00:07:43.090> I<00:07:43.180> might<00:07:43.330> have<00:07:43.360> to<00:07:43.510> call<00:07:44.320> it

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.470 
and now I think I might have to call it

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.980 
and now I think I might have to call it
quits<00:07:44.530> because<00:07:44.890> my<00:07:45.760> 10<00:07:46.300> minute<00:07:46.390> limit<00:07:46.660> is<00:07:46.840> all
