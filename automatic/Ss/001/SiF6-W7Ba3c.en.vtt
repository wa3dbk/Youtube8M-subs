00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.470
 aim a loop and beastly lie 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.150
 card game for two to ten players 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.210
 from 6 years old

 handed out to the players 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 the players take one or more turns in turn 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 cards with the same value are on the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 discard pile and call which card it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 be the first one is played 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.759
 then I have to follow two, then the three 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.649
 and so on that order is mandatory 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
 if you don't have the right cards 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 you play the other cards 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.370
 But you say you have the right cards 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 explains that is called bluffing when caught 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.710
 is bluffing 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 You must remove all cards from the discard pile 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.809
 who first loses his cards 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.590
 is who wins the game 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.180
 content of the game the 55 playing cards 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.640
 there is one on each playing card 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.620
 farm animals from every animal are there 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 five cards and each animal has one 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 own values 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.860
 the bigger it here the higher the value 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.770
 the dogs are special cards it says 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.990
 no value on and the rules of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 boerenburg 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.040
 all the cards are prepared 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.229
 handed out to the players 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.759
 players may have one more card 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.540
 then get others 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.340
 that is not a disadvantage the game starts the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.070
 player with the dog with the golden book 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 starts and throws only this card on that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.869
 card is the start of a discard pile 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.939
 A turn involves throwing one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.490
 or more cards with the image to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.310
 down on the discard pile where you put the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 value and the number thereof calls the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.750
 first player starts with the dog with it 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.329
 golden bone the second player 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.820
 throws one the next player in the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.470
 two and so on 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.200
 for example, the second player places three 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.329
 cards more and calls three ones 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 once you're in the tens throws 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.430
 the next player that one and then 2 again 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 and so on and so forth 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 because the card is discarded and covered 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 do not have to do what you call 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.800
 if it's your turn to get away 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.420
 You can actually throw any card or 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.570
 combination of cards 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.690
 for example you call two and four 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.790
 became a 3 and 1 2 off that I bluff 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.400
 and of course you have to with a steel 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.140
 face if you have a complete set of 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 have a number five 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.310
 you can open the exact same cards 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.810
 put it on the table in a pile 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.090
 you do not have the requested number 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.810
 to play but after this it is your turn 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.420
 passed 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.640
 you can play five per turn 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 put the five dollars on the table that you have 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.600
 numbers 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.820
 and they rise in height every player 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.280
 who suspects the card and who by 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.380
 player thrown away do not match 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.459
 with the called value that person can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.980
 to challenge 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.600
 by calling bluff then the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.209
 cards played by the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.100
 challenged the player to open and can 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.709
 one of the following two things happen 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.110
 if the cards all have the value 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.019
 who was called the challenge is false 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.110
 the bone beats the player's challenge 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.209
 happily nods like a horse 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.150
 and the challenger must discard entire pile 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.010
 tackle as one or more of the played 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.620
 cards deviates from the called value 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.570
 is the challenge right there is bluffing 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.380
 the player who bluffed 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.600
 howls like a cow and has to 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.340
 travels across state address 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.230
 the player who places the discard pile on one 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.540
 Cap decrease the turn 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.730
 he mentions the next value and it 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.170
 number if a bluff was called at bot 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.580
 3 sixes 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.549
 continue the next play with 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.230
 sevens and plays the card from the dogs 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.730
 are special cards 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.980
 they have no value there are two 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.110
 species of namely trotting london and 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.510
 false below 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.790
 there is a good dog with the golden one 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.310
 blunt and that is the starting card 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.350
 we good dogs count as joker and art 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.690
 you use for every value 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.860
 fake dogs nobody wants that 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.990
 gotta get rid of it 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.750
 but if you play fake dog bluff 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.110
 you always when they play that calls you 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.820
 bluffs 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.950
 and you played a fake dog 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.480
 caught one and you have to take it 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.460
 record 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.560
 end of the game and the winner the 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.540
 player who first all his cards 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.080
 is the winner 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.080
