00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.710
 policy 7 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
 nice 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.550
 10 am heene 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.550
 policy 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.669
 I am by the club 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 I am more typed 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.770
 so sunny colors 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.760
 with it's 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.900
 rsr 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
 with fixing guti 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.010
 with different gametes 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.750
 and I close and smooth it does not necessarily serve when we like 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.580
 I want flowers on one side 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.530
 the parent like a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.250
 m neodymium magnet 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.610
 or limit it 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 the two axes 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.270
 finally unlocked 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 the trouble of squeezing them too hard 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.790
 that's it for the second 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.790
 you cast actors 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 still after sacred in hand 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 Internal Affairs 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.800
 ap but i'm when we're ready 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
 then the bottom 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.160
 you take an axis 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.430
 is between the two supports 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.530
 that's all alone with its elements 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 ennahar our axes which are convinced on each side 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.660
 eliminated the friction which was excellent training 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.839
 on one side and the crÃ©mants 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.779
 the side is levitating 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.019
 see that the 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.049
 at its entrance to the pyla peak 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.479
 which allowed to have been able to this point 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.189
 of contact 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.589
 so bush 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.639
 what suits you 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 you have forgotten several diameters 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:34.979
 for the role 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.819
 so it will be this one gave to the smallest 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.589
 2nd vice 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.589
 sign that cash in our case but this is just an example 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.489
 so to place it against the elements 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.969
 now 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.079
 I will remove the high school students 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.469
 with clotilde 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 but at peak pareto and sacrifices 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.839
 attention what the tendency to jump 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.509
 good 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.590
 with the lists 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.669
 the crown 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.669
 here we have a cleavage 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.669
 what a beauty doctor in the crown 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.200
 so that the center of gravity of the propeller and slightly deported a 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 side 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.049
 you own from here 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.449
 on one side of the bce 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.659
 the court of the other 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.209
 that's why these approaches correctly well opposite 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.209
 this year in a nightmare 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.419
 and now 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.909
 still balancing 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.709
 it was final here 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.859
 but in Serbia 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.269
 and we immediately see the difference 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.289
 balancing 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.289
 noble for all steel series 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.739
 is heavier than this one 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.339
 to fix it we will balance 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.449
 with the special scotcher 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.449
 duthie city complaint why coupet a piece 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.969
 I want to go temporarily 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.110
 on the lists 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.980
 his colleague completely 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.080
 at the end 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.080
 change it if necessary 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.009
 so we can see that it's easy 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.499
 concentrated 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.499
 compared to the good bce I wanted a little bit 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.529
 jean-yves migneault umpteenth center of gravity 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.439
 it's still tight 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.169
 we would have the location 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.669
 just for love 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.180
 he opens the way both sides 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.180
 it's the same thing 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.469
 so the tape is well positioned 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.979
 we will be able to pick up 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.979
 uselessly 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.419
 little bit below 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:41.309
 we check 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.409
 he solicits is balanced 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.089
 And so on 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.419
 two ornais 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.419
 all in class 5 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.550
 correctly 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.110
 johnsson the nice talk 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.349
 it is this crew 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.080
 there will be more cars 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.080
 therefore a better engine performance 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.349
 with his volt 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.819
 you find this balance hours 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.819
 finally other products on the branch 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.960
 on the forum channel 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.180
 renault by as much as
