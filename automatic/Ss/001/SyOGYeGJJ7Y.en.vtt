got a little stagnant with our office
and<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.200> didn't<00:00:37.620> put<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:37.890> enough<00:00:38.160> points<00:00:38.190> in

and we didn't put up enough points in

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.330 
and we didn't put up enough points in
the<00:00:38.670> fourth<00:00:38.850> quarter<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:40.050> know<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> we

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the fourth quarter you know and we

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.380 
the fourth quarter you know and we
didn't<00:00:41.490> keep<00:00:41.610> Johnny's<00:00:41.910> maggie's<00:00:42.180> off<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
didn't keep Johnny's maggie's off the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
didn't keep Johnny's maggie's off the
board<00:00:42.740> your<00:00:43.740> whole<00:00:43.890> defense<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.340> waiting<00:00:44.670> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
board your whole defense was waiting on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.120 
board your whole defense was waiting on
me<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.040> the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
me so you know I think that's one of the

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.090 
me so you know I think that's one of the
better<00:00:50.310> defensive<00:00:50.520> teams<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.890> they<00:00:52.890> had<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
better defensive teams and they had a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.350 
better defensive teams and they had a
scheme<00:00:53.400> which<00:00:53.640> would<00:00:53.790> they<00:00:53.879> wanted<00:00:54.150> to<00:00:54.239> go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
scheme which would they wanted to go

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.680 
scheme which would they wanted to go
with<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> fourth<00:00:55.080> quarter<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.650> you<00:00:56.610> know

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
with in the fourth quarter and you know

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
with in the fourth quarter and you know
I<00:00:57.870> started<00:00:58.500> cramping<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> end<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I started cramping up and at the end of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.009 
I started cramping up and at the end of
the<00:00:59.789> third<00:00:59.969> quarter<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:00.420> why<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> came<00:01:00.780> out

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
the third quarter that's why I came out

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.560 
the third quarter that's why I came out
the<00:01:01.050> game<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the game and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210 
the game and
it<00:01:04.080> took<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.470> rhythm<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.100> me<00:01:05.190> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it took a little rhythm all for me I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
it took a little rhythm all for me I
think<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.840> know<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> credit<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

but<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:08.290> know<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> fourth<00:02:08.740> fourth<00:02:09.160> quarter

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
but you know the fourth fourth quarter

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.600 
but you know the fourth fourth quarter
and<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.140> think<00:02:11.350> it<00:02:11.440> became<00:02:11.800> more<00:02:12.010> frustrating

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and I think it became more frustrating

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.160 
and I think it became more frustrating
you<00:02:12.730> know<00:02:12.760> with<00:02:13.030> Otto<00:02:13.270> offensive<00:02:13.780> rebounds

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
you know with Otto offensive rebounds

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.810 
you know with Otto offensive rebounds
they<00:02:14.290> were<00:02:14.410> getting<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.040> we<00:02:15.460> play<00:02:15.640> good

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
they were getting you know we play good

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.750 
they were getting you know we play good
defense<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.980> would<00:02:18.130> bail<00:02:18.280> them<00:02:18.310> out<00:02:18.520> with

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
defense and we would bail them out with

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.640 
defense and we would bail them out with
offensive<00:02:19.090> rebounds<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.720> think<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.290> me<00:02:20.620> I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
offensive rebounds I think that was me I

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.710 
offensive rebounds I think that was me I
think<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.130> was<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.610> reason<00:02:21.910> why<00:02:22.150> we<00:02:22.300> lost<00:02:22.450> I

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
think that was the reason why we lost I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.740 
think that was the reason why we lost I
think<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:23.830> identified<00:02:24.700> our<00:02:24.880> problems<00:02:25.330> you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
think we identified our problems you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.490 
think we identified our problems you
know<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.140> think<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.590> first<00:02:27.750> two<00:02:28.750> two<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
know and I think the first two two and a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.750 
know and I think the first two two and a
half<00:02:29.680> quarters<00:02:30.040> i<00:02:30.190> think<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.520> saw<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
half quarters i think you saw a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.460 
half quarters i think you saw a
different<00:02:31.000> number<00:02:31.690> out<00:02:31.840> there<00:02:32.020> then<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.290> saw

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
different number out there then you saw

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.770 
different number out there then you saw
the<00:02:32.530> last<00:02:32.860> two<00:02:33.040> games<00:02:33.280> we<00:02:34.030> play<00:02:34.209> harder<00:02:34.660> we

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the last two games we play harder we

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.300 
the last two games we play harder we
played<00:02:35.020> with<00:02:35.170> more<00:02:35.350> effort<00:02:37.350> however<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:39.190> know

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
played with more effort however you know

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.520 
played with more effort however you know
we<00:02:39.490> broke<00:02:39.880> down<00:02:39.940> we<00:02:40.750> broke<00:02:40.930> down<00:02:40.990> at<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.410> end

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
we broke down we broke down at the end

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.560 
we broke down we broke down at the end
of<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> game<00:02:41.740> when<00:02:42.070> we<00:02:42.130> needed<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
of the game when we needed to be the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.980 
of the game when we needed to be the
toughest<00:02:44.020> smokes<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.500> know<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.810> think<00:02:46.810> with

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
toughest smokes you know I think with

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.110 
toughest smokes you know I think with
the<00:02:47.170> beer<00:02:47.440> men<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.280> mixers<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:48.820> mean<00:02:48.970> those

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the beer men and the mixers I mean those

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.580 
the beer men and the mixers I mean those
are<00:02:49.270> two<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.540> tougher<00:02:49.930> teams<00:02:50.170> around<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
are two of the tougher teams around the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.230 
are two of the tougher teams around the
league<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.270> those<00:02:52.270> are<00:02:52.420> our<00:02:52.510> two<00:02:52.660> losses<00:02:52.900> and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
league and those are our two losses and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.820 
league and those are our two losses and
but<00:02:55.240> we<00:02:55.360> know<00:02:55.570> they're<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.410> be<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:56.709> in

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
but we know they're going to be there in

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.740 
but we know they're going to be there in
the<00:02:56.920> playoffs<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:58.300> know<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.570> know<00:02:58.720> we

gotta focus on the next game and we got
to<00:03:06.400> keep<00:03:06.519> battling<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.300> practice<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.900> keep

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
to keep battling in practice and keep

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.750 
to keep battling in practice and keep
identifying<00:03:08.739> what<00:03:09.070> is<00:03:09.220> our<00:03:09.519> weak<00:03:09.730> points<00:03:10.230> I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
identifying what is our weak points I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.979 
identifying what is our weak points I
think<00:03:12.760> coach<00:03:12.970> may<00:03:13.209> throw<00:03:13.450> me<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> little<00:03:13.840> bit

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
think coach may throw me a little bit

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.930 
think coach may throw me a little bit
more<00:03:14.170> at<00:03:14.290> before<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.950> be<00:03:15.070> able<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.310> go<00:03:15.459> or<00:03:15.610> you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
more at before to be able to go or you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.910 
more at before to be able to go or you
know<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.209> imports<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.930> think<00:03:17.560> that's<00:03:17.739> probably

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
know the imports I think that's probably

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.620 
know the imports I think that's probably
going<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.610> strategy<00:03:18.880> from<00:03:19.300> here<00:03:19.510> on

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
going to be the strategy from here on

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.020 
going to be the strategy from here on
out<00:03:19.810> where<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.769> can<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:20.950> battle<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> import<00:03:21.910> I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
out where I can just battle the import I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.340 
out where I can just battle the import I
mean<00:03:22.180> tonight<00:03:22.510> we<00:03:22.660> try<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> play<00:03:23.110> me<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.290> little

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
mean tonight we try to play me a little

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.440 
mean tonight we try to play me a little
bit<00:03:23.620> our<00:03:23.739> point<00:03:23.980> guard<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.730> think<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.420> takes

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
bit our point guard but I think it takes

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.000 
bit our point guard but I think it takes
away<00:03:25.690> from<00:03:25.870> our<00:03:26.110> rebounding<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.620> little<00:03:26.890> bit

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
away from our rebounding a little bit

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.759 
away from our rebounding a little bit
with<00:03:27.280> me<00:03:27.400> out<00:03:27.580> at<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.880> point<00:03:28.090> guard<00:03:28.150> position

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
with me out at the point guard position

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.870 
with me out at the point guard position
tonight<00:03:29.769> was<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.160> first<00:03:30.280> game<00:03:30.519> I've<00:03:30.700> actually

and I think that's why i was able to

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.900 
and I think that's why i was able to
shake<00:03:43.600> loose<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.200> little<00:03:44.440> bit<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.910> you
