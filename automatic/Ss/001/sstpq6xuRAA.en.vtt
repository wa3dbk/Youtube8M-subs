00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 andy without favorite music 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.900
 hello beautiful welcome again to 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.760
 my channel today I want us to make a 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.530
 super super fast recipe that is going to 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.639
 bail out and it's a cream for 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.520
 anoint and you're obviously going to need tuna 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.650
 I do not use tuna with oil 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.240
 I always use tuna with water if you 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.860
 you want to do it with oil over there but 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.160
 I always recommend for these things 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.770
 use tuna also in water too 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.240
 you're going to need onions and garlic 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.030
 I'm doing with red onion because 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.980
 I like picosito but you can do it 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.800
 with white onion if you like like that with 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.470
 a Filipino mast burn and garlic and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.260
 You will also need paprika 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.540
 because it was red the paprika that I had not 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.940
 I had green I prefer to do it sometimes with 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.550
 green but good red is nothing 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.560
 bad and celery is also very important 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.470
 stone very well with the tuna quoted 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.730
 then there we are going to use it and I am 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.360
 also using lemon 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.040
 I have two little games to throw 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.710
 juice two lemons because I always like 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.810
 it is like acid but you can of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.420
 soon put a little less you can 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 put the one of a lemon cap 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.570
 everything is like the taste of one the mustard 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.040
 if you are doing for yourself a 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.110
 teaspoon if you're doing to 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.470
 share that it's pretty then then 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.020
 put a tablespoon and also 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.640
 we will use 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.590
 a little bit of milk cream 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.000
 necessarily clarified has to be this 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.930
 mark then of the cream of milk that you 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.780
 you consume zero calories I do not know I do not know 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.210
 without fat I do not know which one you use 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.670
 it necessarily has to be and good 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.330
 this as you can use it with 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.250
 Toast cookies in sandwich if you 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.470
 it's too thick you can do it 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.319
 then but I will do it as in 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.310
 some do not eat snacks I should use 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:59.080
 lettuce and I'm also going to use bread from 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.240
 mold of this that has as a seed 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.280
 we leave a cop 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.250
 that I really like you can use 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.009
 also like French bread tastes super rich 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.630
 also or bread from this garlic valley that 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.760
 It is also very very rich and it goes very well 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.700
 with him and basically what you have to 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.310
 to do is to throw the whole blender from 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.849
 the tuna passing through the onion 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.220
 Garlic the paprika the celery and apply it then 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.459
 as the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.560
 as I tell them to donate the mustard and 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.280
 the lemon and the little bit of milk cream 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.739
 then it is very simple 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.420
 you can do not necessarily have 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.569
 to be an adult to do it if you're 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.090
 You can do a nobel while you have 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.550
 citizen but it can be really 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.160
 anyone as they see is super 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.420
 super healthy does not carry any fat no 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.000
 it's straight is 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.260
 in fact he did not even salt him if you 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.520
 you want you can apply a little bit of 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.380
 salt but I did not even salt 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.569
 so it's a meal then really 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.980
 pretty healthy there the only thing that has to 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.550
 join us suddenly would be the cream of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.739
 milk for the rest everything is fine 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.739
 and as lunch you can eat it 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.560
 at night a little bit then it's 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.500
 really a meal that does not take trouble 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.480
 at any time when you have 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.220
 a whole blender possibly that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.390
 start processing if you have a processor 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.489
 of food because you can also 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.220
 do there you do not necessarily have to 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.319
 doing it in blender can happen to you like 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750
 it happened to me that what I put in the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.510
 blender is like a lot and then it 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.310
 It is very heavy and can not then 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.959
 is that that towards the blender but that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.970
 with the help of a spoon it starts like 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.190
 to wiggle everything not with the blender 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.840
 lit clear so that everything is 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.319
 can integrate in this way how are you 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.549
 seeing in the image and once you are ready 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.260
 Well , just what you are going to do 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.120
 is to put it as the container where 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.400
 you are going to store and take it in the fridge 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.060
 so that it is fried at the moment of 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.720
 I serve 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.599
 I usually accompany it with soda crackers or 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.300
 with suddenly like with a little bread and 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.190
 lechuguita like Style A 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.930
 sandwich or in this way that are like 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.150
 Snacks and they also look very very tasty 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.250
 and then with nothing I hope that there 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.169
 pleased that you have found this useful 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.299
