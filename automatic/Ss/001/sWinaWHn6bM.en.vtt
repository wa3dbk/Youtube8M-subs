00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.920
 and hello to all and butten he is one 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.019
 is found for the tutorial 47 of my series 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.520
 tons tutoring is so today we 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.439
 let's go make a portal of an error 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.289
 so that's gone I'm going down more 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.600
 quickly underneath so here at 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.460
 desert gate that are bustling and 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.130
 that they disable through a button 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 So here we go we will do 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:40.030
 so then so already so people to do 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.140
 the portal would not be bad 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.280
 so it's very very simple to do it 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.019
 there are not many systems behind hop 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:56.629
 so here I had presented it during 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:58.670
 my live during my live touques so 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.250
 put 2 10 pens like these 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.830
 middle of the portal position yourself a 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.540
 button then behind you go 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:12.729
 put fast impeller 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.810
 so that's to say like this 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.439
 you're going to put it like that so that's okay 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.310
 launch a quick drive in fact and here 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.979
 you're going to wait for me a piston 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.369
 here like that as soon as there will be a 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.320
 quick drive just the block 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.229
 of red stone will stay stuck at a 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.429
 place you go see me hop I 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.999
 positioned there the button like that we're going 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.249
 well see up here albou the block stays here 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.679
 and active think themselves pensser and games 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:46.399
 reactive hop it 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:49.789
 he resumes etc etc then the only concern 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.170
 So it is that on one side there will be the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.509
 a leap of lava and the other side a 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.109
 lighter and saves it that in twenty meters 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.689
 the seal of the avs 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.969
 it's just going to put it and it's not theirs 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.350
 and actually suck the lava so we go 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.249
 do a little system behind that is 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.710
 very short hop you put a repeater 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.960
 at the second notch at the second cramps at 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.330
 second 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.459
 so a torch like that so repeater 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.450
 block with the repeater piston to the second 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.819
 tic block with a torch and the nerd 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.780
 no it was not that I wanted to do 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.550
 here and his hood and the piston above 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.930
 so what piston is it going to serve from 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.739
 that the block will come here 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.900
 hop he sells it see a quick drive 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.760
 so here's just like this 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.170
 so once every two times it's this 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.760
 piston that resumes block once the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.480
 rebel piston block the ice track we have it 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.420
 do a tic 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.220
 So that's so we'll test it 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.120
 will ask we will put the seal of the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.750
 so we need a penny of lava and he 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.239
 need a lighter here is the soldier 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.650
 you put it on the seal of the you 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.989
 put where there is the piston that is 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.010
 retracts quickly and the lighter you 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.870
 put it here so we'll test at 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.380
 right now 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.060
 So here the lava the lighter lava 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.829
 the lighter lava 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.140
 here and so and so on up 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.790
 infinity at least here I hope this 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.180
 little tutorial will have pleased you but who 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.920
 can be very useful 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.070
 So here we come together 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.900
 the tutorial 48 and for my other videos and 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.120
 my other series obviously do not hesitate 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.650
 not to subscribe to like the video and has 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.579
 commented if ever there is a problem at 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.769
 system level 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.769
 obviously go on everybody
