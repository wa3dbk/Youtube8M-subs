back<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.759> white<00:01:20.939> Batman<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.720> surrounded<00:01:22.380> by

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
three other characters you'd want to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
three other characters you'd want to
attack<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:25.020> him<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.130> roll<00:01:26.310> our<00:01:26.340> dice<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
attack just him so we roll our dice and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.160 
attack just him so we roll our dice and
we<00:01:27.390> actually<00:01:27.420> end<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.840> rolling<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.320> ten<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> we

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
we actually end up rolling a ten so we

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.800 
we actually end up rolling a ten so we
would<00:01:31.380> hit<00:01:31.650> Batman<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.549> our<00:01:32.640> normal<00:01:33.150> damage

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
would hit Batman for our normal damage

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.859 
would hit Batman for our normal damage
which<00:01:34.290> i<00:01:34.439> believe<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.710> three<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.299> Batman<00:01:36.689> would

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
which i believe is three so Batman would

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
which i believe is three so Batman would
take<00:01:37.049> three<00:01:37.320> damage<00:01:37.560> minuses<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
take three damage minuses one for the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
take three damage minuses one for the
ability<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> use<00:01:39.450> toughness<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> then

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
ability to use toughness and then

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
ability to use toughness and then
everybody<00:01:41.850> else<00:01:41.909> would<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.840> technically<00:01:43.530> hit

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
everybody else would be technically hit

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.620 
everybody else would be technically hit
by<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.590> attack<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.329> everyone<00:01:48.329> else<00:01:48.479> would

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
by that attack so everyone else would

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
by that attack so everyone else would
get<00:01:48.780> dealt<00:01:49.049> damage<00:01:49.259> equal<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> number<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
get dealt damage equal to the number of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
get dealt damage equal to the number of
lightning<00:01:51.060> bolts<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.229> he's<00:01:52.409> got

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
lightning bolts you have so if he's got

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.030 
lightning bolts you have so if he's got
two<00:01:52.979> lightning<00:01:53.310> bolts<00:01:54.829> spider-man<00:01:55.829> would

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
two lightning bolts spider-man would

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.090 
two lightning bolts spider-man would
take<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.750> Robin<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.899> take<00:01:58.140> two<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.649> blue

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
take to Robin would take two and blue

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.819 
take to Robin would take two and blue
Batman<00:01:59.579> would<00:01:59.759> also<00:01:59.909> take<00:02:00.240> two<00:02:00.540> clicks<00:02:00.869> see

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
Batman would also take two clicks see

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.240 
Batman would also take two clicks see
how<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.159> works<00:02:03.079> likewise<00:02:04.079> if<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
how that works likewise if you want to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.240 
how that works likewise if you want to
do<00:02:05.340> attacks<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.469> spider-man<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> same<00:02:08.009> time

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
do attacks a spider-man at the same time

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.830 
do attacks a spider-man at the same time
you<00:02:08.399> attack<00:02:08.580> Batman<00:02:09.030> since<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.539> two

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
you attack Batman since you do have two

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.660 
you attack Batman since you do have two
lightning<00:02:10.050> bolts<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.530> could<00:02:11.009> technically<00:02:11.459> do

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
lightning bolts you could technically do

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.870 
lightning bolts you could technically do
that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.480 
that
and<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.900> could<00:02:14.140> give<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:14.950> damage<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
and you could give you up your damage to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.820 
and you could give you up your damage to
say<00:02:15.670> Batman<00:02:16.090> would<00:02:16.240> get<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.050> spider-man

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
say Batman would get to and spider-man

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.880 
say Batman would get to and spider-man
and<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.190> one<00:02:18.490> then<00:02:19.390> blue<00:02:20.140> Batman<00:02:20.620> would<00:02:20.770> be

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
and get one then blue Batman would be

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380 
and get one then blue Batman would be
dealt<00:02:21.100> four<00:02:21.520> clicks<00:02:21.940> because<00:02:22.240> he's

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
dealt four clicks because he's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.060 
dealt four clicks because he's
technically<00:02:22.780> adjacent<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.710> hit

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
technically adjacent to to hit

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.640 
technically adjacent to to hit
characters<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.140> Robin<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.290> still<00:02:26.530> be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
characters and Robin would still be

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.640 
characters and Robin would still be
dealt<00:02:26.890> two<00:02:27.460> clicks<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.350> kind<00:02:29.560> of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
dealt two clicks so it's kind of

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.190 
dealt two clicks so it's kind of
depending<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.190> how<00:02:30.490> you<00:02:30.550> want<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.300> go<00:02:31.900> about

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
depending on how you want to go about

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.980 
depending on how you want to go about
that<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.770> do<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.760> then<00:02:34.360> remember<00:02:34.600> that

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
that and do that and then remember that

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.740 
that and do that and then remember that
each<00:02:35.320> characters<00:02:36.280> are<00:02:36.550> dealt<00:02:36.850> one<00:02:37.210> damage<00:02:37.570> for

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
each characters are dealt one damage for

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.120 
each characters are dealt one damage for
each<00:02:37.780> lightning<00:02:38.380> bolt<00:02:38.560> printed<00:02:38.920> on<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
each lightning bolt printed on the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.940 
each lightning bolt printed on the
characters<00:02:39.490> base<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.950> untargeted

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
characters base so the untargeted

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.860 
characters base so the untargeted
characters<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.760> what<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.330> referring<00:02:43.840> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
characters is what that is referring to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.170 
characters is what that is referring to
a<00:02:44.230> lot<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.830> times<00:02:45.160> characters<00:02:45.640> with<00:02:45.850> three

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
a lot of times characters with three

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.250 
a lot of times characters with three
lightning<00:02:46.390> bolts<00:02:46.720> are<00:02:46.840> perfect<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> have

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
lightning bolts are perfect to have

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.990 
lightning bolts are perfect to have
energy<00:02:47.470> explosion<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.250> because<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.790> can

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
energy explosion on because you can

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.810 
energy explosion on because you can
wreak<00:02:49.240> a<00:02:49.420> lot<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:50.020> damage<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:51.160> example<00:02:51.580> if

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
wreak a lot of damage for example if

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.720 
wreak a lot of damage for example if
spider-man<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.930> there<00:02:53.140> Batman<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.130> there<00:02:54.460> and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
spider-man is there Batman is there and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.230 
spider-man is there Batman is there and
Robin<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.230> there's<00:02:56.920> also<00:02:57.240> Thor

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
Robin is here and there's also Thor

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.750 
Robin is here and there's also Thor
standing<00:02:58.990> there<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.410> mean<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.610> an

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
standing there I mean this is an

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.840 
standing there I mean this is an
unlikely<00:03:01.120> scenario<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.990> could<00:03:02.200> happen<00:03:02.850> so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
unlikely scenario but it could happen so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.280 
unlikely scenario but it could happen so
Thor<00:03:04.060> was<00:03:04.150> standing<00:03:04.510> there<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.900> Emma<00:03:05.080> Frost

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
Thor was standing there and Emma Frost

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.950 
Thor was standing there and Emma Frost
standing<00:03:05.770> there<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.040> could<00:03:06.310> target

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
standing there you could target

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.340 
standing there you could target
spider-man<00:03:07.960> Batman<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:09.130> Robin<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.260> if<00:03:11.260> you

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
spider-man Batman and Robin and if you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.720 
spider-man Batman and Robin and if you
had<00:03:11.470> three<00:03:11.770> lightning<00:03:11.980> bolts<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.430> could<00:03:12.580> deal

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
had three lightning bolts you could deal

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.400 
had three lightning bolts you could deal
one<00:03:12.940> damage<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.270> spider-man<00:03:13.690> 1<00:03:13.960> damage<00:03:14.170> to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
one damage to spider-man 1 damage to

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.910 
one damage to spider-man 1 damage to
Batman<00:03:14.770> one<00:03:14.980> damage<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.310> Robin<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:16.360> then<00:03:16.510> also

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
Batman one damage to Robin but then also

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.620 
Batman one damage to Robin but then also
Thor<00:03:17.920> would<00:03:18.070> get<00:03:18.280> for<00:03:18.670> damage<00:03:19.180> because

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
Thor would get for damage because

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.030 
Thor would get for damage because
there's<00:03:19.990> two<00:03:20.170> lightning<00:03:20.350> bolts<00:03:20.590> coming<00:03:20.860> from

spider-man and two coming from Batman
Emma<00:03:23.320> Frost<00:03:23.500> would<00:03:23.740> get<00:03:23.920> for<00:03:24.190> damage<00:03:24.520> because

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
Emma Frost would get for damage because

coming from Batman and then blue Batman

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.200 
coming from Batman and then blue Batman
would<00:03:28.690> just<00:03:28.900> get<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.910> that's<00:03:31.000> basically

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
would just get to so that's basically

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.150 
would just get to so that's basically
all<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:32.110> energy<00:03:32.500> explosion<00:03:32.950> i<00:03:33.010> hope

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
all there is for energy explosion i hope

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.550
