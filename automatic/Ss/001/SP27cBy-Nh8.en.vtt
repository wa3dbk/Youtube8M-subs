00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.520
 correctly articulate sam 1 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.200
 our goal is our goal 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.820
 By the way, this is the game too 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.820
 I'm in favor of jumping and running 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.960
 we jump into the small age so 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.470
 Only win is the only thing that is the only one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.220
 sure to be seen for a moment 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.369
 he swallowed humor, this is often not 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.440
 Negatively meant is perhaps not so 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.290
 Well, good against bots, the sound went well 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.490
 set I think that's 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.490
 do not like yes not impossible 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.350

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.430
 and as bad as we are 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 We can definitely go one more 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.790
 improve a bit 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.910
 but politics as long as we win 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.160
 Otherwise, Thomas Mang are positive 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:29.930

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.410

 strike is still a laboratory in ceilings 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:36.039
 It was my thought, you know 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.039
 still allowed 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:10.540
