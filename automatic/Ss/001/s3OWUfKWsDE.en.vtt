00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.259
 two the end still furious 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.050
 very annoying that is stated in a proposal for this 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.699
 the first half 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.039
 and since I think the second half started very well 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 just understand it a few meters away 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.159
 but otherwise most of the canteen 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.140
 yes i set sector 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.179
 The existence of being proved to be a month earlier 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.579
 after very annoying count at that moment walking in and a load shocked many 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.640
 two goals 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.140
 that there are two more goals 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 I did feel that he was in the second half along with read more cleverness 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.930
 the fields can run away 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.000
 maybe a bit more about him 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.430
 Yes indeed 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.960
 I thought late I thought it was so nice to start once very well though 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.990
 the Council 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.320
 but how lucky he is that among other things the ball determines the bar 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 and it's that a long ball 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.050
 bowling chooses one and that will be hard to agree with if i have something 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.200
 played out in March there is made and then it is time he is fed up 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 at the bank in that phase, but just as well then you know for whom then 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 the police of antwerp team closes 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.080
 After a first chance this is just that we just got her 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.520
 say just to defend the attacking fit and disadvantages then it becomes mainly 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.410
 difficult with and 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.420
 while all players have in the front 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.689
 and I think precisely in the second half there was a lot of space to deal with 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.570
 got a percentage of a place and was depressed in the dressing room 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.560
 after his disappointing performance it is disappointing that we did not enter the match 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.660
 started 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.140
 that is not to be missed, you know yourself what disappointed 3 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.940
 that is remarkable because years back flow that is an increase with it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.070
 feet and 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.979
 I thought the tests very well enabled the suppression of 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.930
 well say threat to keep in the front 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.060
 he was 81 years old 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.160
 a little bit more 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.389
 stability on the midfielder 4 it seems today 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.739
 less but in recent weeks you know a bit more wind did not work 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:15.759
 plays less 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.579
 for many do it yourself 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.809
 The program pair matches just a quarter of the shares pharming 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.329
 not in the match
