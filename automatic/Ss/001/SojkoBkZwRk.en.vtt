it's<00:02:08.509> totally<00:02:08.869> optional<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.500> doesn't<00:02:09.770> really

but<00:02:12.319> nonetheless<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:13.099> makes<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.550> pretty

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
but nonetheless it makes this a pretty

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
developments at e3 this year he seemed

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.050 
developments at e3 this year he seemed
pretty<00:02:21.200> aware<00:02:21.739> some<00:02:22.220> players<00:02:22.489> were<00:02:22.760> looking

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
pretty aware some players were looking

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.660 
pretty aware some players were looking
to<00:02:23.209> feel<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.599> they<00:02:23.780> belong<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.440> something

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
to feel like they belong to something

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.270 
to feel like they belong to something
the<00:02:25.670> point<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.150> me<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.720> what<00:02:27.590> elite<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.099> is

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
the point to me is that what elite is is

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.160 
the point to me is that what elite is is
if<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:28.970> fact<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.330> are<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.750> very

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
if you like is the fact you are a very

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.630 
if you like is the fact you are a very
small<00:02:31.330> part<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.660> very<00:02:32.870> large<00:02:33.640> environment

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
small part of a very large environment

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.160 
small part of a very large environment
even<00:02:34.910> within<00:02:35.060> human<00:02:35.480> space<00:02:35.690> which<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.050> so

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
even within human space which is so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.740 
even within human space which is so
quite<00:02:36.379> big<00:02:36.590> which<00:02:37.370> which<00:02:37.849> is<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.330> course<00:02:38.510> in

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
quite big which which is of course in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.120 
quite big which which is of course in
turn<00:02:38.930> insignificant<00:02:39.680> compared<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
turn insignificant compared to the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.460 
turn insignificant compared to the
galaxy<00:02:40.550> but<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.570> idea<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.260> can

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
galaxy but I like the idea that you can

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.020 
galaxy but I like the idea that you can
can<00:02:42.710> club<00:02:43.010> together<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
can club together and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.480 
can club together and
you<00:02:44.090> can<00:02:44.300> gradually<00:02:44.750> change<00:02:45.110> things<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:46.370> I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
you can gradually change things and I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.699 
you can gradually change things and I
like<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:47.030> extra<00:02:47.510> layer<00:02:47.780> which<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.590> we

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
like that extra layer which I think we

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.490 
like that extra layer which I think we
were<00:02:48.890> missing<00:02:49.490> a<00:02:49.550> little<00:02:49.790> bit<00:02:49.910> before<00:02:50.500> for

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
were missing a little bit before for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.690 
were missing a little bit before for
players<00:02:51.800> who've<00:02:52.069> been<00:02:52.250> playing<00:02:52.490> we<00:02:52.610> would

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
players who've been playing we would

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.250 
players who've been playing we would
have<00:02:52.850> got<00:02:53.180> quite<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> big<00:02:53.660> community<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.110> people

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
have got quite a big community of people

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.890 
have got quite a big community of people
who've<00:02:54.620> played<00:02:54.800> for<00:02:55.640> hundreds<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.180> hours<00:02:56.480> even

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
who've played for hundreds of hours even

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.690 
who've played for hundreds of hours even
more<00:02:57.140> than<00:02:57.290> thousand<00:02:57.770> hours<00:02:58.069> but<00:02:58.340> trying<00:02:58.640> to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
more than thousand hours but trying to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910 
more than thousand hours but trying to
give<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.940> richness<00:02:59.390> for<00:02:59.569> those<00:02:59.720> people<00:03:00.110> who<00:03:00.620> you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
give a richness for those people who you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.680 
give a richness for those people who you
know<00:03:01.550> have<00:03:01.670> seen<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.940> lot<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.330> things<00:03:02.540> in

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
at CQC behind closed doors at e3 and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.020 
at CQC behind closed doors at e3 and
frankly<00:05:46.660> it<00:05:46.870> looks<00:05:47.140> really<00:05:47.860> exciting<00:05:48.250> putting

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
frankly it looks really exciting putting

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.730 
frankly it looks really exciting putting
in<00:05:49.120> our<00:05:49.240> KD<00:05:49.480> spin<00:05:49.840> on<00:05:49.960> combat<00:05:50.320> is<00:05:50.440> a<00:05:50.470> really

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
in our KD spin on combat is a really

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.770 
in our KD spin on combat is a really
smart<00:05:51.070> move<00:05:51.370> for<00:05:51.400> elite<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:52.180> think<00:05:52.450> it<00:05:52.600> no

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
smart move for elite and I think it no

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.510 
smart move for elite and I think it no
coincidence<00:05:53.470> that<00:05:53.590> it's<00:05:53.860> arriving<00:05:54.160> for<00:05:54.460> the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
coincidence that it's arriving for the

console version first overall though I

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.590

think<00:05:57.400> it'll<00:05:57.520> make<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.760> welcome<00:05:58.030> addition<00:05:58.570> to

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
think it'll make a welcome addition to
