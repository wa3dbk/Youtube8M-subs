00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 Welcome to the online garden 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.250
 not only have to taste good 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.099
 Nuts are not known to be very healthy 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.440
 The greeks must have been wrong 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.809
 leaves food now called one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.190
 walnut which is ennobled is growing very much 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.529
 fast and brings very fast too 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 a good harvest in the last few weeks 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.449
 I'll call again 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.670
 what does it mean if a nut turns out to be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.640
 does not turn black from the peel trend 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.430
 Inedible is one to two 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.370
 phenomena once the so-called 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.750
 Martians picture now against this mushroom 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.059
 could you do the following? 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 they cut the walnut even if he does 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.430
 escapes have been strong in august 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.180
 More light air and sun in a tree 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.469
 can bring 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.199
 the less the danger of so-called 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.770
 abroad knows the next phenomenon is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.030
 the so-called walnut fruit fly 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.300
 This trading we have not so 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.110
 long this care pleases these nuts 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.479
 and the larvae board through now against 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 The walnut fruit fly is still around 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.890
 no insecticide it's legal 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 I do not help anyone by doing so 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.970
 do the following 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.920
 First, they can now plant in the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.890
 autumn intense with an organic 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.960
 fertilizer we know the plants better 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 are nourished the better you can be 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 also fight against pests 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.689
 all plants have their own mechanisms 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.320
 to fight against pests and diseases 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.290
 to become 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 the second in june you exciting on the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.729
 ground a net out of that a span 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.189
 has 15 mm not bigger because then 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.590
 You can do all the damage to the ground 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.689
 fall or crawl off the ground with it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.119
 So start two options 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.600
 tension the tree and thin the tree well 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.549
 anything else 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.950
 now in autumn you can still see walnut 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.130
 legs must be replaced by majestic ones 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.780
 trees and a harvest a rich crop 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.049
 is in a few years with fathers trees 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 really
