 there are a lot of girls and boys and I have 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.229

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.290
 we adults understand the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.920
 diversity as something positive as something 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.740

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.109
 say it is 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.859
 professional and human sense has 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.859
 changed as a person 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:00.120

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:04.270
