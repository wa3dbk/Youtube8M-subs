00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.060 
seeing all my videos I do a lot of one
stroke<00:00:30.060> using<00:00:30.420> different<00:00:31.050> kinds<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> cakes<00:00:31.710> if

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.060 
you haven't started that technique I
highly<00:00:35.100> suggest<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.530> so

highly suggest that you do it's so so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.389 
highly suggest that you do it's so so
much<00:00:38.250> faster<00:00:38.550> than<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.750> traditional<00:00:40.440> methods

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
much faster than the traditional methods

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.450 
much faster than the traditional methods
and<00:00:41.700> your<00:00:42.570> results<00:00:43.230> will<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.469> much<00:00:44.190> more

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and your results will be much more

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.930 
and your results will be much more
impressive<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.500> encourage<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
impressive so I really encourage you the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.479 
impressive so I really encourage you the
cakes<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:49.350> expensive<00:00:49.800> than<00:00:50.280> regular

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
cakes are more expensive than regular

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.040 
cakes are more expensive than regular
paints<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.480> they<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.500> my<00:00:53.070> opinion<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:54.050> go

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
paints and they do in my opinion a go

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.470 
paints and they do in my opinion a go
you<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.440> through<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.829> faster<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.270> think

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you go through them faster but I think

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
you go through them faster but I think
it's<00:00:57.600> worth<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> extra<00:00:59.489> money

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's worth it I think the extra money

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's worth it I think the extra money
will<00:00:59.820> spend<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.149> materials<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.039> well<00:01:02.039> worth

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
will spend on materials is well worth

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.390 
will spend on materials is well worth
the<00:01:03.059> cost<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:04.049> results<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> your

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the cost of your results in your

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.969 
the cost of your results in your
improved<00:01:05.909> face<00:01:06.360> paint<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
that has a red and a black next to each
other<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> best<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.610> don't

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

other that would be the best I don't
have<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.920> since

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
have that so I'm going to use this since

have that so I'm going to use this since
my<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.180> blue<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.799> most

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
my just blue right here is the the most

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.420 
my just blue right here is the the most
intense<00:01:26.400> color<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> cake<00:01:28.430> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
intense color I have in a cake you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.390 
intense color I have in a cake you
basically<00:01:29.909> want<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.720> least<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.740> medium<00:01:32.159> tone

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
basically want at least a medium tone

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.810 
basically want at least a medium tone
color<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> very<00:01:33.450> dark<00:01:33.840> intense<00:01:34.350> color

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
color and then a very dark intense color

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.390 
color and then a very dark intense color
it<00:01:35.820> doesn't<00:01:36.000> matter<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> colors<00:01:36.930> are

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
it doesn't matter what the colors are

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
it doesn't matter what the colors are
red<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.520> black<00:01:38.640> would<00:01:38.880> probably<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
red and black would probably look the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230 
red and black would probably look the
best<00:01:40.259> though<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> load

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
best though so you're going to load

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.639 
best though so you're going to load
those<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.540> half<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.380> half<00:01:43.560> onto<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.840> small<00:01:45.840> flat

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
those up half in half onto a small flat

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.219 
those up half in half onto a small flat
brush<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.399> take<00:01:50.549> practice<00:01:51.229> just

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
brush and this will take practice just

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.399 
brush and this will take practice just
practice<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:53.009> arm<00:01:53.250> until<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.259> these

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
practice on your arm until you get these

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
practice on your arm until you get these

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
strokes down and I'll show you two how

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620 
strokes down and I'll show you two how
to<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.530> using<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.270> know<00:02:00.390> regular

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to do this using a you know regular

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810 
to do this using a you know regular
round<00:02:01.020> brush<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.890> color<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.430> you

this<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.530> Mark<00:03:11.739> Reed's<00:03:11.950> design<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:13.000> didn't

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
this is Mark Reed's design so I didn't

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.990 
this is Mark Reed's design so I didn't
make<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.870> up<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.920> looks<00:03:15.040> familiar<00:03:15.280> it's

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
make it up and if it looks familiar it's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.699 
make it up and if it looks familiar it's
probably<00:03:16.060> kids<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.569> guys<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:17.110> his<00:03:17.319> video<00:03:17.650> to

like I do of course I don't do it as

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.500 
like I do of course I don't do it as
good<00:03:25.840> as<00:03:26.049> he<00:03:26.200> does<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:27.190> try<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:29.489> fill<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:30.790> the

rest for the arms you're going to use

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.060 
rest for the arms you're going to use
the<00:03:35.709> same<00:03:35.980> exact<00:03:36.430> technique<00:03:39.480> point<00:03:41.070> point

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
the same exact technique point point

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.720 
the same exact technique point point
point<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.739> wanted<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.070> kind<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.519> look

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:00.510 

point<00:03:53.980> point<00:03:58.090> okay<00:03:59.090> now<00:03:59.330> I'm<00:03:59.480> going<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.750> use<00:03:59.959> a

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
point point okay now I'm going to use a

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.260 
point point okay now I'm going to use a
black<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:04.370> number<00:04:04.700> one<00:04:04.850> brush<00:04:05.569> and<00:04:07.270> this

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
black and a number one brush and this

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.240 
black and a number one brush and this
design<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.780> all<00:04:09.200> about<00:04:09.260> strokes<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.100> you're

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
design is all about strokes so you're

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.890 
design is all about strokes so you're
probably<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.970> have<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.239> practice<00:04:11.450> a

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
probably going to have to practice a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.960 
probably going to have to practice a
little<00:04:12.020> bit<00:04:12.260> because<00:04:12.800> it's<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.430> very<00:04:13.580> quick

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
little bit because it's a very quick

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.990 
little bit because it's a very quick
design<00:04:14.420> but<00:04:15.230> for<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:15.950> look<00:04:16.130> right<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.760> to

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
design but for it to look right and to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.180 
design but for it to look right and to
be<00:04:17.120> done<00:04:17.299> quickly<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:18.079> have<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.530> get<00:04:18.709> the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
be done quickly you have to get the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.850 
be done quickly you have to get the
brush<00:04:19.430> strokes<00:04:19.820> down<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.760> for<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.080> little

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
brush strokes down so for the little

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.590 
brush strokes down so for the little
point<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:27.410> do<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> point<00:04:27.950> going<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.340> way<00:04:28.600> for

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
point just do a point going that way for

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.710 
point just do a point going that way for
these<00:04:29.840> you're<00:04:30.470> going<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.680> only<00:04:31.450> underline<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
these you're going to only underline the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.810 
these you're going to only underline the
bottom<00:04:33.110> section<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:34.460> you're<00:04:34.550> going<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.700> go

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
bottom section so you're going to go

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.280 
bottom section so you're going to go
