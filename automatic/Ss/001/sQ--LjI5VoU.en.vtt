switch<00:00:04.799> here<00:00:05.450> hold<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.839> noodles<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.830> down

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
switch here hold the noodles going down

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.220 
switch here hold the noodles going down
there<00:00:08.160> very<00:00:08.340> quickly<00:00:08.630> another<00:00:09.630> meal<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.990> going

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
there very quickly another meal is going

down<00:00:10.380> think<00:00:10.620> by<00:00:10.740> here<00:00:10.950> needs<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> little

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
down think by here needs to be a little

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.629 
down think by here needs to be a little
bit<00:00:12.179> more<00:00:12.389> careful<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.340> mean<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.429> think

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
bit more careful here I mean I think

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
bit more careful here I mean I think
he's<00:00:14.790> only<00:00:14.969> working<00:00:15.150> from<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.540> bases<00:00:15.900> two

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
he's only working from do bases two

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.160 
he's only working from do bases two
bases<00:00:16.949> himself<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> new<00:00:18.570> base<00:00:18.720> coming<00:00:19.050> up

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
bases himself I see a new base coming up

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.150 
bases himself I see a new base coming up
for<00:00:19.380> him<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:21.199> well<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.439> o'clock<00:00:22.740> position

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
for him at the well one o'clock position

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.189 
for him at the well one o'clock position
up<00:00:23.250> there<00:00:24.500> but<00:00:25.820> okay<00:00:26.820> maybe<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.570> saw<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
up there but okay maybe not I saw a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.630 
up there but okay maybe not I saw a
little<00:00:28.500> blob<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> thought<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.580> was

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
little blob there I thought it was

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
little blob there I thought it was
purple<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.449> looks<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.260> fire

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
purple it looks like it was just a fire

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
purple it looks like it was just a fire
bat<00:00:31.679> scouting<00:00:32.250> making<00:00:32.700> sure<00:00:32.820> there<00:00:32.969> wasn't<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
bat scouting making sure there wasn't a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.959 
bat scouting making sure there wasn't a
third<00:00:33.390> base<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> he's<00:00:35.370> definitely<00:00:35.520> working

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
third base so he's definitely working

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
third base so he's definitely working
from<00:00:36.090> two<00:00:36.270> bases<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> low

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
from two bases so it's kind of a low

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
from two bases so it's kind of a low
econ<00:00:38.520> build<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:39.090> him<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> he's<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.110> be

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
econ build from him so he's got to be

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740 
econ build from him so he's got to be
super<00:00:43.620> careful<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> keep<00:00:44.760> leta<00:00:45.360> from

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
super careful here and keep leta from

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
super careful here and keep leta from
getting<00:00:46.020> his<00:00:46.170> second<00:00:46.500> base<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.770> long<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.489> he

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
getting his second base as long as he

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.880 
getting his second base as long as he
can<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:48.420> guessing<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
can I'm guessing all these are going to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.290 
can I'm guessing all these are going to
be<00:00:49.980> lurkers<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.670> those<00:00:50.879> hydras<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:53.210> Lita<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
be lurkers all those hydras and Lita is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.729 
be lurkers all those hydras and Lita is
actually<00:00:54.690> moving<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.410> sure<00:00:55.680> if

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
actually moving out here I'm not sure if

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.380 
actually moving out here I'm not sure if
he's<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> push<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
he's going to push all the way to the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
he's going to push all the way to the
base<00:00:57.570> i<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> might<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.230> successful<00:00:58.800> if

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
base i think it might be successful if

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
base i think it might be successful if
he<00:00:59.010> does<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.340> by<00:01:00.329> hero<00:01:00.600> again<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> still

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
he does because by hero again is still

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.969 
he does because by hero again is still
only<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.920> bases<00:01:03.290> lots<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> lurkers<00:01:04.619> look

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
only a two bases lots of lurkers look

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.420 
only a two bases lots of lurkers look
morphing<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.820> oh<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.750> radiate<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.500> my

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
morphing here oh they radiate and my

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
morphing here oh they radiate and my
hero<00:01:08.790> can't<00:01:09.119> pull<00:01:09.330> those<00:01:09.540> mules<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.170> fast

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
hero can't pull those mules out fast

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.530 
hero can't pull those mules out fast
enough<00:01:10.560> he<00:01:11.369> does<00:01:11.549> pull<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> infected<00:01:12.420> me

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
enough he does pull out the infected me

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.450 
enough he does pull out the infected me
listen<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> Muellers<00:01:13.260> goes<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.369> his

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
listen the Muellers goes down but his

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
listen the Muellers goes down but his
other<00:01:14.610> me<00:01:14.760> lists<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.330> badly<00:01:15.659> hurt<00:01:16.049> right

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
other me lists are very badly hurt right

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.850 
other me lists are very badly hurt right
now<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.619> don't<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.759> any<00:01:18.030> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.600> harassment

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
now I don't think any kind of harassment

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.170 
now I don't think any kind of harassment
from<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.070> point<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.610> muta<00:01:20.909> lists<00:01:21.119> are

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
from this point on with muta lists are

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.870 
from this point on with muta lists are
going<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.229> much<00:01:22.409> done<00:01:22.880> those

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
going is going to get much done those

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.160 
going is going to get much done those
lurkers<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> help<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> lot

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
lurkers are going to help them a lot

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
lurkers are going to help them a lot
though<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:26.970> any<00:01:27.119> tanks

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
though because I don't see any tanks

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.420 
though because I don't see any tanks
anywhere<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.990> think<00:01:28.619> there<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.860> tank<00:01:29.159> coming

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
anywhere I think there is a tank coming

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
anywhere I think there is a tank coming
out<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.090> factory<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.170> there's

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
out of the factory right now but there's

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.300 
out of the factory right now but there's
no<00:01:31.500> tanks<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.549> deal<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.820> lurkers<00:01:34.130> bike<00:01:35.130> here

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
no tanks to deal with lurkers bike here

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
no tanks to deal with lurkers bike here
is<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.700> able<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> push<00:01:36.119> lead<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
is going to be able to push lead all the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
is going to be able to push lead all the
way<00:01:36.689> back<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.290> he<00:01:38.070> moves<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.610> map<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
way back if he moves down the map a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.630 
way back if he moves down the map a
little<00:01:39.180> bit<00:01:41.570> okay<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
little bit okay it's like just a lot of

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.999 
little bit okay it's like just a lot of
hatcheries<00:01:45.090> coming<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.509> here<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.899> still<00:01:46.229> no

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
hatcheries coming up here and still no

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.510 
hatcheries coming up here and still no
third<00:01:47.250> base<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.340> o'clock

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
third base I think at the one o'clock

harassment here gonna try to take out
some<00:04:13.980> SUVs<00:04:14.959> before<00:04:15.959> later<00:04:16.169> can<00:04:16.350> do<00:04:16.440> anything

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
some SUVs before later can do anything

there

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
there

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.000 
there
no<00:04:19.220> lead<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.430> thawing<00:04:20.330> at<00:04:20.690> one<00:04:20.990> lurker<00:04:21.680> there

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
no lead is thawing at one lurker there

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.920 
no lead is thawing at one lurker there
there's<00:04:22.280> such<00:04:22.640> a<00:04:22.670> large<00:04:23.000> force<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.540> lurkers

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
there's such a large force of lurkers

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.260 
there's such a large force of lurkers
though<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.350> think<00:04:24.710> if<00:04:25.340> by<00:04:25.550> hero<00:04:25.790> decided<00:04:26.210> to

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
though I think if by hero decided to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.420 
though I think if by hero decided to
push<00:04:26.510> in<00:04:26.750> he<00:04:27.080> would<00:04:27.230> be<00:04:27.950> in<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.130> good<00:04:28.220> position

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
push in he would be in a good position

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.160 
push in he would be in a good position
to<00:04:28.730> take<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.210> entire<00:04:29.270> force<00:04:29.750> from<00:04:29.930> later

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
to take out the entire force from later

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.440 
to take out the entire force from later
but<00:04:31.040> later<00:04:31.220> looks<00:04:31.730> like<00:04:31.880> he's<00:04:32.030> coming<00:04:32.270> up<00:04:32.390> here

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
but later looks like he's coming up here

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.880 
but later looks like he's coming up here
going<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.960> be<00:04:33.050> spotted<00:04:33.350> by<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.590> Overlord

to take this if he's very careful to
keep<00:05:51.320> his<00:05:51.380> lurkers<00:05:51.800> alive<00:05:52.070> okay<00:05:53.060> more

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270

lurkers okay bye hero backing off for
the<00:06:07.010> meantime<00:06:07.340> I<00:06:07.400> think<00:06:07.670> he's<00:06:07.760> gonna<00:06:07.940> try<00:06:08.090> to

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
the meantime I think he's gonna try to

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.060 
the meantime I think he's gonna try to
group<00:06:08.360> up<00:06:08.570> larger<00:06:09.050> forest<00:06:09.470> may<00:06:09.620> be<00:06:09.680> going<00:06:09.890> from

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
group up larger forest may be going from

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.060 
group up larger forest may be going from
the<00:06:10.250> side<00:06:10.630> he's<00:06:11.630> devoted<00:06:12.380> himself<00:06:12.470> mostly

the side he's devoted himself mostly

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.440 
the side he's devoted himself mostly
desert<00:06:13.460> lynxes<00:06:13.730> because<00:06:13.970> he<00:06:14.060> doesn't<00:06:14.240> have<00:06:14.390> a

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
desert lynxes because he doesn't have a

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.559 
desert lynxes because he doesn't have a
third<00:06:14.660> gas<00:06:14.930> up<00:06:15.140> yet<00:06:15.350> so

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
the place scourge in there and by here's

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.879 
the place scourge in there and by here's
a<00:06:23.999> little<00:06:24.209> bit<00:06:24.329> slow<00:06:24.599> to<00:06:24.659> pull<00:06:25.139> his<00:06:25.349> lurkers<00:06:25.739> up

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
a little bit slow to pull his lurkers up

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.379 
a little bit slow to pull his lurkers up
here<00:06:26.129> always<00:06:26.699> just<00:06:26.819> keeping<00:06:27.179> them<00:06:27.269> there

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
here always just keeping them there

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.019 
here always just keeping them there
because<00:06:27.449> his<00:06:28.159> zerglings<00:06:29.159> are<00:06:29.369> coming<00:06:29.699> in<00:06:29.819> a

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
because his zerglings are coming in a

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.299 
because his zerglings are coming in a
science<00:06:30.419> whistle<00:06:30.659> goes<00:06:30.779> down<00:06:30.989> and<00:06:31.259> once<00:06:32.159> again

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:32.309 
science whistle goes down and once again

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.569 
science whistle goes down and once again
by<00:06:33.119> here<00:06:33.359> is<00:06:33.479> forced<00:06:33.839> to<00:06:34.019> pull<00:06:34.649> back<00:06:34.889> here<00:06:35.219> by

by here is forced to pull back here by

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:37.099 
by here is forced to pull back here by
here<00:06:35.789> was<00:06:35.879> just<00:06:35.909> not<00:06:36.209> being<00:06:36.389> nearly<00:06:36.869> as

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:37.109 
here was just not being nearly as

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:39.079 
here was just not being nearly as
aggressive<00:06:37.529> as<00:06:37.619> I<00:06:37.859> think<00:06:38.339> he<00:06:38.459> should<00:06:38.639> be<00:06:38.819> to

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
aggressive as I think he should be to

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.999 
aggressive as I think he should be to
take<00:06:39.299> this<00:06:39.479> came<00:06:39.809> although<00:06:40.529> he<00:06:40.559> does<00:06:40.769> finally

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
take this came although he does finally

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.159 
take this came although he does finally
have<00:06:41.309> his<00:06:41.489> third<00:06:41.759> base<00:06:41.999> up<00:06:42.239> he's<00:06:42.809> going<00:06:43.019> to<00:06:43.109> be

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
have his third base up he's going to be

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.439 
have his third base up he's going to be
doing<00:06:43.319> a<00:06:43.649> little<00:06:44.219> bit<00:06:44.399> better<00:06:44.699> economically

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
doing a little bit better economically

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.749 
doing a little bit better economically
now<00:06:45.689> I'm<00:06:46.619> going<00:06:46.889> to<00:06:46.949> be<00:06:47.009> able<00:06:47.159> to<00:06:47.249> compete<00:06:47.549> with

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
now I'm going to be able to compete with

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.609 
now I'm going to be able to compete with
Lita<00:06:47.999> anyway<00:06:50.479> okay<00:06:51.479> now<00:06:51.689> Lita<00:06:51.989> is<00:06:52.110> coming<00:06:52.469> up

00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:52.619 
Lita anyway okay now Lita is coming up

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:54.499 
Lita anyway okay now Lita is coming up
with<00:06:53.369> the<00:06:53.489> force<00:06:53.789> I<00:06:53.969> think<00:06:54.119> he's<00:06:54.209> going<00:06:54.360> to<00:06:54.419> try

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509 
with the force I think he's going to try

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.789 
with the force I think he's going to try
to<00:06:54.569> push<00:06:54.839> the<00:06:55.049> natural<00:06:55.379> expansion<00:06:55.619> of<00:06:56.239> x<00:06:57.239> hero

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:57.799 
to push the natural expansion of x hero

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:00.559 
to push the natural expansion of x hero
the<00:06:58.799> science<00:06:59.099> facility<00:06:59.549> looks<00:07:00.059> like<00:07:00.209> actually

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
the science facility looks like actually

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:01.879 
the science facility looks like actually
is<00:07:00.689> going<00:07:00.899> to<00:07:00.989> burn<00:07:01.169> down<00:07:01.409> that's<00:07:01.709> very

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889 
is going to burn down that's very

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.419 
is going to burn down that's very
interesting<00:07:02.069> so<00:07:02.579> i<00:07:02.849> think<00:07:03.449> that<00:07:04.439> uh<00:07:04.469> ladies

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:05.429 
interesting so i think that uh ladies

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:06.649 
interesting so i think that uh ladies
gonna<00:07:05.549> have<00:07:05.699> to<00:07:05.789> rebuild<00:07:06.149> his<00:07:06.360> science

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
gonna have to rebuild his science

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:11.179 
gonna have to rebuild his science
facility<00:07:07.669> third<00:07:08.669> base<00:07:08.879> is<00:07:09.149> up<00:07:09.769> for<00:07:10.769> by<00:07:10.949> hearing

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:11.189 
facility third base is up for by hearing

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:12.499 
facility third base is up for by hearing
by<00:07:11.399> here<00:07:11.579> is<00:07:11.669> going<00:07:11.789> to<00:07:11.849> come<00:07:12.029> in<00:07:12.179> from<00:07:12.479> the

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
by here is going to come in from the

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.449 
by here is going to come in from the
side<00:07:12.779> with<00:07:12.959> all<00:07:13.259> of<00:07:13.409> those<00:07:13.529> zerglings<00:07:14.009> i'm<00:07:14.249> not

sure if there's anything here for later

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.839 
sure if there's anything here for later
later<00:07:16.319> doesn't<00:07:16.619> have<00:07:16.709> anything<00:07:16.919> here<00:07:17.249> so<00:07:17.279> old

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:17.849 
later doesn't have anything here so old

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.909 
later doesn't have anything here so old
ladies<00:07:18.389> bringing<00:07:18.749> his<00:07:18.839> entire<00:07:19.109> army<00:07:19.469> back<00:07:19.649> and

ladies bringing his entire army back and
once<00:07:20.429> again<00:07:20.519> by<00:07:20.819> heroes<00:07:21.149> kind<00:07:21.389> of<00:07:21.479> delaying

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 
once again by heroes kind of delaying

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.469 
once again by heroes kind of delaying
himself<00:07:22.709> there<00:07:22.889> and<00:07:23.039> attacking<00:07:23.360> it's<00:07:24.360> going

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
himself there and attacking it's going

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:25.969 
himself there and attacking it's going
to<00:07:24.539> take<00:07:24.689> out<00:07:24.809> that<00:07:24.929> refinery<00:07:25.439> though<00:07:25.679> and

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 
to take out that refinery though and

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.449 
to take out that refinery though and
this<00:07:26.849> is<00:07:26.969> just<00:07:27.029> another<00:07:27.329> way<00:07:28.229> to<00:07:28.259> keep<00:07:28.799> science

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:29.459 
this is just another way to keep science

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:31.429 
this is just another way to keep science
vessels<00:07:29.759> from<00:07:29.879> coming<00:07:30.239> out<00:07:30.329> since<00:07:31.259> that

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:31.439 
vessels from coming out since that

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:32.809 
vessels from coming out since that
science<00:07:31.769> facility<00:07:32.099> is<00:07:32.189> going<00:07:32.369> to<00:07:32.459> burn<00:07:32.610> down

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 
science facility is going to burn down

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.419 
science facility is going to burn down
Lita<00:07:33.539> is<00:07:33.659> working<00:07:33.959> from<00:07:34.110> only<00:07:34.619> one<00:07:34.829> gas<00:07:35.099> right

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:35.429 
Lita is working from only one gas right

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:38.029 
Lita is working from only one gas right
now<00:07:35.459> so<00:07:36.179> those<00:07:37.139> science<00:07:37.469> vessels<00:07:37.799> are<00:07:37.889> going

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 
now so those science vessels are going

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.209 
now so those science vessels are going
to<00:07:38.159> come<00:07:38.549> out<00:07:38.579> very<00:07:39.329> very<00:07:39.449> slowly<00:07:40.099> looks<00:07:41.099> like

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:41.219 
to come out very very slowly looks like

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:42.499 
to come out very very slowly looks like
another<00:07:41.339> building<00:07:41.909> is<00:07:41.999> going<00:07:42.119> to<00:07:42.209> come<00:07:42.360> up

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:42.509 
another building is going to come up

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.959 
another building is going to come up
soon<00:07:43.079> for<00:07:43.469> by<00:07:43.589> hero<00:07:43.860> so<00:07:44.459> not<00:07:44.579> sure<00:07:44.729> what<00:07:44.879> it's

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:44.969 
soon for by hero so not sure what it's

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:46.489 
soon for by hero so not sure what it's
going<00:07:45.059> to<00:07:45.119> be<00:07:45.179> yet<00:07:45.479> that<00:07:45.689> drones<00:07:45.959> just<00:07:46.289> kind<00:07:46.469> of

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:46.499 
going to be yet that drones just kind of

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.159 
going to be yet that drones just kind of
idling<00:07:46.889> on<00:07:47.009> the<00:07:47.099> creep<00:07:47.989> here's<00:07:48.989> a<00:07:49.049> first

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.169 
idling on the creep here's a first

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.100 
idling on the creep here's a first
person<00:07:49.379> perspective<00:07:49.529> of<00:07:50.099> Lita<00:07:50.929> we<00:07:51.929> just

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110 
person perspective of Lita we just

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.419 
person perspective of Lita we just
filling<00:07:52.319> up<00:07:52.409> the<00:07:52.499> dropship<00:07:52.919> so<00:07:53.099> I<00:07:53.129> think<00:07:53.249> he's

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:53.429 
filling up the dropship so I think he's

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.739 
filling up the dropship so I think he's
going<00:07:53.519> to<00:07:53.579> try<00:07:53.759> to<00:07:53.789> do<00:07:53.939> some<00:07:54.119> harassment<00:07:54.269> suit

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:54.749 
going to try to do some harassment suit

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:57.049 
going to try to do some harassment suit
at<00:07:54.959> that<00:07:55.169> new<00:07:55.379> base<00:07:55.589> yes<00:07:55.919> he<00:07:56.069> is<00:07:56.189> he's<00:07:56.699> going<00:07:56.909> to

00:07:57.049 --> 00:07:57.059 
at that new base yes he is he's going to

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.759 
at that new base yes he is he's going to
fly<00:07:57.239> straight<00:07:57.629> to<00:07:57.749> the<00:07:57.839> two<00:07:57.929> o'clock<00:07:58.139> base<00:07:58.469> oh

00:07:58.759 --> 00:07:58.769 
fly straight to the two o'clock base oh

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.889 
fly straight to the two o'clock base oh
it's<00:07:59.729> very<00:07:59.939> dangerous<00:08:00.179> for<00:08:00.389> him<00:08:00.539> to<00:08:00.659> do<00:08:00.779> it

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:00.899 
it's very dangerous for him to do it

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:03.649 
it's very dangerous for him to do it
