00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello dear friends here decided 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.420
 today show how because 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.109
 approaches made a hacksaw for metal and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 universal tree is an old sample 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.420
 just redone a new way now you 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 all look you see i will tell that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 Why did I have these things? 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.809
 and pieces of studs thread 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.520
 I had small pieces and I'm here 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.250
 drilled a hole with a diameter of 5 somewhere 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.149
 by 5 centimeters and in a twisted stud 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 diameter 6 and clamped it all law 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.010
 We touch here such nut on 6 also with 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.219
 the other side and this is 5 centimeters 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:02.239
 again drilled hole 6 and the pin 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:06.920
 nut i think you will need a size 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.920
 this size of this bar 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:22.259
 23 23 centimeters and 3 millimeters 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 so here this slat so size 27 with 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:34.330
 half and here are two planochki size 18 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:37.450
 and a half centimeters so what we begin 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:46.690
 so here in these clan glasses i 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:48.260
 cut a hole somewhere 23 centimeters 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.040
 such 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.500
 in the middle of the neckline and hole for this one 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.170
 hairpin true it should be a little bit 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.240
 so oval see the weight on the round 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.240
 here a bit broken it is not and for 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.800
 what is it then I will say here and and also with 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.490
 the other side was a cutout like that 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.410
 recess hole and here it is 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.310
 recess 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.890
 from this side so we start 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.890
 collect our hacksaw 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.469
 so this planochka is placed in the middle 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.590
 insert the hacksaw blade here and 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:50.470
 we want a tree we want a metal 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.780
 we take here such rivets no matter 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.159
 what do you take this in order to 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:02.980
 kept our canvas but leave 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:06.250
 another hole 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:14.010
 insert the element on our count here 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:18.360
 these holes you see she 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.510
 unevenly parallel then 90 friend 90 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.120
 degrees and slightly tapers at 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.920
 so lest she wedge here we are 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:34.140
 made a hole hired oval 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.209
 so always leave shaybochku and here 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.769
 so here 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.769
 we twist a deaf little nut 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.870
 So 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.510
 now on the other side tight 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.010
 we twist on the other hand we insert 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:15.040
 puck and that's just such a lamb 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:17.939
 cheat on our stud and 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.939
 we clamp 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:30.620
 Click so that this is our canvas 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:35.440
 you need to let go a little bit to the end 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:41.360
 see this one here and this rivet 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.520
 here is the same thing 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.669
 for metal wanted on wood 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.810
 turned over here this canvas will be by 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:54.770
 tree you are very simple 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.080
 rather, it has already once been such 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.010
 hacksaws 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.800
 this is just a converted material 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.440
 which me was it all made of 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.930
 waste 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.910
 if you have something lying around not 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:16.509
 you can throw it away 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:24.680
 here's a tool to do on the ass 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:27.110
 so here we clamp here everything we hope I hope 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.240
 you would like an idea 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.900
