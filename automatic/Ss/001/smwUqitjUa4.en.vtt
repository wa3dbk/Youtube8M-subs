00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hi girls, how are you? Where are you? 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.809
 A really cool tip for you guys in the middle. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.270
 previous I gave the t-shirt tip 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.250
 that 's what the video was. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 with very poor resolution so I 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 I said go and do another one for you more. 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.779
 It is not this is another idea 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
 I had it, what's it to make a shirt? 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 mini 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.649
 so you're going to need a sweater 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.410
 old is preferably white girls 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.200
 which is where it looks most beautiful is white 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 You'll need one like this. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.840
 I even told him in the other one. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.270
 video that is he was a short and I 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 I turned him into this red tie 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.600
 only he does not have white polka dots 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 so we'll make the balls 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.480
 white with the fabric paint are you 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.969
 you will need the ear mold that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.160
 I did copy the internet I spent with the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.100
 paper so you can now print this 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.799
 normal size you will need a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 fabric glue and white and black ink 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.200
 as just for you the ink that uses the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 acrilex but then you will need the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.240
 brush brush the makeup sky 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.540
 for I have shown to you but then I do not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.979
 I still did not have the time to buy 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.829
 This one I bought from Faber 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.590
 castell of number 10 and the brush I 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.750
 I'll get to make the balls. 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 if you have already purchased cloth with 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.540
 ball MalhÃ£o good then girls 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.450
 now you'll get it so I undo 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.180
 The one I already had ready to be able to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.149
 polka dots is on and I got this 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.030
 ink I have is type 1 a pen 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.869
 from ipca to the title to paint the face 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.439
 and then you'll make the balls in it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 It 's more interesting you do before 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:09.530
 the balls will stay like this look makes a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.530
 goal also 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.819
 Good girls, I did it on my watch. 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.519
 only with this is this 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.310
 this facial pen and now I'm going to think 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.650
 with the hardest brush I have 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.349
 which is what I said it bial 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:33.680
 understood that you have been painting and doing 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:37.129
 polka dots on the top not good girls I did 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.409
 also there when you see how 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.930
 It is that it was and then we will leave 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.569
 drying to be able to paint lusa 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.329
 It's okay with the shirt, it's going to be different from 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.890
 people will get the paper the same time as 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.090
 father the same way I made a video 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.970
 For you, the last blouse you see. 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.310
 and then we will always cut the same 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.319
 I said we do the outside part. 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.200
 not the inside 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.420
 so there you have it, cut the knot right 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.790
 and I'm going to use your share of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:18.109
 in the contact here and I go around 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:20.630
 the head of the minc and we now cut it 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.510
 He told you the goal, you'll get the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.419
 mall the mold from inside are and will play 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.970
 out not only get the record 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:35.540
 so you do not get the shirt that you guys 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:38.090
 they will do it she measures it right 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.949
 size and where you want it 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.370
 In this case I find it easier because 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:47.150
 you will measure by the size of the ear 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.230
 then the rest stays on top of each other . 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:56.629
 each handle inlet 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:59.930
 So will we do with that. 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.959
 another in sky that is the d brush 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.859
 then smoke that already has much 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:10.849
 Time I tried with him then not 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:13.669
 take the black ink and I'll make the goal 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:17.419
 I talked to you guys, they'll do it first. 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:19.190
 outside outside inside outside for him not 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.879
 to spot around 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.439
 Ok, we'll do it then. 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:34.569
 hold the part you 'll get to 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:36.639
 make open ink safe where you go 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.129
 to do will start right 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:48.310
 And then you go from inside to 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:51.129
 It was a little for you as you go. 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.580
 to make a handle be a bit of the essence 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:58.110
 has been doing it from the inside out 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.110
 Sorry folks from the outside inside 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.400
 he is a lot of people people are interesting 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.279
 that you wet it before and after you 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.270
 pass it because you risk ink 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.270
 to pass out 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.849
 but something happened a lot at the moment 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.310
 I was painting the dose for you 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.740
 to be able to show it's my battery 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.139
 phone unloaded and my memory 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.810
 I'm so I had to stop everything for 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.030
 I could do that and then the moment I went 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.919
 see had already made her blouse and had no 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.169
 except for none of the videos 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.419
 well I'll show you how to 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.110
 I did this is the end result of the 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.419
 blouse 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.560
 I stopped at the part I show for 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.719
 you 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.780
 the drawing I'm painting to speak 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:16.099
 outside anger and will stay only tackles the 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:21.030
 drawing and there you see and so well of him 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:23.849
 I hit all the way and yola, so it went well 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.069
 Simple, I came back, I did it again and then I 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:28.229
 I made the ribbons and bunny that with glue 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:31.770
 descent when the fabric I use this 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:37.050
 Look, I'll show you. 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.659

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.330
