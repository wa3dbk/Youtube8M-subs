00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.250
 Yura-chan has fallen for two years 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.760
 I'm simmered in food and lost 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:25.140
 Even if you lose many times, you come out many times 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.140
 I think that continuing to do things led to the result 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.890
 Now because it is four years and began to challenge How about Samushiti 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.380
 I really struggled 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.060
 At last we are going to put on this stage 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.060
 It is very glad Yes 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.360
 As a result the cutter was good though 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.900
 Personally 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.610
 I did it at all 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.620
 Other members worked hard 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:12.940
 If you win the team I would be 0 points, but I and is going to take 30 points wonder if ANYTHING over 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.940
 But I think you 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 Nde feeling is strong that that attempt to place Nagoya 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 Because we go as a representative among them 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.940
 I heard various sweets in Nagoya do this 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.930
 Why what born as Nagoya weak to tying People 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.860
 There is no pressure there, but I do not want Nagoya to think this is weak 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.140
 I never at the front of the welcome is that it was waving also play once 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.680
 Playoffs with this team 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:59.360
 Nde after all the results are required in order to evolve from this to your knee for Tokyo 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.810
 Well I think that I want to get involved from the usual practice to get it done 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 I will 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.700
 It's a challenger now 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.000
 Us ow 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.619
 There is nothing other than trying hard 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 I know that it is not so sweet because it is not really a glance 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.200
 I want to be a manager 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.849
 No, I just do my best. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.550
 Of course I think that I want to stick to the result in the mind of the challenger 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.350
 Well, I'm thinking about winning only 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.750
 The mon you do not win that there is no dating 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.750
 Please think of me as video loading Yes
