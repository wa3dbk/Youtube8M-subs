I'm gonna do is I'm going to cut from

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.200 
I'm gonna do is I'm going to cut from
the<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.649> my<00:02:01.799> curve<00:02:02.040> straight<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.759> along

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the top of my curve straight out along

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
the top of my curve straight out along
the<00:02:03.360> edge<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.899> from<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> bottom<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.740> curve

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the edge and from the bottom of my curve

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
the edge and from the bottom of my curve
straight<00:02:05.610> out<00:02:05.790> along<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> edge<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
straight out along the edge so this

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.320 
straight out along the edge so this
piece<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.860> come<00:02:07.890> right<00:02:08.369> off

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.000

alright so there's what I have so far as
you<00:02:16.129> can<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.459> my<00:02:16.610> curve<00:02:16.849> didn't<00:02:17.239> really<00:02:17.450> work

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
you can see my curve didn't really work

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.930 
you can see my curve didn't really work
out<00:02:17.840> how<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> drew<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> line<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.099> it's<00:02:19.310> okay<00:02:19.640> so

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
out how I drew the line but it's okay so

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.119 
out how I drew the line but it's okay so
now<00:02:20.090> since<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.690> took<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:21.049> piece<00:02:21.379> out<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.890> can

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
now since I took this piece out I can

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.830 
now since I took this piece out I can
put<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.400> along<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.879> other<00:02:23.000> side<00:02:23.150> make<00:02:23.690> sure

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
put it along the other side make sure

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.839 
put it along the other side make sure
the<00:02:23.989> front<00:02:24.319> is<00:02:24.530> lined<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.129> and<00:02:25.370> once<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.819> it

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
the front is lined up and once I have it

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.670 
the front is lined up and once I have it
lined<00:02:26.150> up<00:02:26.299> that'll<00:02:26.720> tell<00:02:26.900> me<00:02:27.049> right<00:02:27.379> where<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
lined up that'll tell me right where to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.589 
lined up that'll tell me right where to
draw<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:28.040> line<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.610> I'll<00:02:28.700> take<00:02:28.849> my<00:02:28.910> sharpie<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
draw my line so I'll take my sharpie and

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.059 
draw my line so I'll take my sharpie and
I'll<00:02:29.780> draw<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.080> right<00:02:30.230> along<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.739> curved

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
I'll draw it right along that curved

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.100 
I'll draw it right along that curved
edge<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.940> once<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.269> take<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.629> away<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.049> don't

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
I think when I Seche it I'm just gonna

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.150 
I think when I Seche it I'm just gonna
put<00:04:11.389> a<00:04:11.599> piece<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.870> tape<00:04:12.019> half<00:04:12.470> on<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.889> front

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
put a piece of tape half on the front

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.949 
put a piece of tape half on the front
and<00:04:13.370> half<00:04:13.669> on<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:14.000> table<00:04:14.359> just<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:14.810> it's

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
and half on the table just so it's

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.110 
and half on the table just so it's
smooth<00:04:15.230> writing<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.280> but<00:04:16.549> as<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.000> can

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
smooth writing on to it but as you can

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.029 
smooth writing on to it but as you can
see<00:04:17.180> pretty<00:04:17.660> much<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> full<00:04:18.229> quarter<00:04:18.590> pipe<00:04:18.799> with

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
see pretty much a full quarter pipe with

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.190 
see pretty much a full quarter pipe with
just<00:04:19.250> barely<00:04:19.609> any<00:04:19.940> tape<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.840> think

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
just barely any tape really I think

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.420 
just barely any tape really I think
three<00:04:21.530> pieces

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
three pieces

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.490 
three pieces
pretty<00:04:22.759> cool<00:04:23.000> seems<00:04:23.449> pretty<00:04:23.690> sturdy<00:04:24.110> so

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
pretty cool seems pretty sturdy so

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.439 
pretty cool seems pretty sturdy so
hopefully<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.100> gives<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.430> guys<00:04:25.610> an<00:04:25.789> idea<00:04:26.180> of

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
hopefully this gives you guys an idea of

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.150 
hopefully this gives you guys an idea of
what<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:26.960> can<00:04:27.139> do<00:04:27.289> maybe<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.770> could<00:04:27.949> use<00:04:28.130> a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
what you can do maybe you could use a

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.100 
what you can do maybe you could use a
different<00:04:28.580> size<00:04:28.759> box<00:04:29.150> or<00:04:29.479> make<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.690> different

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
different size box or make a different

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.080 
different size box or make a different
style<00:04:30.320> ramp<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.949> spine<00:04:31.310> ramp<00:04:31.550> would<00:04:31.729> be<00:04:31.850> cool

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
style ramp a spine ramp would be cool

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.029 
style ramp a spine ramp would be cool
but<00:04:32.330> make<00:04:32.570> one<00:04:32.810> take<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.259> picture<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.949> and

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
but make one take a picture of it and

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.740 
but make one take a picture of it and
