00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
never really used it and then I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.810

Sanders I have a couple different sizes

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.830 
Sanders I have a couple different sizes
here<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.369> lot<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.820> times<00:01:24.000> I'll<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.630> my

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
here a lot of times I'll put them in my

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.679 
here a lot of times I'll put them in my
in<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.619> air<00:01:26.549> 90<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> have

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
in my air 90 and use them but I have

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.469 
in my air 90 and use them but I have
this<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.560> router<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.270> cool

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
this this router and I think the cool

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
this this router and I think the cool
thing<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.079> router<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.799> variable

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
thing with this router is it's variable

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.330 
thing with this router is it's variable
speed<00:01:36.049> it's<00:01:37.049> set<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.100> zero

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
speed it's set all the way down to zero

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.240 
speed it's set all the way down to zero
right<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:39.170> these<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.740> rating<00:01:41.130> on

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
right now because these the rating on

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.920 
right now because these the rating on
these<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.610> they're<00:01:42.180> actually<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:42.899> up

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
these you they're actually do go up

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.730 
these you they're actually do go up
twenty<00:01:43.799> twenty-five<00:01:44.430> thousand<00:01:45.030> rpms<00:01:45.710> but<00:01:46.710> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
twenty twenty-five thousand rpms but I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.940 
twenty twenty-five thousand rpms but I
think<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.490> bit<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.759> fast<00:01:48.950> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
think that's a little bit too fast and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.130 
think that's a little bit too fast and
it<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.549> nice<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:50.970> able<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.540> turn<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.960> down

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it was nice to be able to turn it down

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
it was nice to be able to turn it down
with<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> variable<00:01:53.280> speed<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> did<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
with the variable speed so what I did is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.800 
with the variable speed so what I did is

both of them on there at once that way

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.430 
both of them on there at once that way

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.069 
you could take most of the material out
on<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.769> bottom<00:03:48.159> do<00:03:49.000> you're<00:03:49.150> hoggin<00:03:49.540> down<00:03:49.690> here

the record and then this thing here it

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.439 
the record and then this thing here it
stuck<00:04:07.569> out<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:08.109> bit<00:04:08.379> further<00:04:09.340> than<00:04:09.519> the

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
stuck out a little bit further than the

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.719 
stuck out a little bit further than the
6-inch<00:04:10.870> diameter<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:12.069> I<00:04:12.099> had<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.400> make<00:04:12.579> this

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
6-inch diameter so I had to make this

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:14.879 
6-inch diameter so I had to make this
slot<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.389> I<00:04:13.659> did<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:14.019> just<00:04:14.139> with<00:04:14.319> a<00:04:14.349> hole<00:04:14.590> saw

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
slot and I did that just with a hole saw

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.969 
slot and I did that just with a hole saw
and<00:04:15.159> a<00:04:15.760> cut-off<00:04:16.000> wheel<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.750> then<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.769> put<00:04:17.949> a

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
and a cut-off wheel and then I put a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.690 
and a cut-off wheel and then I put a
hole<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.970> backside<00:04:19.539> for<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> switch<00:04:20.829> you

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
hole and the backside for the switch you

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.320 
hole and the backside for the switch you
want<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:21.909> be<00:04:21.969> able<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.330> turn<00:04:22.539> it<00:04:22.690> on<00:04:22.779> and<00:04:22.960> off

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
want to be able to turn it on and off

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.710 
want to be able to turn it on and off
so<00:04:24.080> just<00:04:24.289> put<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.680> here<00:04:26.349> and<00:04:27.349> it<00:04:27.470> sits<00:04:27.770> flush

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
so just put it in here and it sits flush

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.300 
so just put it in here and it sits flush
before<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:29.750> had<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.199> cutout<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.860> wouldn't<00:04:31.129> sit

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
before I had this cutout it wouldn't sit

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.619 
before I had this cutout it wouldn't sit
flush<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:31.879> that's<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.199> then<00:04:33.289> I<00:04:33.440> have<00:04:33.650> uh

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
flush so that's it and then I have uh

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.939 
flush so that's it and then I have uh
I'll<00:04:35.629> take<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.379> show<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.770> shot<00:04:37.039> of<00:04:37.190> this

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
I'll take and show you a shot of this

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.770 
I'll take and show you a shot of this
it's<00:04:39.949> a<00:04:40.099> it's<00:04:40.340> obviously<00:04:41.120> higher<00:04:41.389> than<00:04:41.659> this

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
it's a it's obviously higher than this

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.080 
it's a it's obviously higher than this
Plexiglas<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:43.400> that's<00:04:43.580> why<00:04:43.699> I<00:04:43.729> made<00:04:43.940> this

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
Plexiglas so that's why I made this

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.830 
Plexiglas so that's why I made this
quarter-inch<00:04:45.039> plywood<00:04:46.039> base<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:47.210> I'm<00:04:47.720> going

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
quarter-inch plywood base and I'm going

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.770 
quarter-inch plywood base and I'm going
to<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.990> double<00:04:48.409> side<00:04:48.590> taped<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.569> and<00:04:50.569> I'm<00:04:50.659> going

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
to I double side taped it and I'm going

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.520 
to I double side taped it and I'm going
to<00:04:50.870> stick<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.110> on<00:04:51.289> there<00:04:51.770> Oh<00:04:53.050> got<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.080> visitor

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
to stick that on there Oh got a visitor

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.860 
to stick that on there Oh got a visitor
I'll<00:04:54.740> turn<00:04:55.069> the<00:04:55.159> camera<00:04:55.490> off<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.849> start<00:04:56.690> right

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
I'll turn the camera off and start right

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.469 
I'll turn the camera off and start right
back<00:04:56.990> up<00:04:57.229> okay<00:04:57.639> okay<00:04:58.639> that<00:04:58.849> was<00:04:58.940> my<00:04:58.969> buddy<00:04:59.180> Mike

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
back up okay okay that was my buddy Mike

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.339 
back up okay okay that was my buddy Mike
stopping<00:04:59.840> by<00:04:59.990> I<00:05:00.590> was<00:05:01.370> just<00:05:01.580> ready<00:05:01.759> to<00:05:01.849> put<00:05:02.090> this

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
stopping by I was just ready to put this

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.140 
stopping by I was just ready to put this
just<00:05:03.349> throat<00:05:03.620> plate<00:05:03.889> on<00:05:04.099> I<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.699> use<00:05:04.849> double

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
just throat plate on I just use double

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.230 
just throat plate on I just use double
side<00:05:05.360> tape<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:06.759> made<00:05:07.759> it<00:05:07.849> a<00:05:07.909> little<00:05:08.060> bit

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
side tape and made it a little bit

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.700 
side tape and made it a little bit
bigger<00:05:08.449> than<00:05:08.659> the<00:05:08.870> 2-inch<00:05:09.560> diameter<00:05:14.710> that's

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
bigger than the 2-inch diameter that's

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.180 
bigger than the 2-inch diameter that's
about<00:05:16.069> it

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.180 

so<00:05:21.150> now<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.360> can<00:05:21.660> you<00:05:22.260> take<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.590> piece<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.040> run

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
so now you can you take a piece and run

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.120 
so now you can you take a piece and run
it<00:05:23.370> right<00:05:23.400> up<00:05:23.730> there<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:26.490> alot<00:05:27.200> it's<00:05:28.200> it's

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
it right up there and it alot it's it's

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.970 
it right up there and it alot it's it's
just<00:05:29.490> above<00:05:29.850> this<00:05:30.060> surface<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:30.800> I'm<00:05:31.800> going<00:05:31.920> to

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
just above this surface so I'm going to

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.080 
just above this surface so I'm going to
go<00:05:32.070> ahead<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.340> plug<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.640> in<00:05:32.760> turn<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.150> on<00:05:38.090> the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
go ahead and plug it in turn it on the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.780 
go ahead and plug it in turn it on the
switches<00:05:39.510> back<00:05:39.720> here<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:42.270> it's<00:05:42.420> pretty<00:05:42.570> quiet

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
switches back here so it's pretty quiet

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.210 
switches back here so it's pretty quiet
that's<00:05:44.790> on<00:05:45.060> low<00:05:45.330> there's<00:05:45.780> that's<00:05:46.560> number<00:05:46.830> one

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
that's on low there's that's number one

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.010 
that's on low there's that's number one
it<00:05:47.760> goes<00:05:47.910> all<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.180> way<00:05:48.300> up<00:05:48.420> to<00:05:48.540> six<00:05:48.840> it

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
it goes all the way up to six it

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.470 
it goes all the way up to six it
probably<00:05:49.350> goes<00:05:49.500> all<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.710> way<00:05:49.830> up<00:05:50.010> over<00:05:50.480> 20,000

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
probably goes all the way up over 20,000

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.430 
probably goes all the way up over 20,000
rpms<00:05:52.040> so<00:05:53.040> again<00:05:53.310> this<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.640> just<00:05:53.820> for<00:05:54.590> for<00:05:55.590> minor

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
rpms so again this is just for for minor

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.480 
rpms so again this is just for for minor
adjustments<00:05:58.440> and<00:05:59.330> on<00:06:00.330> these<00:06:00.570> shims<00:06:01.490> sometimes

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
adjustments and on these shims sometimes

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.690 
adjustments and on these shims sometimes
that<00:06:02.760> shim<00:06:03.150> is<00:06:03.890> tapered<00:06:04.890> this<00:06:05.100> way<00:06:05.340> and

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
that shim is tapered this way and

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.720 
that shim is tapered this way and
sometimes<00:06:06.150> it's<00:06:06.810> tapered<00:06:07.320> back<00:06:07.770> this<00:06:08.040> way<00:06:08.310> so

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
sometimes it's tapered back this way so

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.030 
sometimes it's tapered back this way so
it's<00:06:11.730> just<00:06:11.970> in<00:06:12.210> order<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.690> take<00:06:13.620> off<00:06:13.800> some

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
it's just in order to take off some

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.610 
it's just in order to take off some
material<00:06:14.610> off<00:06:14.700> that<00:06:14.730> backside<00:06:15.540> you<00:06:16.320> can<00:06:16.350> just

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
material off that backside you can just

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:24.860 
material off that backside you can just
kind<00:06:16.830> of<00:06:16.980> take<00:06:17.460> it<00:06:17.490> through<00:06:17.820> here<00:06:19.730> like<00:06:20.730> this

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.830 

so<00:06:25.870> that's<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.460> egrets<00:06:27.460> on<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:27.700> bottom<00:06:28.120> 120

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
so that's the egrets on the bottom 120

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.409 
so that's the egrets on the bottom 120
grits<00:06:29.020> on<00:06:29.170> the<00:06:29.260> top

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.149 

so<00:06:32.930> I<00:06:32.960> think<00:06:33.050> it's<00:06:33.289> gonna<00:06:33.379> work<00:06:33.590> well<00:06:33.800> for<00:06:34.069> the

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
so I think it's gonna work well for the

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.570 
so I think it's gonna work well for the
shims<00:06:34.460> if<00:06:35.270> not<00:06:35.800> you<00:06:36.800> know<00:06:36.919> just<00:06:36.949> general

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
shims if not you know just general

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.339 
shims if not you know just general
standing<00:06:38.090> when<00:06:38.240> you're<00:06:38.389> when<00:06:38.930> you're<00:06:38.960> cutting

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
standing when you're when you're cutting

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.380 
standing when you're when you're cutting
in<00:06:39.409> fitting<00:06:39.740> by<00:06:39.860> a<00:06:39.889> boat

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390
