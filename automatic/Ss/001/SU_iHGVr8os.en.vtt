00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 let's talk about July church the church 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 he was 70 years old and of three 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.260
 women women and said it there said that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.759
 had understood that everyone knew 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.670
 that had had a lot of women 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.130
 imagine 3000 women but look 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.529
 he had them told in a track of what 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:27.390
 that I say I already lost the account like this 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 well let's talk about the good church a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.109
 of the things that has most called the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.829
 attention of this concert are your 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.070
 showgirls and tell me that is was 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 spectacular that everything spectacular 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.960
 It was a Brazilian like six feet 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 come once 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's just that and that's not careful 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 because that can help something in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.649
 against his church because they can say 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.980
 which is that they do not treat them well that they do not 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.210
 were his excess of transferred and excess 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.460
 but the public love July churches 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.119
 As I tell you, I saw people crying. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 people who enjoyed it was something incredible 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.170
 The church that confirms that it is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 one of the most Hispanic artists 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
 great of the story I want to tell you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.039
 who is the only Latino artist who has 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 a guinness record for having sold 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.910
 350 million records and July church 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.509
 this Saturday he fell in love with nicaragua 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.860
 he had come in the 70s he had come 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.179
 in love to Nicaragua and these two 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.979
 girls fell in love with our 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.759
 cameraman were there because they were 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.409
 they were left with me 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.740
 only then it shows 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.710
 where these women and I stayed robert 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.289
 anyone shocked were some legs 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 that had no end is Brazilian the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.939
 awesome girl 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.180
 if I went to do a little slow because 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.940
 by rafael is more or less contemporary 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 of what has changed because today 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.210
 the church asked him with this 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.780
 well very well sing very well 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.630
 speak the speech well past is that it is a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.060
 character will be that he does it to fall in love 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.760
 who follows he says that he is very 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.700
 romantic and that's why he's had so many 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.680
 women in your life but I also have 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.590
 reactions from the people I should listen to 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.230

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.300
