00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.270 

this<00:03:35.110> this<00:03:36.110> would<00:03:36.320> have<00:03:36.410> worked<00:03:36.560> Venice<00:03:39.280> this

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
this this would have worked Venice this

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.220 
this this would have worked Venice this
would<00:03:40.490> have<00:03:40.580> worked<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.850> lot<00:03:41.000> better<00:03:41.330> how<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.690> do

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
would have worked a lot better how to do

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.940 
would have worked a lot better how to do
it<00:03:42.470> Otacon<00:03:43.280> actually<00:03:43.880> been<00:03:44.150> there<00:03:44.770> but<00:03:45.770> here

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
it Otacon actually been there but here

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.680 
it Otacon actually been there but here
this<00:03:46.130> is<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.640> accurate<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.090> he's<00:03:47.330> talking<00:03:47.540> to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
this is so accurate that he's talking to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:04:01.020 
this is so accurate that he's talking to
her<00:03:47.780> through<00:03:47.960> a<00:03:48.020> machine

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:20.509 

yeah<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.240> rest<00:04:02.570> for<00:04:02.660> me<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:14.380> hate<00:04:15.380> receive

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:29.520 

beautiful<00:04:21.519> eyes

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.050 

yeah<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:32.630> is<00:04:32.780> some<00:04:32.960> live<00:04:33.140> music<00:04:33.910> wearing<00:04:34.910> out

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
yeah this is some live music wearing out

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.970 
yeah this is some live music wearing out
my<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.420> you

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.190 

I<00:04:43.420> think<00:04:44.420> it<00:04:44.510> would<00:04:44.660> have<00:04:44.750> been<00:04:44.780> better<00:04:45.050> had

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
I think it would have been better had

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.410 
I think it would have been better had
they<00:04:45.770> done<00:04:46.220> something<00:04:46.400> different

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
they done something different

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.840 
they done something different
a<00:04:48.450> second<00:04:49.170> person<00:04:49.350> he'd<00:04:50.070> fall<00:04:50.310> in<00:04:50.490> love<00:04:50.670> with

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
a second person he'd fall in love with

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.060 
a second person he'd fall in love with
in<00:04:51.030> two<00:04:51.240> hours<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.930> think<00:04:52.680> we<00:04:52.770> would<00:04:52.950> have<00:04:52.980> been

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
in two hours I think we would have been

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.950 
in two hours I think we would have been
better<00:04:53.670> if<00:04:53.850> yet<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.360> different<00:04:54.660> kind<00:04:54.870> of

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
better if yet to the different kind of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.140 
better if yet to the different kind of
attacks<00:04:55.260> first<00:04:55.920> second<00:04:56.730> time<00:04:56.880> he<00:04:56.970> was<00:04:57.090> a

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
attacks first second time he was a

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.940 
attacks first second time he was a
family

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
family

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.620 
family

you know now that you put this in slow

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.250 
you know now that you put this in slow
motion<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.670> looks<00:05:28.750> ridiculous

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.560 

slow<00:05:33.260> motion<00:05:33.500> Clips<00:05:33.980> it<00:05:34.190> puts<00:05:34.670> your<00:05:34.820> eyes<00:05:35.270> onto

slow motion Clips it puts your eyes onto

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.530 
slow motion Clips it puts your eyes onto

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
details so it really doesn't work for a

details so it really doesn't work for a
seat<00:05:38.780> where<00:05:38.990> there's
