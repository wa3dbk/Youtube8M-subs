00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 to those who are going to live in their home I 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.069
 would recommend laying hens 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.719
 my wife and I are city dwellers therefore 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 you asked a lot 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 and learned before you start your 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 chickens and we decided to start laying hens only 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.390
 after two years of living my home where 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.880
 buy on the market take two three 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.960
 monthly forms depending on age 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.970
 they are 30 percent more expensive 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 for example, two-month-old chickens were sold at 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.890
 250 rubles and three months for 350 rubles 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.770
 take babies chickens curtains i don't 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 advise medium is very large will fall 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.899
 rats birds all love to eat 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.879
 babes and let you think that rats have 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 you are not there but still better to take 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 adult chickens what breed to the most 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.469
 unpretentious of those that can be found on 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.840
 meat breeds or layers 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.230
 we chose layers as we need 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.110
 there were eggs how much time and chickens rush 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 they start to bear from six months and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 ends in about a year when 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.290
 them begins shedding they simply 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 begin to lose feathers than to feed the chickens 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 one chicken eats one hundred grams of feed in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.130
 day we give the hens all the leftovers from 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 of the table 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.479
 all that we donâ€™t consider ourselves eating for us 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.790
 chickens 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.420
 we usually buy a bag of wheat or 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 oats with this and feed the wheat you can eat 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 and for example about roschin only 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.229
 The problem with feed is that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 granules possible pen parasites that with 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.479
 by lightning speed eat up the whole group for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.430
 to prevent this from happening to the circle 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.820
 parts put in freezer cyprus 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.630
 orange bugs that die when 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.640
 -15 degrees as needed 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.469
 for chicken 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.930
 This question we not investigated in our 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.670
 the case has already been a condo to from previous 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.940
 the owners in her chickens and lived there did 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.940
 roost and carry eggs only 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.580
 what we did is teach them to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.190
 this smoke 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.350
 that is when they hid at night 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.110
 anywhere any corner we them 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.530
 carried a chicken coop after a while they 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.440
 accustomed to their place 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.380
 how much of a day does a chicken usually carry 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.020
 one egg a day exception during 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.630
 cold weather at this time they are constantly sitting 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.210
 in the hen house don't leave him because 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.460
 that the paws are cold during the cold weather 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.260
 need to hang a light bulb which 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.930
 would give light and heat 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.340
 what to do with chickens after they 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.250
 stopped rushing the answer is obvious in the soup 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.800
 However, I do not have much skill deprivation 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.810
 the lives of chickens although I had to once 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.350
 pluck the chicken that my crush 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.590
 dog 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.490
 however, I gave my chickens to the village with 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:13.650
 to my friend 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:13.650
 he mini blanket ceremonies like that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.860
 above I climbed stupidly jumping here to jump 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.860
 there 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.550
 here it will be from there in general here and not 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:37.069
 kept like this some years showing 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.440
 how hard it is to keep chickens in their own way 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.069
 experience I can say that absolutely not 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.500
 tense need to do in seoul 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.630
 fences for them and everything can be done 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.430
 something like cells that can 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.750
 move the city so that they 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.209
 plucked the roots of the bugs and the ground if 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.060
 you decided to live in your house then 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.650
 necessarily along with the greenhouse of sood 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.650
 get laying hens
