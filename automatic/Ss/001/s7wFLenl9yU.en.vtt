00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
Starting school is a major event in the life
of children and their families.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.530
And it's made easier when information is shared
between families, early childhood services

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.300
and schools.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.940
This can help build strong relationships and
ensure

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.170
a smooth transition to school.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.720
A good transition means children start school
ready to learn

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.679
and schools are better prepared.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.060
The new Transition to School Statement will
make the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.260
process even smoother.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.040
The statement offers for the first time a
common format for

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.160
early childhood educators and families to
provide important

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970
information to schools about the children
entering

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.520
their Kindergarten classes.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.750
Parents will have the opportunity to provide
their perspective

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.790
on their child's early learning and development
and children, too, will have the chance to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.690
give their own input.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.010
Early childhood educators will take the lead
in

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.220
completing the Statement, in cooperation with
families.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
The statement helps close the gap between
primary school education

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.850
and the early childhood education.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.109
I guess it's meaningful relationships not
just with the child,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.670
the family, but also that partnership with
the school.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.130
So that child is walking into an environment
that they're aware

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.009
of and feel a sense of belonging to.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.969
Use of the statement is entirely voluntary
but

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.750
early childhood educators, teachers and families
can all benefit by taking part.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.520
It made me feel more confident with him going
to school.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.810
He seemed ready - he knew what it was about.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.689
He'd met his teachers.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:47.810
They knew about him.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.789
They were both on day one ... they were ready
to go.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.389
The statement will provide us with really
useful information

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:56.619
for our classroom teachers.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.369
It will give information about their social
and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.639
emotional development, and it will complement
the Best Start

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.200
we do at the beginning of the year so that
we'll have a picture

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.030
of the whole child and how we can have a positive
start to their school career.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.510
The statement includes a summary of the child's
strengths,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.870
their interests and approaches to learning.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.940
With the family's permission, the completed
statement will be

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.700
forwarded to the child's intended school
by their early childhood educator.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.430
If families prefer, they can choose to forward
the Statement

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.450
on to the school themselves.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.030
