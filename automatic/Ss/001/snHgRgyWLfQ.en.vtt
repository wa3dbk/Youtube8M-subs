00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.349 
what this crazy rig is that I'm bringing
out<00:00:04.020> when<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.470> play<00:00:04.650> with<00:00:04.770> my<00:00:04.859> band<00:00:05.040> lately<00:00:05.460> I've

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
been using 50 watt plexi Hoffman and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.650 
been using 50 watt plexi Hoffman and
also<00:00:10.920> I've<00:00:11.010> been<00:00:11.130> using<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.700> tube<00:00:12.300> spring

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
also I've been using my tube spring

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.169 
also I've been using my tube spring
reverb<00:00:12.870> Hoffman<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:13.889> well<00:00:14.130> into<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> 50<00:00:15.000> watt

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
reverb Hoffman as well into the 50 watt

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.599 
reverb Hoffman as well into the 50 watt
into<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> 4:12<00:00:15.900> evidence<00:00:16.289> cab<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.310> I've<00:00:17.430> been

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
into a 4:12 evidence cab and I've been

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.340 
into a 4:12 evidence cab and I've been
short<00:00:17.820> me<00:00:18.090> I've<00:00:18.300> been<00:00:18.449> reducing<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> amount

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
short me I've been reducing the amount

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.630 
short me I've been reducing the amount
of<00:00:19.410> effects<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.189> gonna<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.609> of

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
of effects I use I'm gonna do a lot of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.849 
of effects I use I'm gonna do a lot of
looping<00:00:20.970> when<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.150> played<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> band<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.529> I

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
looping when I played with the band so I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.519 
looping when I played with the band so I
use<00:00:23.570> basically<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> Chandler<00:00:25.050> tube<00:00:25.260> driver

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
use basically a Chandler tube driver

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.550 
use basically a Chandler tube driver
then<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.730> one<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.539> these<00:00:27.689> two<00:00:27.900> fuzz<00:00:28.140> faces

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
then I use one of these two fuzz faces

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.550 
then I use one of these two fuzz faces
either<00:00:28.710> use<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> 69<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> original<00:00:31.349> fuzz

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
either use the 69 all the original fuzz

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.459 
either use the 69 all the original fuzz
or<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.340> Eric<00:00:32.579> Johnson<00:00:32.790> fuzz<00:00:33.180> face<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.719> then

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
or the Eric Johnson fuzz face and then

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.970 
or the Eric Johnson fuzz face and then
into<00:00:35.460> an<00:00:35.790> analog<00:00:36.120> delay<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> just

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
into an analog delay so here is just

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.700 
into an analog delay so here is just
just<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.480> Hoffman<00:00:39.899> tube<00:00:40.110> spring<00:00:40.469> reverb

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just the the Hoffman tube spring reverb

00:00:40.710 --> 00:04:27.060 
just the the Hoffman tube spring reverb
in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> 50<00:00:41.579> watt

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.249 

and<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.759> two<00:04:27.940> driver<00:04:28.210> at<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.449> same<00:04:28.690> time<00:04:28.960> I

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
and the two driver at the same time I

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.770 
and the two driver at the same time I
don't<00:04:29.500> know<00:04:29.560> if<00:04:29.650> he's
