00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.579
 we've all heard about the kioto protocol and the effect gases 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.579
 greenhouse 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.609
 to put it in a way 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279
 simple he knew 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.500
 are three components of many products commonly used m in our homes 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.250
 as they are insecticides and air fresheners cosmetic products 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.050
 in cleaning products and naturally paints 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.190
 these compounds that pass through room to air in their so in the usual use of 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.410
 these products 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.020
 react with other pollutants that can produce adverse effects for the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 environment 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.280
 long time research teams titan industries 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.430
 work with criteria of sustainability the now towards seems legal imperative 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700
 from the regulations to little 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.740
 that we get to work on more products for stuart resources with the medium 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.090
 environment is not only working on the reduction of CO2 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 but the entire life cycle of the product is analyzed 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 from its design the selection of materials 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.040
 the productive process 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.130
 and its characteristics of this application and durability even sun to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190
 the disappearance as a resident 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.270
 but what I can tell you is that the titan paintings will also keep 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 its quality standards the ecology is a value this way 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830
 and therefore a powerful sales argument 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.060
 we should not be fooled 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.920
 it is goodness 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.990
 with the environment of a product is not an easy thing to value 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.590
 the report 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.260
 it is a parameter it is simply the one that indicates the contamination what we can 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 make the air but we do not talk about it or the water in consumption 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.709
 energetic 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.149
 therefore it does not mean that a product that is 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.709
 the bass in the mouth 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.769
 water paint does not have to be 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.889
 ecological 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.059
 I would even say that in some cases 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:27.159
 can be jackson - ecological than a painting the base of san pedro 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.459
 a painting to be green must meet a series of requirements 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.739
 rather more extensive than the mere fact of being formed with water 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.580
 in the criteria of ecology are very broad cell people we have to see the 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 air pollution water pollution waste 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:51.049
 the durability of the product you have is not the same as having to repaint the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.259
 year every year at three years the pollution that generate emotional 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.849
 different you have to analyze more a painting owns the water is not safe 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.439
 Any normal paint to be on the market must comply with the legislation 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.619
 valid 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.119
 this vogue regulation 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.949
 the content of dangerous substances all applicable regulations the 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.789
 titan green line the green line in addition voluntarily 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:24.039
 complies with all a series of requirements of character per hundred content of 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.999
 formulation 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.999
 and of technical characteristics of application 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.019
 are listed in the specifications of the eco-label 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.109
 European the European Ecolabel or the judge and that 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:41.709
 It's a voluntary distinction that products that comply with a 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.949
 specifications that add environmental values ​​to the product 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.009
 to obtain this certification 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:53.089
 The company and the product must be subject to audits by a 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.769
 competent official body 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.500
 which gives a guarantee to the consumer I'm sure not at least in a 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.120
 near future the paintings to the viewer in which they still have an important role 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.219
 both in decoration and in protection 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.650
 yes it is true that paints or solvents what will be on the market in 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:14.519
 the year 2010 and 2012 will be very different from those in ten 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.979
 years ago painting is associated with humanity from the beginning of the 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.460
 times and we naturally believe that this will continue to be 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.990
 we will continue to see hand in hand is more in a society that is changing and 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.590
 is becoming aware 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.500
 that is necessary 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.930
 reduce the consumption 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.970
 take a more sustainable habits is 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.379
 the painting must be in accordance with it and I think it will have a very important role in 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.020
 the next few years especially because in two fields in the protection of 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.890
 materials 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.990
 and in energy saving win to us this is a future 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.949
 quintana 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.410
 continue to work 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.340
 to end something
