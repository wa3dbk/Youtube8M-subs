we live in a world where we feel a
constant<00:00:10.349> pressure<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.800> achieve<00:00:10.889> success<00:00:11.690> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
constant pressure to achieve success and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.709 
constant pressure to achieve success and
we<00:00:12.780> wonder<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.190> track<00:00:14.719> well

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
we wonder we on the right track well

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.689 
we wonder we on the right track well
what<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.289> true<00:00:16.470> success<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.310> how<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.609> we

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
what is true success and how do we

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.420 
what is true success and how do we
attain<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.180> let<00:00:18.810> me<00:00:18.840> tell<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> story<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.619> had

mean I'm here for an hour I have five
days<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> week<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.920> every<00:00:53.250> machine<00:00:53.539> doing

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
days a week I do every machine doing

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
days a week I do every machine doing
machines<00:00:54.960> don't<00:00:55.079> matter<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.160> amount<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
machines don't matter it's the amount of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.279 
machines don't matter it's the amount of
weights<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.000> matter<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> machine

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
weights that matter you go to a machine

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
weights that matter you go to a machine
and<00:00:58.770> lift<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.670> same<00:00:59.969> amount<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> weight<00:01:00.539> as

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and lift the same amount of weight as

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420 
and lift the same amount of weight as
the<00:01:00.840> person<00:01:01.109> before<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.129> working

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the person before you you're not working

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
the person before you you're not working
your<00:01:02.550> muscles<00:01:02.760> you're<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.660> aerobics<00:01:04.170> for

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
your muscles you're doing aerobics for

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.130 
your muscles you're doing aerobics for
your<00:01:04.500> arms<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> legs<00:01:05.129> here's<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> rule<00:01:06.450> when

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
your arms and legs here's the rule when

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
your arms and legs here's the rule when
you<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.380> repetitions<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.280> last<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you do repetitions the last we have to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
you do repetitions the last we have to
kill<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.780> don't<00:01:10.290> your<00:01:10.740> muscles<00:01:11.159> don't

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
kill if they don't your muscles don't

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
kill if they don't your muscles don't
grow<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:12.540> simplify<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> process<00:01:13.799> there

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
grow to over simplify the process there

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
grow to over simplify the process there
are<00:01:14.729> micro<00:01:15.060> fibers<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.689> muscles<00:01:16.140> when

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
are micro fibers in your muscles when

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.289 
are micro fibers in your muscles when
you<00:01:16.590> lift<00:01:16.830> weights<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> live<00:01:17.850> enough

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you lift weights you have to live enough

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
you lift weights you have to live enough
weight<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.439> tear<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> fibers<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:21.090> rest<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
weight to tear the fibers with rest and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570 
weight to tear the fibers with rest and
protein<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> muscles<00:01:22.680> rebuild<00:01:22.979> stronger<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
protein the muscles rebuild stronger and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.429 
protein the muscles rebuild stronger and
larger<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.390> lift<00:01:24.600> heavier<00:01:24.990> weights<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
larger then you lift heavier weights and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
larger then you lift heavier weights and
the<00:01:25.740> process<00:01:26.159> repeats<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.270> said<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.170> what's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the process repeats so I said so what's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
the process repeats so I said so what's
the<00:01:28.470> correct<00:01:28.799> way<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> lift<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.060> he<00:01:30.119> said

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the correct way to lift and he said

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
the correct way to lift and he said
that's<00:01:30.420> exactly<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> point<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.860> no

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that's exactly the point there is no

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370 
that's exactly the point there is no
correct<00:01:32.310> weight<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:33.150> depends<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> person

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
correct weight it depends on the person

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
correct weight it depends on the person
the<00:01:35.040> only<00:01:35.490> thing<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.880> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> worry<00:01:36.329> about

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the only thing you need to worry about

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.680 
the only thing you need to worry about
is<00:01:36.750> whether<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> last<00:01:37.890> kill

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
is whether the last kill

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.560 
is whether the last kill
Cayla<00:01:39.990> somebody<00:01:40.560> else<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:42.120> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Cayla somebody else it's about you and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.280 
Cayla somebody else it's about you and
your<00:01:42.630> muscles<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:44.100> can't<00:01:44.460> fool<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.390> body<00:01:45.600> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
your muscles you can't fool your body in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.210 
your muscles you can't fool your body in
life<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.700> two<00:01:47.910> types<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.300> success

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
life there are two types of success

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.760 
life there are two types of success
horizontal<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.430> vertical<00:01:51.330> each<00:01:52.260> day<00:01:52.590> we

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
horizontal and vertical each day we

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
horizontal and vertical each day we
