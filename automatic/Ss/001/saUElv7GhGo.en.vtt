00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.000
 well with google compatriots I grew up 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.430
 dear Spartans of my channel we are 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.810
 here in a new video guide and it's going to be 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.119
 more than anything a kind of breakthrough 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.210
 informative in which I want to show you 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.760
 for all egg classes a 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 advantages that will add us the level 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.040
 92 to 98 are going to be as we go 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.590
 climbing even levels of level 92 94 96 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.480
 98 where are we going we're going to go 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.270
 acquiring up to a maximum of four 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.400
 Improved skills is good for our 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.680
 character is as you see here in the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.199
 index you see here all the images of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.559
 hunter dance class 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.629
 magician is ok then he can explain in the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.140
 image of each class to pass the video 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.510
 forward and be able to read the four 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.820
 improvements that you will acquire as you go 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.159
 raising the level those even levels that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.840
 I told you earlier it's worth 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.050
 I mean with character improvements 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.260
 how do you remember 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.680
 if they have not been playing for a long time 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.180
 that I explain more when we went 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.760
 an expansion to others like for example 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.520
 from the climax tasting to the pandaria vale 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.840
 well those levels that you had to climb 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.370
 for example from 85 to 90 worth they acquired 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.770
 new skills that came to you in the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.500
 spell book this time to 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.570
 use instead of adding skills 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.600
 new in these 10 levels what are going to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.050
 do is improve the skills already 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.470
 existing and these improvements as the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.830
 we will be acquiring then that at level 92 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.670
 at level 94 to level 96 the level 98 and 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.710
 are going to be randomly for example the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.440
 improvements of a tour and balance two 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.240
 of which are that you have a surge 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 of instant stars or that by 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.520
 example you have every time you have 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.010
 you get hurt at a probability that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.440
 your next 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.560
 he made himself of salvation or of the year be it 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.170
 instant launch then I want 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.540
 say as for example yes 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.849
 you are with a partner you are living 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.130
 together on two wounds equilibrium 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.080
 as they have level 92 remain in the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.080
 instantaneous stars unit and you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.730
 fellow give you that when you take damage 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.130
 has the possibility of launching a 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.890
 action or instant damage notification 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.970
 but hey, it does not take away from you 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.760
 to simply remove that you for example 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 the same instead of receiving it to 92 equal 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.820
 you get them to 94 to 96 do not go to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.690
 to lose simply is that you're going to go 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.750
 acquiring the skills 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.620
 randomly 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.720
 what else can I tell you, because little else 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.900
 true 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.170
 would put a list of all the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.480
 improvements of all kinds and well then 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.730
 I hope you like the video you give to the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.090
 favorites and we achieve in our next 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.090
 video 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.960
 yes 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.940
 uy 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.500
 I think 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.820
 6 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:10.830
 in this way we make good pressure on 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.830
 an external presence 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.260
 It is also to occupy 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.040
 Y 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.040
 yes

 yes 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.890
 yes 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.680
 s 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.889
 A) Yes 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.250
 Yes Yes
