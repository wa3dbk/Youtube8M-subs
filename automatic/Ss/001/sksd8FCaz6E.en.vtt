00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 go hi everyone is dark 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.880
 raptors today have shown a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.460
 tutorial on a watermelon factory in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.210
 pumpkins and automatic 100% 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 automatic 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.449
 so since just now about 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.910
 play on break and I left a little 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.519
 less than an hour anyway if a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.570
 hour still happiness and we had everything 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.570
 that already so in fact it's still 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.130
 it's not 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.050
 yes this compact to lorp between here I 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.580
 tell you something is not an object 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.379
 to make one side we can do like 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.910
 the other side I'll have if we put the earth 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.820
 watermelon and the same system that has 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.410
 behind you can do it twice 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.720
 same side 1 voice is a side papus 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.570
 spaces space and here we go 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.890
 directly attacked the tutorial like that 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.440
 after actually done at the same time 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.470
 the explanation is like that the video is 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.210
 shorter for you so we go 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.310
 start I already explain to you I got 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.600
 that in a block 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.720
 so in fact you have your thumbs of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.790
 pumpkin or watermelons 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.010
 you have above your robot sites 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.070
 blue pistons that are not 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.860
 pantyhose making it here below you 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.500
 have your pistons flowing in fact he 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.560
 will push the earth that will destroy the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.330
 watermelon or pumpkin that goes next 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.950
 the system will trigger the pistent the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.480
 piston that will push it into the waters 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.460
 afraid that they are all headed in this 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.270
 body and so that is then c or fear 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.920
 are directed towards the very end and you 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.050
 have a very important part 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.680
 lacie coat and machining wanted to spread it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.620
 until far enough finally is enough 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.450
 remote and then you have the side the 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.580
 most important of this factory 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.950
 then this plant can be buried 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:11.140
 because I'm rather advised 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.120
 the kitchen pinched I forgot are finally 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.049
 this is a factory to use 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.819
 solar panels the problem of a 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.780
 solar panel is we are not 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.830
 parties at all 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.239
 this stuff under the ground finally above in 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.160
 the tunes and a solar panel that's 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.549
 not enough seeing as well as they want 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.230
 do something that's not too much 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.209
 like that so we will use I got 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.640
 also advise a lot of the system of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.840
 minecraft is proud that they use 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.459
 finally the watermelon finally I'm using 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.860
 many of my clerk's systems I 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.120
 inspires me a lot and where the young little 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.610
 lag is actually the block and conductive 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.620
 the watermelon and conductive you go 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.840
 see here it is less turgid and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.370
 we will use of that so how these 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.660
 tutorials for the explanation then you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.940
 go put opr that are directed 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.489
 to the chest that goes down and hop you 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:13.450
 have the chest underneath you put 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:18.609
 your repeaters stop stone which is in 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.329
 face over a dingo scared and the same 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.739
 for the repeater so then of course 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.810
 you have to block on January 15th 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.950
 you put a piston on the other side 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.970
 for it to be conductive with the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.150
 bristol 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.540
 then another another torch 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.889
 then you are the corner of finally doing 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.730
 driving and block 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:45.750
 you will then send 3 tic 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:50.169
 tell it three tic here you go to put 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.940
 art is stone for it to be active and 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.549
 then a repeater that she is finally 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.639
 you leave the normal alain tic and 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.609
 So here beyond the top we ended 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:04.090
 push so for example if that's it 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:08.109
 pushes it makes the rsa to yes thanks we did not 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:13.329
 not made the system the sail chips 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.979
 wait, we'll do like that, you 'll 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.280
 you saw that it would do something 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:21.220
 like that 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 so then we'll put a block in 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.620
 below da repeater torch is 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.009
 passed torch excuse me are pcc this 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.630
 torch 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:40.590
 then you have m 2 a block to reston 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:43.389
 with 2.2 all two torches hooked 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:49.840
 then you go to torch this torch 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:51.699
 left barley with pistons and that's it and 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.940
 then on the other side of the side of 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.400
 sides it's going to walk next I heard 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.570
 foot then then you 'll put some 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.389
 right side you have to do some sort of 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.610
 diagonal one side calais to a tick by 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.520
 against that's how important it is 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.960
 because here there is a repeater so a 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.770
 tic 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.419
 then what are you going to take a 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.560
 other repeaters you will put some 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.340
 those on the east coast we're going to do a 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.889
 torch lift up 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.220
 so that's it with gore just two 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:25.750
 torches and then a reston and the 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:28.150
 torch and that's it and that's all has been 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.470
 pushed to lead together was lost that 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.130
 on the other hand and it's good 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.750
 it worked out so then well 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.240
 little important part if they wanted 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.699
 put a block metting houston especially 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.729
 do not lie a full houston organ blog 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.800
 or a slab or an object that is not 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.410
 a flat block otherwise he'll drive and 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.410
 with the upper block and it will not 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.759
 do it and so here is the blue 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.530
 stone is very important to rate it 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.990
 for that pushes twice as fast and 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.699
 of course here if you want to avoid face 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.199
 he wanted to do something other than that 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:03.540
 to push already shooting puts this 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.660
 assembly in addition 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.440
 and then well if you want to reduce the 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.700
 naked the brightness for this block because 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.510
 in fact then there is the light plus the 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.160
 block pushed fast 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.080
 that's what I noticed 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.360
 you remove that block there you replace 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.220
 by a solid block like that I took some 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.120
 block of quarks because it's white and 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:28.350
 it's good and here is lot 1 well 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.790
 sure and then as soon as it grows up to 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:35.129
 by in it of course we do some 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:37.860
 losses not very important it's okay 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:41.759
 and here is a finish study of succession 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.470
 and thank you very much and see you next time 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.910
 you really liked this video 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.110
 like and subscribe you his ferrari wrong even 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.690
 rather the opposite 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.580
 I was pretty happy here so how 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.970
 you're going to see strictly there I put 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.970
 a small roof 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.340
 and that's so 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.340
 the afp 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.410
 ciao
