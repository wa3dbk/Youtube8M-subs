00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.380 
so different torques I mean obviously it
looks<00:00:32.470> kind<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.710> junky<00:00:33.130> right<00:00:33.310> now<00:00:33.490> without

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
looks kind of junky right now without

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.300 
looks kind of junky right now without
any<00:00:34.720> paint<00:00:35.140> or<00:00:35.290> anything<00:00:35.500> on<00:00:35.680> it<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:35.950> yes<00:00:36.130> some

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
of the pieces still require detail and a

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.940 
of the pieces still require detail and a
lot<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.100> attention<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.700> stuff<00:00:39.910> like<00:00:40.060> that<00:00:40.300> but

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
not a lot but a little bit so just sort

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
not a lot but a little bit so just sort
of<00:00:45.550> recapping<00:00:46.180> some<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.510> things<00:00:46.780> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.080 

there's<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:51.070> exhaust<00:00:51.489> fans<00:00:51.700> gonna<00:00:51.880> go<00:00:52.030> on

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
there's that exhaust fans gonna go on

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:10.120 
there's that exhaust fans gonna go on
there<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.360> may<00:00:52.480> remember<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:52.870> one

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.010 

so<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:10.939> various<00:01:11.390> different<00:01:11.720> sorts<00:01:11.960> of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
so just various different sorts of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.670 
so just various different sorts of
pieces<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:13.580> chemical<00:01:14.090> plant<00:01:14.659> refine<00:01:15.470> or

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
pieces the chemical plant refine or

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.149 
pieces the chemical plant refine or
anything<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:16.040> came<00:01:17.000> out<00:01:17.180> very<00:01:17.920> bizarrely<00:01:18.920> with

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
anything I came out very bizarrely with

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.310 
anything I came out very bizarrely with
a<00:01:19.190> twisty<00:01:19.670> pipe<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.180> weird<00:01:20.659> angle<00:01:21.170> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
a twisty pipe and that weird angle and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.590 
a twisty pipe and that weird angle and
stuff<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:21.710> there<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.119> that's<00:01:23.119> all<00:01:23.360> good<00:01:23.570> I

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
stuff on there but that's all good I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.330 
stuff on there but that's all good I
mean<00:01:23.780> that's<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.080> way<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.229> should<00:01:24.440> be

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.310 

again<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:32.180> just<00:01:32.299> keeping<00:01:32.630> with<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.840> basic

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
again I'm just keeping with the basic

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.130 
again I'm just keeping with the basic
sort<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.650> theme<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.490> go<00:01:34.670> nuts

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
sort of theme and you can go nuts

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.820 
sort of theme and you can go nuts
especially<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.320> just<00:01:36.470> talk<00:01:36.619> about

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
especially when you just talk about

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.380 
especially when you just talk about
detailing<00:01:37.369> with<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.820> sort<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.030> stuff<00:01:38.240> which

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
detailing with this sort of stuff which

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.080 
detailing with this sort of stuff which
I'll<00:01:38.570> do<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.770> videos<00:01:40.460> coming<00:01:40.729> up<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.000> a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
I'll do in the videos coming up in a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.359 
I'll do in the videos coming up in a
short<00:01:41.299> time<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.619> we<00:01:42.710> start<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.070> talk<00:01:43.340> about

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
short time and we start to talk about

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.120 
short time and we start to talk about
using<00:01:43.930> prefabricated<00:01:44.930> foam<00:01:45.710> packaging

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
using prefabricated foam packaging

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.800 
using prefabricated foam packaging
pieces<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.820> how<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.060> can<00:01:47.150> me<00:01:47.270> embellish<00:01:47.780> it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
pieces and how it can me embellish it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.630 
pieces and how it can me embellish it
and<00:01:47.990> make<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.009> look<00:01:49.159> not<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.420> foamy<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:52.399> we<00:01:52.490> can

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
and make it look not so foamy and we can

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.240 
and make it look not so foamy and we can
do<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.090> lot<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.600> with<00:01:53.780> thin<00:01:54.619> card<00:01:54.950> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
do that a lot of that with thin card and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.499 
do that a lot of that with thin card and
plastic<00:01:55.640> art<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.090> stuff<00:01:56.240> like<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:58.509> thin

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
plastic art and stuff like that thin

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.910 
plastic art and stuff like that thin
kind<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.840> work<00:01:59.990> fine<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.530> don't<00:02:00.680> need<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.830> go

kind of work fine you don't need to go

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.460 
kind of work fine you don't need to go
out<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.100> buy<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> plastic<00:02:01.700> card<00:02:02.380> that's<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470
