00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.259
 what is cataract 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.879
 cataract corresponds to opacification of the lens on 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.899
 crystalline is an anticipation inside the back eye of 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:30.699
 lyricism 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.670
 is intended to focus the light rays on the central part of the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.370
 retina 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.199
 it plays somehow the same role as a camera lens 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.730
 gradual decline in sight 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.830
 feeling of fog in front of the eyes 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.830
 dazzling in bright light color vision disorders such 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.210
 are the first symptoms of cataracts 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.940
 this condition is due to the development of opacity on the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.700
 crystalline 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.370
 the transparent lens that allows the communication its opacities one prevents 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.090
 the light rays to pass causing a decrease in vision 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.140
 which can be very important 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.440
 the only treatment and resort to surgery is to remove the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.720
 crystalline lens become opaque and to replace it with an implant the operation of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.909
 cataract has become the most common surgical procedure among 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.900
 older people the technique is now well mastered and the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.829
 Results are in the vast majority of cases very satisfactory. 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.619
 it can be performed under general anesthesia or local he 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.100
 therefore there is no age limit to its use quite the contrary because the 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.849
 restoration of a satisfactory vision often allows people to 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.510
 regain some autonomy 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.440
 Before cataract surgery, a complete examination of the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.790
 watch additional exams are essential 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.330
 using cumulating not strong in so many other themes the shale will examine 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.880
 your eye and determine the degree of pacification of the crystal 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.660
 thanks to this first exam your talent logistep will have a complete view of 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.659
 the state of your opinion 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.020
 thanks to lyon and the masters the ophthalmologist will measure different 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.599
 parameters of your eye 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.179
 whose axial length 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.849
 in order to determine the most suitable power to implement it 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.849
 use it during cataract surgery 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:27.609
 using hiv santos was a tomograph the optical coherence your 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.799
 ophthalmologist will check the status of your corner 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.769
 as well as the Korean thickness 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.789
 this very simple and contactless exam ap is absolutely not painful 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.739
 a review done with the company status will allow 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.699
 Ophthalmology stage check the condition of your retina and your macular 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.920
 for cataract surgery 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.439
 the technique most often use you l 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.780
 extra capsular action of the crystal a small incision and realized in the 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.939
 cornea then the nucleus of the crystalline lens and remove 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.499
 leaving the capsule in place this intervention and usually 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:22.719
 realized today by a method called sakho and lucie fication on 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.340
 crystalline and it is necessary to increase in small pieces by ultrasounds 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.589
 and then inspired through a tiny incision 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:33.779
 after installation of the patient in the operating room the instrumentation table 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.599
 would have prepared the microscope in focus 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.949
 souza local anesthesia or simply by anesthetic eye drops the intervention 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.769
 begins with a sixth Korean to access the previous chamber of 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:45.230
 the ouch 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.939
 an ultrasound probe will now be able to cause the nucleus of the crystal 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.430
 we will prepare its grooves by means of a micro manipulator to track down 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.560
 some areas in order to get multiple small pieces of the lens 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.829
 who will be taxing b by the ultrasound probe 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.140
 a single-use injection system will help position the implant 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.189
 in the eye 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.349
 a foldable flexible implant being a player product on itself 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.599
 through incision the implant unfold inside the eve he 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.130
 now is to refocus it in the sexton stay in place a little 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.430
 sponge helps ensure the tightness of the incision 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.629
 sometimes it may be necessary to put a stitch 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.360
 this procedure lasts between 20 and 30 minutes without any difficulty 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.050
 special 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.479
 sometimes it is possible that after two to five years 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.800
 the posterior capsule of the crystalline let in place occurs 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.829
 this secondary cataract is responsible for visual discomfort 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.520
 which justifies a follow-up by some logical regular fortunately when 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.059
 the chain is important the opacification can be treated in 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:53.920
 making an incision in the posterior capsule 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.639
 using a yag laser 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.010
 this treatment is performed in the office of the ophthalmologist 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.330
 it is very simple 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.419
 and without any pain
