00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.120
 1 2 3 cabrio I make Magi a collection of activity books 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.799
 Interactive Multimedia for Learning Mathematics 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.009
 at cm2 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.799
 achieved with the average technology another one that brilliantly has the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.669
 key concepts of the new 2008 program and mathematics for each level 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.929
 school 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.789
 from his mother who are organized by program headings 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 jaked it is accessible in one click 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.110
 this educational research shows that the student learns and retains better what 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.400
 who touched manipulates 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.820
 applying this principle and what is the utility at 2 3 calories offers a 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.309
 real bridge between the real world a thousand students 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.309
 the abstract world of mathematics 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.830
 with another that houses students of manipulates not the intermediate forms 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.960
 a button 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.460
 it takes a shape directly move it 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
 the tour to put it in the right place and in the right orientation 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.540
 the vehicle and its direct was important for the students 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.540
 become aware of the properties themselves I will put forests 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 for this activity the bull prologue figure model 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.410
 he starts strong from a first attempt by building a square and a 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.410
 some independent of each other 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.970
 and when he wants to move this figure to compare it to the models 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 unfortunately he realizes he has two separate elements 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 he's starting again 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.930
 trying this time master religious goods and how both 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 square circle objects 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.010
 she is the province that manipulates poses problems 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.770
 on the affection and continues 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.220
 in the choice of his actions 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 when he observes, however, that he manipulates 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.979
 for which there are other goats the pupil learns not only because 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.089
 that he needs problems 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.679
 and also because the environment reacted and its actions and responses 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.909
 these reactions can pose problems to students favoring 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.349
 learning 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.480
 in this activity the student can not place the comets directly on 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.079
 the ladybug the environment does not allow him 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.169
 he must prepare the name of the necessary stickers in the pink box for 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.169
 then be able to color the dairy ladybug 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.769
 once past the next page it turned out that these six there prepare the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.769
 exact number of stickers to color tasks that the ladybug 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.609
 in the workbooks the reactions on the sky and the answers 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.269
 received on the correct thought or not 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.269
 lf their work in autonomy 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.779
 and which says multipages allow a progression in the activities 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.590
 proposed here to begin he pupil can see at any time the pieces 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.969
 put in the green then recalculate the amount 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.989
 a few pages later he must break his feet in a piggy bank in 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.019
 transparent 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.590
 so we can count mentally and as we go along or prepare 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.669
 coins outside the piggy bank 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.549
 at the end of the notebook he can no longer prepared the crates outside the 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.279
 piggy bank 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.709
 pÃ©ladeau whose mentally calculate mrs morizet you need not measures 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.709
 are a place in the killing 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.489
 the interactivity of which it takes 3 calories allows students to 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.999
 work independently thanks to the reactions of objects 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.149
 but also thanks to the opportunity to check their wives 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.629
 for this activity she has to put the hoods in a queue 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.289
 then answer the question asked in the ads 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.659
 the carousel began to spin only if both sides were just 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.439
 otherwise when one training gives a clue when you are 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.840
 Quebecer who tested in queues 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.569
 a dozen years he knows nothing 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.569
 at the diabolical meeting already installed 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.659
 in any case unique the instructions in writing may also listen 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.060
 Moralization of the instructions facilitates the transmission of the context of the project 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.629
 these activities often from a motivating context that quickly gives the center 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.779
 for mathematics 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:52.870
 his long gametes already have a lot of cars on the parking lot 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.360
 the mechanic must work 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 alas first departure four cars I still have three years 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.120
 he regard only part 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 how many garage cars thierry paris and on tour 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.949
 every Quebecer is an educational promotion with about five to fifteen 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.620
 first tell you about others 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.300
 the collection contains three types of notebooks for different types of 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.020
 needs 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.310
 as soon as he hesitated discovery with activities and covered I have 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.740
 solutions to build 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.210
 these activities can be used to learn to zhouqu new 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.080
 problems 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.150
 exercise books with activities to consolidate 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.490
 knowledge and techniques already introduced 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.410
 and finally the more activity evaluation activities used to evaluate the 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.410
 acquired students 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:49.699
 and what is the assessment providing holiness of yesterday a record of answers 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:50.539
 students 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.539
 it indicates the total number of questions and correct answers as well as the 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.759
 time to answer 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.629
 in this example we can see where are the errors geneva 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.800
 he is able to add numbers but do not master yet 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.559
 totally the value of the numbers on their positions in writing the 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:06.559
 number 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:13.499
 the collection is not developed by its author but by a team of nine 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:15.809
 authors school teacher and meter trainer 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.689
 offering a variety of activities with objectives and modes 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.360
 learning husband 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.919
 it includes a hundred of quebec interactive tivity frames lmp part 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:25.690
 on five cd rom
