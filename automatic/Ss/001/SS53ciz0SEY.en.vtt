00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello and welcome we have 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.400
 a new case by fractal design 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.769
 phones and that define it 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.259
 lets now puzzle the fine it first 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.969
 so maybe this time will be variant 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 No, the has been around there are the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.289
 define mini the define it is like that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 He define a midi-tower meaningful behind it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.750
 that's right for design where the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.619
 It's a whole new interior 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.279
 tried the modern yes downright 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.279
 should be forward-looking 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.870
 is not considered from the outside now 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.780
 of course, why is that define it 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.700
 it almost looks like it ends up 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.850
 like the current he 's fine like that 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.970
 the faina five scandinavian cooled 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.720
 very simple look with clear edged 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.150
 form this then this fake ado front the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.470
 But so is plastic as well 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.660
 has an aluminum structure and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.119
 then just this well-known midi 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.700
 tower format also the cover areal 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.280
 does not really tell us anything new 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.820
 have in the front part controls 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.830
 and connections the two USB 3.0 ports 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.630
 also black colored so that still 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.000
 is a little more discreet and we have 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.310
 behind this known fashion event 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.110
 covers that allow us the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.520
 ventilator places to be closed 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.200
 if we do not need them and too 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.580
 open when we need them 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.390
 typically it is then 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.310
 back wall the innovative housing concepts 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.370
 but reveals even there as the fine 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.320
 it now not spectacular atx 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.140
 power supply below about seven 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.440
 expansion cards slots and finally 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.510
 a backhand fan in 140 millimeters 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.430
 format what is it fine now 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.190
 that's what makes it special 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.950
 clear - in the interior noble to her the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.570
 the screws are turned off 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.230
 By the way, so can not hang 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.230
 get lost 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.810
 and then in principle comes the big one 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.299
 surprise that it is fine in the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.180
 principle a lighter adapted to the 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.849
 He fine-five with completely gutted in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.560
 interior completely gutted it says 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.019
 Actually gives this housing without 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.109
 every running cage so I have nothing 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.700
 tinkered out but that's the one 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.500
 must be factory-shipped 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.719
 of course still give are 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.879
 all behind the trail 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.359
 hiked and thus we have here 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.189
 completely open mainboard segment with the 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.389
 possibility also the components very much 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.730
 to cool directly 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.829
 she just does not think she's up 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.590
 the cooling would now stand in the way 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.359
 factory 2 140 millimeter fan 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.049
 preinstalled have the back wall fan 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.939
 we already saw 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.109
 the second air is here behind the 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:12.359
 front there is a sucking air and yes 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.669
 directly synonymous on the level of the graphics card 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.799
 and heatsink I was supposed to so 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.780
 a pretty direct cooling effect 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.900
 then of course you can develop 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.659
 more fans places in the front area in the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.979
 lid portion and in the bottom region in 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.560
 the variant with closed 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:31.889
 side part also still in the side part 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.510
 Of course, then beyond that 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.180
 the possibility of also radiators too 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.979
 use if we are here under the lid 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.379
 we have to see, though 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.079
 okay the lid radiator has it then 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.049
 but a bit tight but we have here 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.049
 thanks to the vanished drive cages 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.109
 Ample space for front radiators 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.449
 can there be a 360 with it 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.609
 considerable thickness accommodate that 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.879
 Last but not least then most likely 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.069
 the graphics card length limits this 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.419
 define it is one of the housing where 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.579
 the look behind the mainboard tray 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.620
 at least as exciting as that 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.449
 looking at the mainboard segment into 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.639
 it's just because we do not 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.159
 only the cable management have completely 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.880
 practically with Velcro again 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:21.120
 solved and rubberized with these 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.820
 boys but we all have too 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.860
 drive places behind prey and that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
 are not just these two known 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.419
 two and a half dollar hard places that gives 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.760
 yes, at the bottom of a five in the same 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.490
 form but 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.350
 In addition, there are three 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.410
 combined two and a half and three and a half inches 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.340
 drive places for ssds and hard drives 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.690
 3 inch drives are decoupled 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.550
 screwed two and a half counters 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.050
 at the smaller holes and 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.660
 decoupled and the whole will then 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.360
 again like the rhine two and a half 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.300
 inch drive carriers with one 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.030
 screw fixed when fully loaded 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.370
 would do the whole thing with the cable then 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.540
 Surely something confused would be there you have to 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.410
 then very around cable management 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.740
 endeavor 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.930
 but we have in the 3 inch level here 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.830
 then a little more space because of the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.840
 coach yes back and we will 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.940
 have a principle in the first place completely 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.890
 convince the cable management where you 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.440
 then with a little effort all the same 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.570
 should be accommodated by that 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.120
 banish the drives behind then just 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.860
 this gigantic looking empty 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.890
 interior though it's really easy 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.450
 only a normal midi tower is any 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.880
 Quantity space can be endlessly long 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.370
 accommodate video cards and we have 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.080
 that also mentioned the possibility 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.570
 a compensating tank here at the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.080
 rear wall to mount and we have here 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.020
 below 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.660
 these four holes and in principle 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.040
 also a water cooling pump 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.430
 to be able to attach 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.240
 that define it that surprised and it 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.090
 polarized, too, certainly was here 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.400
 simply have a housing that the user 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.600
 opened a little less possibilities than 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.820
 sd 4 5 but it is taken for itself 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.230
 consistently and you actually 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.840
 future-oriented external drive 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.830
 just completely painted the same way 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.150
 like the drive cages and for one 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.810
 mainboard segment what i essential 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.850
 can use more versatile what also 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.710
 simply modern is that the 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.460
 cooling does not affect somehow 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.260
 will be the biggest criticism maybe for 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.050
 the users are now with the the 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.030
 Drive situation is the 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.850
 Missing fan control which became here 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.870
 namely with the front door with 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.940
 crossed out 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.120
 but then as a compensation 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.280
 reduce sale price entry price 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.200
 for the fine food 90 euro and so 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.350
 it is actually even cheaper 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.510
 as the define he 5 we have that 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.360
 the fans already made for a test 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:05.540
 parallel to the video this test appears 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.540
 then on our page on vox.de
