00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
hounds

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.300 
hounds
initially<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.530> think<00:01:53.710> there<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:53.980> a<00:01:54.070> little

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
initially I think there is a little

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.610 
initially I think there is a little
twinge<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:54.970> when<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.659> overall<00:01:56.080> spray<00:01:56.409> out

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
twinge there when the overall spray out

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.100 
twinge there when the overall spray out
is<00:01:56.920> actually<00:01:57.430> cost<00:01:57.790> saving<00:01:58.060> well<00:01:58.390> here<00:01:58.990> again

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
is actually cost saving well here again

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.800 
is actually cost saving well here again
we<00:01:59.530> say<00:01:59.890> with<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.400> toners<00:02:01.000> or<00:02:01.270> or<00:02:01.690> urethane

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
we say with the toners or or urethane

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.420 
we say with the toners or or urethane
they're<00:02:03.110> not<00:02:03.259> freezer<00:02:03.590> pump<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.159> they<00:02:04.369> are

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
they're not freezer pump and they are

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
they're not freezer pump and they are
concentrated<00:02:05.090> three<00:02:05.240> times<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:06.140> reality

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
concentrated three times so in reality

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.859 
concentrated three times so in reality
you're<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> thing<00:02:08.330> sovereign<00:02:09.330> product<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you're a thing sovereign product if you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.509 
you're a thing sovereign product if you
want<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> call<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.370> their

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
want to call it that because in their

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.830 
want to call it that because in their
natural<00:02:11.670> state<00:02:11.940> they<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.569> mixed<00:02:12.720> with

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
natural state they can be mixed with

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.080 
natural state they can be mixed with
solid<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.010> use<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.430> our<00:02:14.519> undercoats

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
solid so we can use it in our undercoats

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.150 
solid so we can use it in our undercoats
and<00:02:15.300> our<00:02:15.360> tintable<00:02:15.690> sealers<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.620> bring<00:02:16.830> colors

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and our tintable sealers to bring colors

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.380 
and our tintable sealers to bring colors
and<00:02:17.400> primers<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.819> closer

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
and primers in closer

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.440 
and primers in closer
also<00:02:20.170> when<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.620> reduce<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.310> taken<00:02:21.940> temporarily

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
also when we reduce it taken temporarily

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.380 
also when we reduce it taken temporarily
into<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> war<00:02:23.470> based<00:02:23.920> stage<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:25.150> have<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
into a war based stage we have the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.500 
into a war based stage we have the
capability<00:02:26.140> of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
capability of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.270 
capability of
using<00:02:26.870> half<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.409> toners

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
using half of the toners

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.100 
using half of the toners
so<00:02:28.670> make<00:02:28.850> what<00:02:29.240> we're<00:02:29.450> looking<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.990> other

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
so make what we're looking for in other

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.960 
so make what we're looking for in other
words<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.650> I'm<00:02:30.830> making<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.310> pint<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.730> color

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
words if I'm making a pint of color

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.840 
words if I'm making a pint of color
heaven<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.080> pipe<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.830> only<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.430> towards<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
heaven that pipe is only the towards the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.880 
heaven that pipe is only the towards the
other<00:02:35.000> half<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.480> bouncers<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.350> reduces

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
other half of the bouncers and reduces

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.010 
other half of the bouncers and reduces
to<00:02:37.010> get<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.280> into<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.520> one<00:02:37.819> state<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.780> lets

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
to get it into that one state it's lets

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.990 
to get it into that one state it's lets
stretching<00:02:39.470> my<00:02:39.560> toners<00:02:40.069> I'm<00:02:40.280> not<00:02:40.459> ordering<00:02:40.880> as

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
stretching my toners I'm not ordering as

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.309 
stretching my toners I'm not ordering as
frequently<00:02:41.540> as<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.930> might<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.170> thinking

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
frequently as you might be thinking

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.170 
frequently as you might be thinking
absolutely<00:02:43.160> we've<00:02:43.310> done<00:02:43.490> conversions<00:02:44.030> where

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
absolutely we've done conversions where

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.910 
absolutely we've done conversions where
people<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:44.959> have<00:02:45.170> installed<00:02:45.680> and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
people actually have installed and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.130 
people actually have installed and
saying<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.550> lasting<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.390> lot<00:02:47.510> longer<00:02:47.569> and

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
saying this is lasting a lot longer and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.010 
saying this is lasting a lot longer and
I<00:02:48.380> thought

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
I thought

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.750 
I thought
because<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.350> conversion<00:02:49.830> comes<00:02:50.010> over<00:02:50.340> in

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
because the conversion comes over in

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.490 
because the conversion comes over in
half<00:02:51.030> liters<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.600> liters<00:02:51.660> everybody's

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
half liters and liters everybody's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.880 
half liters and liters everybody's
getting<00:02:52.620> away<00:02:52.920> from<00:02:52.980> gallons

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
getting away from gallons

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.350 
getting away from gallons
and<00:02:54.190> they<00:02:54.280> think<00:02:54.430> oh<00:02:54.580> my<00:02:54.760> god<00:02:54.970> I'm<00:02:55.120> going<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.270> be

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
and they think oh my god I'm going to be

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.540 
and they think oh my god I'm going to be
replacing<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> walk<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:57.190> keep<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.490> mind

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
replacing so the walk but keep in mind

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.240 
replacing so the walk but keep in mind
they<00:02:57.850> are<00:02:58.209> concentrated<00:02:59.080> up

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
they are concentrated up

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.830 
they are concentrated up
the<00:03:00.370> risk<00:03:00.850> when<00:03:01.360> they<00:03:01.480> come<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.780> they

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
the risk when they come out they

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.380 
the risk when they come out they
actually<00:03:02.260> come<00:03:02.410> out<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.210> wrote
