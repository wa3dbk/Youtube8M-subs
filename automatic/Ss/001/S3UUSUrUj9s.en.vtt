00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.290 
this map what I really like about this
map<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.080> how<00:02:29.069> much<00:02:29.190> faster<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.880> move<00:02:29.940> and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
map is how much faster you move and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.900 
map is how much faster you move and
faster<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> run<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.980> part<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
faster you run and part of that is the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.840 
faster you run and part of that is the
space<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.430> feels<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.239> little<00:02:36.830> more

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
space but it just feels a little more

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.490 
space but it just feels a little more
natural<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:41.300> when<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.420> were<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.870> slowly<00:02:43.230> as

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
natural and when you were so slowly as

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.080 
natural and when you were so slowly as
you<00:02:43.530> doing<00:02:43.830> sometimes<00:02:44.340> any<00:02:44.520> place<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.940> your

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you doing sometimes any place on your

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.090 
you doing sometimes any place on your
man<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.390> feels<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.050> um<00:02:48.170> overly<00:02:49.170> inhibiting

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
man it feels really um overly inhibiting

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.080 
man it feels really um overly inhibiting
it<00:02:50.970> doesn't<00:02:51.780> feel<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.580> way<00:02:53.880> that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
it doesn't feel at all like a way that

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
it doesn't feel at all like a way that
someone<00:02:54.540> would<00:02:54.810> really<00:02:55.260> move<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:57.830> realize<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
someone would really move I realize I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.100 
someone would really move I realize I
wasn't<00:02:59.850> getting<00:03:00.000> close<00:03:00.360> enough<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.780> pick<00:03:00.930> that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
wasn't getting close enough to pick that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.980 
wasn't getting close enough to pick that
up

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
up

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.059 
up
boy<00:03:04.780> yeah<00:03:06.910> I'm<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.240> getting

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
boy yeah I'm not getting

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.300 
boy yeah I'm not getting
as<00:03:10.159> much<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.569> kind<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.409> atmospheric

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
as much of the kind of atmospheric

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.720 
as much of the kind of atmospheric
tension<00:03:13.909> in<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.810> slender<00:03:15.139> game<00:03:15.469> as<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:16.400> was<00:03:16.760> in

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.680 

elementary<00:03:20.730> or<00:03:21.500> mansion<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:24.030> think<00:03:24.840> those<00:03:25.080> two

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
elementary or mansion I think those two

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.790 
elementary or mansion I think those two
permeated<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.720> best<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.170> kind<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.440> building

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
permeated the best of kind of building

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.800 
permeated the best of kind of building
an<00:03:28.890> atmosphere<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:31.310> sense<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.600> tension<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
an atmosphere and a sense of tension and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.240 
an atmosphere and a sense of tension and
apprehension

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:54.460 

he'll<00:03:41.790> face

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.420 

so

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:14.440 

I<00:04:09.640> really<00:04:10.640> like<00:04:10.849> go<00:04:11.120> home<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.760> textures<00:04:14.269> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
I really like go home the textures and

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.909 
I really like go home the textures and
how<00:04:14.540> many<00:04:14.719> detail<00:04:15.230> went<00:04:15.530> into<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:15.890> map<00:04:17.919> it's

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
how many detail went into this map it's

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.950 
how many detail went into this map it's
impressive<00:04:19.959> i'm<00:04:20.959> looking<00:04:21.169> forward<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:22.960> these

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
impressive i'm looking forward to these

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.189 
impressive i'm looking forward to these
guys<00:04:24.229> have<00:04:24.590> talked<00:04:25.009> about<00:04:25.190> releasing<00:04:25.729> an<00:04:26.240> sdk

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
guys have talked about releasing an sdk

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.200 
guys have talked about releasing an sdk
but<00:04:27.620> for<00:04:28.360> slender<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:31.550> various<00:04:32.120> people

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
but for slender so that various people

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.390 
but for slender so that various people
can<00:04:32.630> just<00:04:32.780> create<00:04:33.020> their<00:04:33.259> own<00:04:33.289> 12<00:04:33.860> laps<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:36.400> by

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
can just create their own 12 laps and by

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.339 
can just create their own 12 laps and by
using<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:37.910> same<00:04:38.090> thing<00:04:38.300> they<00:04:38.419> use<00:04:38.599> and<00:04:39.050> i'm

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
using the same thing they use and i'm

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.969 
using the same thing they use and i'm
guessing<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.770> they<00:04:39.889> do<00:04:39.949> release<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:41.979> i'm

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
guessing if they do release that i'm

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.650 
guessing if they do release that i'm
guessing<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:43.789> did<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.090> really<00:04:44.270> said<00:04:44.509> there

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
guessing if did you really said there

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:53.179 
guessing if did you really said there
will<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.139> ton<00:04:45.199> of<00:04:46.240> slender<00:04:47.240> maps<00:04:48.160> coming<00:04:49.160> out

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.050 

which<00:04:54.189> could<00:04:54.370> be<00:04:54.460> really<00:04:54.610> cool<00:04:54.879> um<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:57.060> that's

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
which could be really cool um and that's

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.850 
which could be really cool um and that's
going<00:04:58.569> to<00:04:58.659> me<00:04:58.810> Nicole<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.259> only<00:04:59.500> in<00:04:59.620> there<00:04:59.740> will

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
going to me Nicole is only in there will

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.860 
going to me Nicole is only in there will
be<00:05:00.009> some<00:05:00.310> some<00:05:00.729> really<00:05:00.970> cool<00:05:01.180> ones<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.509> also

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
be some some really cool ones that also

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:13.980 
be some some really cool ones that also
mean<00:05:02.050> there'll<00:05:02.289> be<00:05:02.319> some<00:05:02.969> really<00:05:12.960> he'll<00:05:13.960> also

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
mean there'll be some really he'll also

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.589 
mean there'll be some really he'll also
probably<00:05:14.590> be<00:05:14.710> some<00:05:14.889> really<00:05:15.669> bad<00:05:15.879> news<00:05:15.909> to<00:05:16.449> be

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
probably be some really bad news to be

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.459 
probably be some really bad news to be
honest<00:05:17.020> then<00:05:17.319> you<00:05:17.710> might<00:05:18.129> have<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.460> sit<00:05:18.729> there

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
honest then you might have to sit there

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.420 
honest then you might have to sit there
find<00:05:20.469> the<00:05:20.680> jump<00:05:21.069> I<00:05:22.439> think<00:05:23.439> it<00:05:23.560> couldn't<00:05:24.069> really

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
find the jump I think it couldn't really

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:33.060 
find the jump I think it couldn't really
cool

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.320 

that<00:05:34.070> was<00:05:34.160> pretty<00:05:34.340> good<00:05:34.430> seven<00:05:35.030> out<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.150> eight

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
that was pretty good seven out of eight

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.620 
that was pretty good seven out of eight
stages<00:05:37.210> it's<00:05:39.100> so<00:05:40.100> that's<00:05:40.310> seventh<00:05:40.880> Street<00:05:41.210> it

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
stages it's so that's seventh Street it

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.290 
stages it's so that's seventh Street it
feels<00:05:42.140> a<00:05:42.470> little<00:05:42.860> more<00:05:43.190> laid<00:05:43.550> back<00:05:43.580> than<00:05:43.910> the

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
feels a little more laid back than the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:52.720 
feels a little more laid back than the
last<00:05:44.570> few<00:05:44.960> maps<00:05:45.230> um<00:05:45.730> less<00:05:46.730> tense<00:05:48.190> and<00:05:51.580> there<00:05:52.580> is

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
last few maps um less tense and there is

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.190 
last few maps um less tense and there is
not<00:05:52.940> as<00:05:53.180> much<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.930> sense<00:05:54.110> of<00:05:54.290> dread<00:05:54.620> but<00:05:58.000> it's

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
not as much of a sense of dread but it's

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.310 
not as much of a sense of dread but it's
it's<00:06:00.200> fun<00:06:00.560> in<00:06:00.740> its<00:06:00.890> own<00:06:01.040> way
