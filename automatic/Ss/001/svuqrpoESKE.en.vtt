00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 I will explain how to reset the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.269
 etap of the bios and leave it as 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 it comes from the factory that we have to do 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.929
 look first of all it's always 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.760
 recommended that you wear gloves 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.560
 latex gloves as we have always 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 said here at this moment we are 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 seeing the two and rites where we would have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.220
 what to put this jumper we would place it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220
 this way 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.410
 we have already placed the jumper and now 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.650
 you wonder what we should do 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.739
 we would have to wait 6 seconds for 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.880
 reset the bios setup with six 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.040
 seconds is enough 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.890
 there would be what we would have to do 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.739
 we will remove the jumper there we would have it and 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.470
 ready if you realize here we are 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.040
 seeing the pile is responsible for 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.920
 keep the date the time the month the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.520
 parameters of the bio which is what 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.010
 we would do with a screwdriver we would do 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.240
 this 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.240
 we would take the stack 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.240
 and it would take six seconds and with 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 only six seconds we would return it to 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.170
 place the battery in its place remember 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.740
 that has a position we would return it to 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.740
 place in your site 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 there would be the stack placed setup of the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.430
 bios would be reset with only 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.330
 six seconds if the jumper does not 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.690
 it worked 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.260
 we tried 6 seconds the battery see that this 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.050
 plate model the bios has three 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.479
 You see, you would have to put the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.970
 jumper in this way if you see that of 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.050
 this way does not work we would put it 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.170
 well and ready it proves six seconds 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 only 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 remember six seconds reset the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 setup of the bios with six seconds or 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.149
 well we took out the battery we would take the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.149
 pile here we are watching 6 seconds 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.819
 We wait 6 seconds and we will return 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.819
 place the stack 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.750
 there would be the newly placed pillar 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.990
 what has happened to a lot of people 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.810
 since the bios does not reset a good 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.640
 idea to take the stack out of the plate or put 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.390
 the jumper and once the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.910
 jumper wait at least 20 minutes at a 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.640
 hour that is let's go by steps we do 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.460
 those of the jumper six seconds we do the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.000
 of the battery six seconds and it does not work 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.700
 we would have to do third option 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.970
 we would wait 20 minutes to an hour and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.340
 we put back either the stack or the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.010
 jumper on the site that was 20 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.220
 minutes to an hour and we put it back 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.080
 and many people say everything done and the plate 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.290
 it starts beeping 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.710
 first connect the pc to the current 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.690
 without the battery we take out the battery is worth 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.620
 have the battery put on the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.260
 team we press f1 to enter the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.350
 bios setup press 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.190
 efe 2 to reset by default all the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.180
 avÃ­o without having the pile 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.580
 and that the bios stay by default 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.150
 we let the system open turn off the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.490
 pc you replace the battery you turn on 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.790
 the pc but before what we have to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.550
 to do is go to efe 8 once 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.220
 we are already in the ship setup there what 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.170
 what we have to do is place it now 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.350
 we let the system know how to restart the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.170
 PC or pay it and I do not think I'll get back 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.240
 to give the problem of the beeps in this 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.000
 way you will be able to solve the 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.010
 problem of the beeps if you follow 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 these steps you will be able to reset the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.170
 setup of the bios you will be able to put the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.000
 time the date correctly thank you for 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.370

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.250
