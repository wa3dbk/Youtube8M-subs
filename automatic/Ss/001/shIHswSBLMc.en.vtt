00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:13.370
 we are in tortoreto near a 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.060
 subway presenting 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.520
 us the consequences of the night of 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.650
 rain that has returned to fall in 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.380
 val vibrata especially on 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.779
 costa has already recreated the damage it is 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.220
 practically they are usual when 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.210
 these things happen 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.790
 so spring showed his 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.200
 first empty pass and is back 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.780
 really to bring down a rain 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.260
 incessant that for all the night has 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.239
 practically flooded many of these 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.629
 underpasses like the one you see behind 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.550
 of us the water and got up a lot 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.370
 underpass was closed even if in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 this time the water level 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.829
 itself has gone down and some cars 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.030
 try however to cross the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.510
 underpass and others in this area e 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.250
 here in tortoreto they tell us the same 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.770
 situation more or less in some 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.050
 in some streets but also of dawn 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.790
 adriatic and martinsicuro therefore e 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.550
 to the invitation we give you and that 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.530
 obviously to prudence 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.530
 then on this bad weather day there 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.840
 we moved to via Ascolana on 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.250
 territory of Adriatic dawn in the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.200
 near the kennel 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.450
 and right on that famous bridge that it is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.000
 It reopened recently is to 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.700
 our backs we also saw that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.400
 that today the bad weather is causing 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.180
 ie an erosion situation again 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.729
 of the banks 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.890
 we met on this right on 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.040
 this bridge over this area 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.630
 luca bonfire minority adviser of 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.340
 common of Adriatic dawn to which 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.800
 just ask for a comment on this 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 that on this situation, in short, that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.710
 we are watching our teams 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.390
 look at the comment is the only one possible 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.910
 that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.100
 and that these tab Adriatic in the province 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.220
 of Asian teramo these situations yes 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.870
 they are dragging without it being possible 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.340
 hope someone will help you 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.840
 I remember very well that in the last one 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.310
 meeting which was held in the hall 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.920
 there were many citizens at conferences 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.130
 the data trees that can thus a question 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.630
 civil engineering engineer is just that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.070
 it was about that shore that 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.780
 now it's back because you could tell 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.280
 very well that the flood of months 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.890
 past he had created problems not only 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.200
 to the bridge but in general to the side bank 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 alba me would have been a duty of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.950
 an administration to urge that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.690
 that was who those interventions were 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.070
 minimum for the protection of an asset 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.120
 municipal 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.110
 sincerely 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.510
 let's hope this rain stops 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.900
 my question was also one 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.549
 response that left margins of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.650
 hope in the sense that engineers and said 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.379
 we are thinking about it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.599
 three hundred meters to the right and to the right 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.640
 vibrata to protect it not with gods 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.110
 champions because we have no money but 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.330
 at least with some re-profiling land 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.129
 the embankment so that the river does not fat 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.819
 these problems we see today 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.310
 for a rain of a few hours 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.500
 practically the bank the one near the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 kennel 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.930
 collapsed again ie there is a piece 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.270
 just further collapsed you see 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.220
 that you try back then shortly vi 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.710
 we will show the images well with gods 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.270
 close-ups and there at this point yes 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.640
 they really create problems also for 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.160
 those concerns the kennel itself I think 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.450
 that in those conditions it is not accessible 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.680
 the kennel or at least the part aside 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.960
 towards the river is absolutely not 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.450
 usable nor can one think that a 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.100
 in the middle of the night the volunteers or whoever 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.880
 occupies the canile then has the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.460
 constancy the ability to move a 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.490
 large number of animals is another 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.100
 bad story in which in my opinion yes 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.200
 sum the natural causes to 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.930
 responsibility instead of politics in 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.440
 this our year tour for 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.090
 document the hardships of bad weather 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.910
 this night which is continuing also 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.260
 right now is procuring to 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.240
 road conditions 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.880
 we are at the moment from the materials 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.660
 that we came across this one 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.270
 underpass near the state 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.970
 Adriatic we are as I told you at dawn 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.620
 Adriatic in the so-called underpass 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.960
 that of the gattopardo the underpass of the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.610
 Leopard that is not currently closed 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.090
 but which presents a situation of 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.550
 really obvious problem with some 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.680
 machines that come back and others 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.770
 instead they venture to ourselves 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.420
 in short, we tried to cross it 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.280
 we certainly found it huge 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.110
 in short, difficulties risking ourselves 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.750
 to get bogged down below 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.700
 the latest traffic update 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.940
 which is obviously finding some 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.160
 difficulties today due to bad weather 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.720
 we always do in the dawn area 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.760
 Adriatic on a road that does not present 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.430
 underpasses but that was the same 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.340
 closed we talk about via gorizia in 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.930
 near the carabinieri barracks 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.850
 this line was absolutely 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.260
 closed because as you see mine 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.870
 shoulders is absolutely no one 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.380
 depression and which has been filled with 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.660
 water for all the practicability of the 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.360
 road that therefore is currently 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.220
 closed this morning tour on the sui 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 in short, difficulties linked to bad weather 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.200
 on the viability of tortoreto and dawn 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.540
 Adriatic for this morning 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.900
 we close here for 1 luigi internet tv
