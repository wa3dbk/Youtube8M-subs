00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.520
 i 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.920
 hello everyone here reason 'welcome to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.660
 channel and welcome to a new video on 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.870
 this case something that already had enough 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.820
 time thinking about doing and that if it gives us 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.590
 one has nothing to do with what 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.420
 another lately to the channel this is not going to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.609
 be bless play or anything like it 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.960
 a little video reflection of those that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.730
 I like to do from time to time and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.529
 that quite some time since you no 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 I bring and that on this occasion you have to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.949
 see with the video game that you have in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.169
 screen with metal gear solid 5 ground 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.910
 zero is a title that has given has had 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.670
 much controversy so to speak but 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.380
 before focusing on the video game as 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 so or rather in the subject I wanted 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 especially thank the guys for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.530
 javi my well-known videogame store 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 online that thanks to them is why 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 I was able to enjoy this video game like this 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
 what less do they do to small 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.810
 references to them and of course if you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.640
 I want to buy video games because those 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.040
 fairly cheap internet and other os 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
 I will leave the link of your website in the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.490
 description for you to throw a 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.640
 look and 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.079
 I have said all that as I say 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.549
 let's focus on what's important in the 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.200
 videogame what you give right now 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.310
 will then be about five or ten minutes not 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.750
 I know how long this video will last but 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.680
 well the first five or ten minutes 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 of the video game 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.270
 just spoilers have actually recorded 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.310
 about an hour or so of the game 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 but mainly it's like this part 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 so there are no poses or spoilers 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.890
 this surely you will have seen 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.020
 in a myriad of sites like who says 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.479
 so it's nothing that you can not wait 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.760
 the important thing of this video is the theme 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.650
 I wanted to comment not the relationship 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.660
 quality-price with the theme of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.470
 sure duration that many have heard 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.000
 a lot of news talking about what 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.160
 short that was this video game that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.690
 it really is a video game but in 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.490
 principle is a kind of prologue if 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.500
 you are not jumping a little bit about how it's going 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 to send goal it is assumed that metal gear 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 solid 5 ground cyrus is a prologue to what 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.800
 that is being metal gear solid 5 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.500
 phantom paint that yes that is the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.149
 own video game that belongs to the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 metal franchise is also by 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.440
 course but simply a small 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.780
 prolog by the way about metal and just 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 five phantom sorry there's no date yet 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.570
 launch but it is expected for late 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.470
 of this year or early next 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.780
 It's worth it if you're interested but good 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.270
 so now we go into a bit 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.460
 complicated terrain under my point 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.910
 seen then how much a 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.220
 prologue can prologue what good what 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.070
 you can pass this video game in just 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.740
 two hours 34 hours you can spend 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.940
 doing even secondaries that pussy 4 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.490
 hours 23 hours can you pass 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.380
 doing secondary included fact 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.970
 in fact a little bit ago it came to light or 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.580
 he became famous an uncle who had 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.040
 past this video game in just 10 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 minutes 10 minutes yes it is true that 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.080
 obviously he was going without stopping any 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.700
 moment was a kind of speed ram 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.320
 because of the typical ones that usually do what 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.880
 faster as possible without making secondary 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.140
 focusing only on the objective 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.910
 main and that 's it but it's still 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.430
 that comes a little attention not until 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.350
 what point is worth a video game 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.930
 that you can not spend in 10 minutes 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.010
 obviously obviously there is much more 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.120
 content in the title there 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.080
 collectibles in fact the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.880
 collectibles that can carry a 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.740
 little time to find them all 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.930
 but they are still collectible 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.209
 secondary objectives and who scored the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.070
 world you are convinced then the title has 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.780
 gone out for playstation 3 playstation 4 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.550
 in fact what you have on the screen is him 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.590
 and playstation3 gameplay has also 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.940
 gone for 360 and for xbox one for 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.410
 computer has not left sadly but 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.990
 with me has left for those platforms 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.410
 for a price of 25 euros what comes 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.450
 being something like two of lg talking a 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.890
 little of the price at which we are 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.350
 accustomed in the industry of 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.790
 video games normally those of leces or 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.310
 the last of milks that have come out 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.650
 the sale tend to have a price 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.930
 Approximate between 12 15 euros 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.090
 some 10 soles a little cheaper 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.120
 but yes between 10 and 15 let's put that 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 about 12 and it's worth little if we do the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.250
 sums are comfortable dlcs then up 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.330
 what point would you be willing to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.610
 spend the 25 euros on a video game that 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.650
 well it's worth it that you can spend it in 10 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.480
 minutes but approximately doing 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.760
 everything just like it can cost 23 hours 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.650
 approximately is something pretty 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.900
 complicated the videogame industry 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.540
 they have not had many references either 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.220
 on the subject in this topic there has not been 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.650
 Occasional prologue casually 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.560
 also from Nipponese lands as is the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.840
 case of great tourism 5 weeks I remember 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.270
 if 4 or 5 right now I'm not 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.850
 sure but already in his day we saw a 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.650
 small 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.660
 for tourism 5 that was supposed to be good 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.490
 and will offer much of what 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.040
 offered the video game and in the end it was not 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.660
 not much less that but anyway now 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.070
 there are people that of course you 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.080
 I'm not saying enjoys no 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.730
 it's worth buying the day 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.950
 are 5 degrees and not much less 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.050
 but it is true that it makes you think 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.410
 a little bit not to what extent it's profitable 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.840
 or to what extent do we value the fact of 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.820
 the quality of the price especially and the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.010
 duration there are video games like 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.720
 example minecraft I know that is the typical 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.720
 topicazo not that is usually removed in this 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.100
 type of topics but yes it is true that 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.630
 while for example how much it costs 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.700
 currently I do not know if it costs fifteen or 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.620
 twenty euros and it's really worth not 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.360
 they have an obvious a priori objective 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.040
 the goal is to take down a boss 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.980
 resident finish you discover the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.500
 worlds with caesar vouchers but really the 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.449
 freedom that video game offers 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.249
 incites 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.139
 to a longer duration than what it does 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.789
 really degrees and the grausinos you 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.949
 you pass the main objective you spend the 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.309
 secondary objective that replayability 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.339
 it has that value it can be that same 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.449
 like infiltration and want 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.270
 focus it differently every time 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.729
 you put them but without a doubt I think 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.949
 that is not the right thing to take out 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.449
 videogames or this kind of mini 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.389
 video game I would call it rather mini 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.639
 videogames that is not that they have bad 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.219
 quality, much less how little I have 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.349
 played to metal gear solid 5th I am 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:54.339
 enjoying a lot graphically to 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.379
 Although in this version of 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.249
 playstation 3 does not seem very amazing 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.930
 but yes it is true that it is very 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.669
 correct or is it well done in crisis 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.819
 or 3 there is a tiny popping failure 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.620
 but apart from that there is nothing remarkable 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.249
 but it is true that it looks very good 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.259
 on the big consoles too 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.669
 has a good gameplay is going to 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.679
 like if you're a fan of the saga you're going to 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.839
 Like, of course, but I do not stop 

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.399
 ask me that if really the 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.729
 video game industry 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:22.559
 it's not the right thing to do 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:26.459
 video games so short with so little 

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:29.159
 replayability for a price not to mention 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:31.979
 so high but yes for that price not 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.569
 It would have been better to be a little bit 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.949
 take out this video game is not to tell us 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.169
 will sell half a day only 5 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.689
 degrees go and put it within one's own 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.949
 goal the day 65 phantom paint I think that 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.659
 if it had been the most correct but 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.429
 obviously the industry or at least the 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.929
 company that sells the game does not 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:49.709
 I would have derived so many benefits from that 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:52.469
 way by any means I do not know in the end was 

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:53.969
 a little reflection that I wanted to make 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.499
 I do not pretend to get anywhere 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:57.119
 you just know that I like it 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.679
 those who have the most time 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:59.819
 following my channel you know that I 

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.549
 like to do these from time to time 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.659
 videos take out a topic and talk a little 

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:05.809
 about that and above all know your 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:07.649
 opinion what do you think about this really 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:09.149
 harms this to the industry of 

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:11.669
 video games that have video games so 

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:14.280
 short and with such a short duration per 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:17.550
 a price we say is not adequate 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.170
 offers I do not know what I said I do not pretend 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.240
 come to no conclusion I do not intend 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.340
 get to any absolute truth in plan 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.260
 it is not names worth this title nor 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.030
 much less because if you're a metal fan 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.560
 day sun and 5 of course it's good to 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.710
 mentality in general of course that 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.270
 It's worth it on Thursdays and a little 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.889
 more than simply saying about tim in 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.320
 the comments what do you think are 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.120
 the opposites will tell us really 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.180
 you think it's worth buying what 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.190
 I hope your opinion and nothing else 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.110
 it's just a little video we 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.090
 I have not done this for quite some time 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.700
 kind of things and we missed it 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.020
 I missed and yet with all the 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.400
 controversy that had around metal gear 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.350
 Of course I entered our 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.820
 tits and that nothing I hope that what 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.740
 Enjoy the video you enjoyed 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.820
 of course give me your opinion and 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.440
 as I said before at the beginning 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.660
 thanks above all to the guys from javi 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.460
 for giving me the opportunity to play 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.140
 metal gear solid 5 graus and so nothing 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.090
 more than part thanks for having seen 

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.740
 Do not hesitate to leave your opinion in the 

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.740
 comments be happy and see you
