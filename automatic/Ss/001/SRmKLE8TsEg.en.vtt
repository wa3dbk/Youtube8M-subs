00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
concealed a problem in the moment this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
concealed a problem in the moment this
actually<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> treatment<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.860> help<00:00:55.980> you

that way you won't have that problem I

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
that way you won't have that problem I
am<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.559> thinking<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.280> doing<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
am actually thinking of doing like a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.750 
am actually thinking of doing like a
before<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.809> after<00:01:03.989> thing<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.339> husband

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
before and after thing with my husband

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.609 
before and after thing with my husband
he<00:01:05.939> has<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.360> large<00:01:06.600> pores<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:07.380> hoping

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
he has really large pores and I'm hoping

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.390 
he has really large pores and I'm hoping
that<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:08.250> work<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.880> him<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
that this will actually work for him and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.830 
that this will actually work for him and
most<00:01:11.400> drink<00:01:11.670> his<00:01:11.820> pores<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> has<00:01:12.570> mine

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
most drink his pores like it has mine

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
most drink his pores like it has mine
and<00:01:13.170> probably<00:01:13.950> you'll<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.369> able<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and probably you'll be able to see the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
and probably you'll be able to see the
difference<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> lot<00:01:15.450> better<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:15.900> him<00:01:16.080> because

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
difference a lot better with him because

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.890 
difference a lot better with him because
of<00:01:16.470> his<00:01:16.710> large<00:01:17.100> pores<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.119> hopefully<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> will
