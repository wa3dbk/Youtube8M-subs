00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600 

I<00:00:00.210> just<00:00:00.719> love<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.350> idea<00:00:01.650> of<00:00:01.740> developing<00:00:02.220> an

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
I just love the idea of developing an

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.660 
I just love the idea of developing an
evolution<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.529> over<00:00:04.529> crystal<00:00:05.250> like<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:05.609> it

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
evolution of a over crystal like how it

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.430 
evolution of a over crystal like how it
from<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.879> stone<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.750> can<00:00:06.870> go<00:00:06.960> into<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.170> crystal

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
from a stone you can go into a crystal

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.860 
from a stone you can go into a crystal
and<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.790> kind<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.360> as<00:00:09.570> as

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
and how you can have that kind of as as

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.950 
and how you can have that kind of as as
an<00:00:10.139> accessory<00:00:10.849> suspending<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.969> clothes<00:00:12.240> just

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
an accessory suspending the clothes just

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.450 
an accessory suspending the clothes just
really<00:00:13.349> like<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> thought<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.219> fitted

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
really like that I thought really fitted

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.860 
really like that I thought really fitted
in<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.700> what<00:00:14.849> we're<00:00:15.030> doing<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.540> thought<00:00:15.809> it

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
in with what we're doing I thought it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.710 
in with what we're doing I thought it
was<00:00:15.990> beautiful<00:00:16.550> Hussain<00:00:17.550> always<00:00:18.060> has<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> real

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
was beautiful Hussain always has a real

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.330 
was beautiful Hussain always has a real
concept<00:00:19.260> behind<00:00:19.470> everything<00:00:19.859> he<00:00:20.130> does<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
concept behind everything he does and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.390 
concept behind everything he does and
this<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.850> all<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.090> evolution<00:00:22.400> obviously

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
this was all about evolution obviously

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.009 
this was all about evolution obviously
the<00:00:23.519> crystals<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.060> integral<00:00:24.510> part<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.810> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the crystals are integral part of that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.410 
the crystals are integral part of that
and<00:00:25.439> moving<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> panels<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and moving from the panels down the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.060 
and moving from the panels down the
middle<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> dresses<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> necklines

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
middle of the dresses to the necklines

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
middle of the dresses to the necklines
and<00:00:29.599> then<00:00:30.599> obviously<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> end<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and then obviously at the end with the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
and then obviously at the end with the
big<00:00:31.890> bang<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.850> crystals<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> end<00:00:33.540> with

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
big bang the crystals at the end with

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.150 
big bang the crystals at the end with
the<00:00:33.780> big<00:00:33.960> banging<00:00:34.320> obviously<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.010> it's

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the big banging obviously because it's

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.490 
the big banging obviously because it's
just<00:00:35.219> light<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.090> shut<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.930> reflects

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
just light and shut you know it reflects

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
just light and shut you know it reflects
the<00:00:37.649> lights<00:00:37.860> etc<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.670> I'd<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> sort<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the lights etc and I'd like to sort of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
the lights etc and I'd like to sort of
slow<00:00:39.660> motion<00:00:40.110> lights<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.559> around<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> body

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
slow motion lights going around the body

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
slow motion lights going around the body
which<00:00:41.399> were<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:42.149> covered<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.780> crystal

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
which were actually covered with crystal

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
which were actually covered with crystal
I<00:00:43.350> love<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.010> makes<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.309> think<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I love the way it makes you think is the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
I love the way it makes you think is the
story<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> creation<00:00:45.629> basically<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.800> knew

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
story of creation basically we all knew

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
story of creation basically we all knew
that<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.879> Big<00:00:48.059> Bang<00:00:48.270> came<00:00:48.629> along

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that when the the Big Bang came along

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.799 
that when the the Big Bang came along
and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> stone<00:00:51.120> age<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and the and the and the stone age and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
and the and the and the stone age and
the<00:00:52.590> age<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> Apes<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> all<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the age of the Apes and all that and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
the age of the Apes and all that and
show<00:00:54.480> through<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> clothes<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.710> he

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
show through the clothes but then he

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
show through the clothes but then he
used<00:00:56.600> swarovski<00:00:57.859> swarovski<00:00:58.859> crystals<00:01:00.350> kind

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
used swarovski swarovski crystals kind

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
used swarovski swarovski crystals kind
of<00:01:01.530> interwoven<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> into<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> closer

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
of interwoven into the into the closer

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.609 
of interwoven into the into the closer
it<00:01:04.739> looked<00:01:05.040> wonderful<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.590> me

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it looked wonderful so I think for me

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
it looked wonderful so I think for me
I'll<00:01:08.520> also<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.909> way<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.090> mixed<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> crystal

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
I'll also the way we mixed the crystal

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.980 
I'll also the way we mixed the crystal
with<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> stones<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.409> an<00:01:10.530> embroidery<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.990> liked

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
with the stones as an embroidery I liked

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.190 
with the stones as an embroidery I liked
other<00:01:13.740> ways<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.280> using<00:01:14.400> crystal<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> way

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
other ways of using crystal and in a way

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.789 
other ways of using crystal and in a way
what<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> time<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> built

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
what I like this time was that we built

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
what I like this time was that we built
around<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> crystal<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.110> able

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
around the crystal in a way to be able

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
around the crystal in a way to be able
to<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:23.040> created<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> world<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> crystal

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to we created a world for the crystal

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
to we created a world for the crystal
and<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:25.560> exciting<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and that I think was very exciting and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
and that I think was very exciting and
he<00:01:26.759> had<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.090> clearly<00:01:27.390> three<00:01:27.689> stories<00:01:28.290> there

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
he had very clearly three stories there

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.940 
he had very clearly three stories there
was<00:01:28.680> no<00:01:29.220> rocks<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.030> transformed<00:01:30.780> into<00:01:31.049> into

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
was no rocks that transformed into into

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.149 
was no rocks that transformed into into
crystals<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> tapestry<00:01:34.829> type

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
crystals and and and and tapestry type

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.140 
crystals and and and and tapestry type
if<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.360> Hussein<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> only

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
if I I think Hussein is one of the only

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.520 
if I I think Hussein is one of the only
visionaries<00:01:39.150> still<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.479> fashion<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
visionaries still in fashion but the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
visionaries still in fashion but the
fantastic<00:01:41.130> thing<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> he<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> be

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
fantastic thing is he doesn't want to be

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
fantastic thing is he doesn't want to be
an<00:01:42.150> artist<00:01:42.270> he<00:01:42.509> wants<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.780> fashion

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
an artist he wants to be fashion

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.429 
an artist he wants to be fashion
designer<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.659> he<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.259> he's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
designer and so and he is but he's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.660 
designer and so and he is but he's
probably<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.100> who<00:01:47.280> pushes<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
probably the one who pushes the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.450 
probably the one who pushes the
boundaries<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> most<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.710> by<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.220> having

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
boundaries and the most so by by having

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.679 
boundaries and the most so by by having
the<00:01:50.549> evolution<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.240> by<00:01:51.360> having<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the evolution there or by having the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.929 
the evolution there or by having the
embroidery<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:53.070> took<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> crystal<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
embroidery you took the crystal and you

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.969 
embroidery you took the crystal and you
created<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> world<00:01:54.420> around<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.840> which<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> not

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
created a world around it which is not

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700 
created a world around it which is not
how<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> feel<00:01:56.820> most<00:01:57.240> people<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.600> use<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
how I feel most people would use it so I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
how I feel most people would use it so I
felt<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> interesting<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.630> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
felt like it was a interesting way of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.990 
felt like it was a interesting way of
tackling<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:02.009> comes<00:02:02.399> up<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.790> concept

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
tackling it he comes up with a concept

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149 
tackling it he comes up with a concept
and<00:02:03.390> his<00:02:03.479> whole<00:02:03.689> team<00:02:03.899> researches<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and his whole team researches it and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.040 
and his whole team researches it and
it's<00:02:05.969> very<00:02:06.210> different<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.630> know

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
it's very different to know

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's very different to know
well<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.470> wouldn't<00:02:08.100> say<00:02:08.220> normal<00:02:08.490> diner<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.120> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
well I wouldn't say normal diner but you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
well I wouldn't say normal diner but you
know<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.750> lot<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> people<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.530> go<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.310> trends

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
know a lot of people will go with trends

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700 
know a lot of people will go with trends
and<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.480> pallets<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.110> he<00:02:13.230> really<00:02:13.500> comes

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
and go with pallets and he really comes

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
and go with pallets and he really comes
up<00:02:13.890> with<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.270> conceptual<00:02:15.270> idea<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.870> then

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
up with a conceptual idea and then

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.570 
up with a conceptual idea and then
research<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.740> really<00:02:16.950> fully<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.400> goes

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
research is it really fully and goes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.100 
research is it really fully and goes
with<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.210> think<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.600> been<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> challenge

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
with that I think it's been a challenge

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
with that I think it's been a challenge
for<00:02:19.170> me<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.430> think<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.240> team<00:02:21.420> is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
for me and I think I think the team is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.720 
for me and I think I think the team is
very<00:02:21.750> open<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.280> been<00:02:23.430> good

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
very open and actually it's been good

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.910 
very open and actually it's been good
