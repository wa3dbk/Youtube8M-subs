00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 cleaned 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.560
 It can start immediately the little hunter 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.720
 offal ulla ostrich do with a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.320
 few hand grips you have one 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.030
 great food and if you are a hunter 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.340
 buy venison just ask 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 after one or the other will certainly 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.480
 the internees also like them 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.289
 cede 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.430
 Fried liver is available in many 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.199
 opponents on the plate 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.260
 but also want to prepare properly 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.820
 Will you know how to do it? 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.769
 they live on red deer which one can live in 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 reason to use this directly 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.830
 here from a narrow spieÃŸer so one 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.420
 there is no problem with that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.340
 Of course you have to pay attention to this 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 to remove the gallbladder and that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.000
 possible fully to once he something 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.360
 the bile juice has run over it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.680
 you prefer to step into the barrel 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.050
 from the liver I cut here now 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 Write down and here I will 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.410
 immediately continue to dice process 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.680
 go with all the inner so heart liver 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.270
 and kidney the kidney from older piece 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 and should be a bit better of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 you can also get younger pieces 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.350
 directly use it once along 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.890
 cut this white skin here 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.460
 pull down and then you see her 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.680
 they want to get their stuff out there 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.130
 Otherwise you do not need anything else 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.420
 do 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.890
 we are still a bit firmer 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.580
 structures that can be done quite well 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.530
 cut out so that s.schluss here 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.740
 only the kidneys 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.930
 he wants to remain, so to speak 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.930
 and you can then process it 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 Next , I cut the heart 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.239
 also write first around the discs 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.640
 then in cube small only in 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.200
 Strip then swirl all in rain 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.100
 Must go for the goulash in bite- sized 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.360
 happen to be cut 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.600
 whereas the sharp knife has and as 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.680
 Last come the dice from the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.110
 near editorial 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.230
 and so we have our little hunter 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.230
 turned right into bite-sized 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.910
 taste explosion onion you are allowed 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 in no good goller prefer to play 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.660
 too much as little is the currency 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.800
 the onions are peeled and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.690
 then into small cubes 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.880
 All ingredients are cut 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 cut prepares for armin 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.050
 hot pan of butter lard is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.830
 especially and to the country has to wait 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.290
 just not the water content here 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.960
 stopped bubbling as the heat 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.019
 so now liver and kidney, together with the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.019
 onions 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 requested 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.189
 only who gets really sharp turns 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.879
 hear juicy goulash over and over again 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.930
 otherwise trends 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.250
 because all meat surfaces 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.719
 are closed with a good one 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.389
 sip red wine 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.579
 afterwards with salt pepper paprika chilli 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.239
 earlier and a spoonful would be prices 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.239
 season and taste 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.370
 simmer for another three minutes in the sauce 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.330
 then never stir in cold 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.220
 avert water 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.879
 again performed then come on 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.879
 to do that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:09.290
 children speak the truth of 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:10.760
 smallest roof first try for big 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:19.459
 Hunter is allowed to hit it too 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:22.299
 be sure to try red wine 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.299
 to cook yourself
