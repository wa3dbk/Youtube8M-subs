00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.950
 today I taught super easy fantasy 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.889
 For me to leave you will need 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.920
 scissors one piece of elasticated glue 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 hot and everything I used four meters the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 What am I going to do now? 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.109
 the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.330
 and the child's waist with elastic 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.650
 cut and then speak the tips with glue 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.180
 hot 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 I have to put a lot to have 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.840
 sure you will not come back and then 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.029
 pressing with one of them is not very 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 hot then do not worry and then 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 let it rest to dry the width and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
 everything a little since then I 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.980
 simply organized in it because 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.989
 then immediately I'll take one of 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.219
 of the thulium has a base that I 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.079
 I chose by remembering that the width of the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.640
 work of a certain size of the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 length of the track either can be 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.309
 anything can be a cardboard can 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.110
 be free 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.210
 when you finish rolling all this 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.680
 club I'm going to take off from the base is actually 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 which suddenly has been taken away 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.760
 base I'm going to cut only one side is 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 all the tips on one side only 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 then I'm going to end up with several pieces and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 has twice the fulfillment that I want 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 to talk I'll get a piece of each 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.880
 time I will get my think I've got 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.290
 with the certainty that with this piece of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.240
 everything folded the stocking will make a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.210
 I need to pass the bills inside. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 relax and pull out coming out from underneath 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.750
 this hole you can understand 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.689
 I think it's easier to show everything. 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 stay but the process is easy and you 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.979
 doing this with each piece of tulle 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 giving around in the I think 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.490
 sometimes not even that will not roll anything but 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 subjecting care gives you to do 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.299
 resurface several times and always remember 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 right then that you are our 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.500
 doing everything to stay well and will 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.299
 paying everything right that was 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 my first lap of elastic and I 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.650
 I decided to add more, but time is 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.110
 a purple to be different from him 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.950
 and once again same process as before 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.649
 to cut 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.200
 I got lots of pieces and now I'm going 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 putting everything in purple between the pieces 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.869
 white tulle 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.880
 at first it can be a bit complicated 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.200
 because we will pulling white but will 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.299
 making slow doing and redoing 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.299
 taking our way and will give 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.360
 as I said pro cess scent 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.950
 real quick are you with Airton 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.179
 the next step then this is the part of 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.850
 Up the noise I got a bucket. 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.100
 white pen a notebook that will serve 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.069
 to separate a part of the neighborhood in the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.560
 from behind and he also had a piranha only 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.450
 to learn how the cuffs do not 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.709
 mess up what i'm doing 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.480
 You can use anything to 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.860
 put inside the neighborhood and hold back 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.290
 you can also opt for the same case 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.700
 know it was near here and then I 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.010
 I wanted to make your ghost face look 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.750
 pen I thought the five-time champion here 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.209
 suddenly it takes a long time 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.519
 so I took advantage of an eyeliner and 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.019
 I was already dry I was not there and went 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.790
 trying does not indicate that you do this 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.709
 It's better to buy more fabric paint 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.300
 I did not have it quickly surrounded by 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.850
 ghost 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.350
 and then just take out a direct notebook and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.910
 let it dry a little bit in fact I 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.890
 I spent some three makeup that was with 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.239
 fear of boring and fantasy to know 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.980
 super-fast baratinha easy to do 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.350
 It will even be up to me. 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.510
 I took to planner made some children 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.850
 and children in my fantasy girl is 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.410
 I had a good time, I left the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.360
 back a little longer because 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.430
 in fact I thought with a little 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.650
 long thai power on the front because he 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.120
 simply did not let me cut back 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.870
 I hope you have enjoyed the concierge 's
