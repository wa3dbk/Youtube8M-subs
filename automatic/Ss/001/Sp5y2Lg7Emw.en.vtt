00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
I really like the jewelry because I

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.490 
I really like the jewelry because I
think<00:00:26.740> it's<00:00:27.070> finished<00:00:27.430> very<00:00:27.670> well<00:00:27.910> and<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
think it's finished very well and the

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.000 
think it's finished very well and the
the<00:00:29.830> quality<00:00:30.040> of<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:30.610> stones<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.650> feel<00:00:32.890> very

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
the quality of the stones you feel very

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.700 
the quality of the stones you feel very
good<00:00:33.340> wearing<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.059> because<00:00:34.780> it's<00:00:35.110> not<00:00:35.350> just

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
good wearing it because it's not just

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.240 
good wearing it because it's not just
just<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.520> look<00:00:36.760> but<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.690> feeling<00:00:38.680> that<00:00:38.890> one

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
just the look but the feeling that one

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
just the look but the feeling that one
is<00:00:39.430> wearing<00:00:39.670> something<00:00:40.980> precious<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.520> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
is wearing something precious that is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.630 
is wearing something precious that is
complementing<00:00:43.870> one's<00:00:44.080> look<00:00:44.410> really<00:00:45.100> adds<00:00:45.309> to

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
complementing one's look really adds to

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.049 
complementing one's look really adds to
the<00:00:45.820> enjoyment<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.590> I<00:00:47.739> think<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.160> it's

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
the enjoyment of it and I think the it's

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.509 
the enjoyment of it and I think the it's
like<00:00:49.570> your<00:00:49.780> ears<00:00:50.080> are<00:00:50.530> still<00:00:50.800> there<00:00:51.070> they

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
like your ears are still there they

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.729 
like your ears are still there they
haven't<00:00:51.850> fallen<00:00:52.000> off<00:00:52.300> your<00:00:52.989> neck<00:00:53.290> you're<00:00:53.559> not

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739

about a headache so it's it's light

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.900 
about a headache so it's it's light
unlike<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.470> old<00:00:56.680> jewelry<00:00:57.130> which<00:00:57.460> was<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.790> be

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
unlike the old jewelry which was to be

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.810 
unlike the old jewelry which was to be
very<00:00:58.030> heavy<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:59.079> he's<00:00:59.260> got<00:00:59.530> the<00:01:00.040> old<00:01:00.280> design

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
very heavy so he's got the old design

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.350 
very heavy so he's got the old design
and<00:01:01.270> yet<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.290> comfortable<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.489> I<00:01:04.119> hope

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360

it<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:41.250> royal<00:02:42.250> era<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:43.060> Jaipur<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it to have that royal era of Jaipur and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.979 
it to have that royal era of Jaipur and
the<00:02:45.280> whole<00:02:45.459> architecture<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.810> history

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
of Jaipur so I think this is a very

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.610 
of Jaipur so I think this is a very
urban<00:02:52.180> approach<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:54.060> heritage<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.090> the

urban approach to the heritage and the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.729 
urban approach to the heritage and the
culture<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.830> our<00:02:57.129> country<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.120> Jaipur

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
culture of our country and Jaipur

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.199 
culture of our country and Jaipur
honestly<00:02:59.739> I'm<00:02:59.830> very<00:02:59.860> glad<00:03:00.129> of<00:03:00.400> being<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.030> part
