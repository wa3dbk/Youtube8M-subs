post-traumatic stress disorder which is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
post-traumatic stress disorder which is
a<00:00:52.590> problem<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.129> many<00:00:53.250> soldiers<00:00:53.640> come<00:00:53.820> back

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
a problem that many soldiers come back

a problem that many soldiers come back
from<00:00:54.360> battle<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.050> home<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:56.100> six<00:00:56.460> hours<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
from battle to home was six hours of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
from battle to home was six hours of
exercise<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.420> day<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.079> three<00:00:58.260> hours<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
exercise a day or up to three hours of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
exercise a day or up to three hours of
video<00:00:58.890> games<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.760> seems<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.359> video

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
video games and it seems like the video

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
video games and it seems like the video
games<00:01:00.930> themselves<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.680> sticky<00:01:02.460> because

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
games themselves are sticky because

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
games themselves are sticky because
you're<00:01:03.480> constantly<00:01:03.660> getting<00:01:04.290> feedback<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you're constantly getting feedback and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.800 
you're constantly getting feedback and
you're<00:01:05.309> working<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> edge<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.750> your

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you're working at the edge of your

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
you're working at the edge of your
capability<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.250> flow<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:09.270> also

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
capability so you have flow but also

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
capability so you have flow but also
because<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.960> play<00:01:10.380> them<00:01:10.560> oftentimes<00:01:10.979> in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
because now you play them oftentimes in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820 
because now you play them oftentimes in
communities<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> networks<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.650> can

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
communities and networks and so you can

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.469 
communities and networks and so you can
actually<00:01:14.159> bring<00:01:14.340> friends<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.939> through<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
actually bring friends in through the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.170 
actually bring friends in through the
internet<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.070> basically<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
internet and you can basically have a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.399 
internet and you can basically have a
community<00:01:18.659> around<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
community around these and that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.320 
community around these and that
connectedness<00:01:20.070> seems<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:20.670> important

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
connectedness seems to be very important

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
connectedness seems to be very important
and<00:01:22.020> even<00:01:22.530> using<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.890> technology<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.580> can

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and even using that technology you can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
and even using that technology you can
almost<00:01:23.820> use<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:25.200> wanna<00:01:25.320> say<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
almost use it as a I don't wanna say a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.050 
almost use it as a I don't wanna say a
diagnostic<00:01:26.159> tool<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.580> maybe<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.820> pre

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
diagnostic tool but maybe a pre

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.569 
diagnostic tool but maybe a pre
diagnostic<00:01:27.810> tool<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.110> rain<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.159> use<00:01:29.340> them

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
diagnostic tool and rain we use them

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.499 
diagnostic tool and rain we use them
both<00:01:29.759> ways<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.890> for<00:01:31.890> Diagnostics<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.240> use

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
both ways so for Diagnostics you can use

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
both ways so for Diagnostics you can use
that<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.079> technology<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.860> screen

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that kind of technology to screen

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.539 
that kind of technology to screen
somebody<00:01:36.090> who's<00:01:36.540> potentially<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.619> risk<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:38.430> a

position<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.619> sport<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.119> also<00:01:45.320> use

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
position in a sport but you can also use

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.429 
position in a sport but you can also use
it<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> teach<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:48.140> employ<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it to teach them to not employ that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.910 
it to teach them to not employ that
behavior<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.659> old<00:01:51.689> times<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.530> sports

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920

and<00:01:53.159> sports<00:01:53.460> medicine<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.149> would<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.990> would

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and sports medicine we would we would

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.760 
and sports medicine we would we would
mainly<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.829> explicit<00:01:56.549> learning<00:01:57.030> techniques

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
mainly use explicit learning techniques

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.319 
mainly use explicit learning techniques
yelling<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.920> somebody<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.579> coach<00:01:59.939> telling

yelling at somebody at coach telling
them<00:02:00.630> instructing<00:02:01.469> them<00:02:01.649> whereas<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.790> use

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
them instructing them whereas now we use

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
them instructing them whereas now we use
more<00:02:03.570> implicit<00:02:04.020> learning<00:02:04.259> techniques<00:02:05.100> such

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
more implicit learning techniques such

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
more implicit learning techniques such
as<00:02:05.700> giving<00:02:06.270> someone<00:02:06.479> biofeedback<00:02:07.229> having

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
as giving someone biofeedback having

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.490 
as giving someone biofeedback having
them<00:02:08.280> watch<00:02:08.610> themselves<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> behavior<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
them watch themselves do a behavior or a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.589 
them watch themselves do a behavior or a
movement<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.700> correcting<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
movement and then correcting that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.340 
movement and then correcting that
movement<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
movement and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.890 
movement and
and<00:02:13.440> showing<00:02:13.980> them<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> correct<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.940> corrected

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and showing them a correct a corrected

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.050 
and showing them a correct a corrected
type<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.410> maneuver<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.610> we're<00:02:17.790> finding

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
type of maneuver and what we're finding

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.740 
type of maneuver and what we're finding
is<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> becomes<00:02:19.050> much<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:19.830> effective<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
is that becomes much more effective and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
is that becomes much more effective and
you<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.870> people<00:02:22.230> talk<00:02:22.500> about<00:02:22.560> video<00:02:23.220> games

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you know people talk about video games

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.550 
you know people talk about video games
in<00:02:23.850> negative<00:02:24.270> terms<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.840> they<00:02:24.930> do<00:02:24.990> have

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
in negative terms and they do have

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.470 
in negative terms and they do have
negative<00:02:26.100> consequences<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:27.000> them<00:02:27.240> like

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
negative consequences to them like

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.020 
negative consequences to them like
sitting<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.020> couch<00:02:28.320> all<00:02:28.590> day<00:02:28.730> however<00:02:29.730> if

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
sitting on a couch all day however if

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.780 
sitting on a couch all day however if
you<00:02:30.600> use<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> video<00:02:31.350> game<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:32.100> Dance<00:02:32.550> Dance

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you use a video game like Dance Dance

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.360 
you use a video game like Dance Dance
Revolution<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.990> can<00:02:34.200> use<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.710> do<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
Revolution you can use it to do just the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.560 
Revolution you can use it to do just the
opposite<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.300> are<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> lot<00:02:36.540> of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
opposite so there are a lot of

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.740 
opposite so there are a lot of
opportunities<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:38.070> we<00:02:38.730> take<00:02:39.030> advantage

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
opportunities here if we take advantage

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.380 
opportunities here if we take advantage
of<00:02:39.870> them<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:41.070> things<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.550> motivate<00:02:42.090> kids

that are sticky that are addictive our

that are sticky that are addictive our
progressions<00:02:45.750> our<00:02:46.050> goal<00:02:46.380> settings<00:02:46.890> reaching

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
progressions our goal settings reaching

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.990 
progressions our goal settings reaching
the<00:02:47.610> next<00:02:48.030> level<00:02:48.930> into<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.530> vault<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.880> do

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the next level into that vault we can do

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
the next level into that vault we can do
the<00:02:51.150> same<00:02:51.450> thing<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:51.960> physical<00:02:52.500> activity

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the same thing with physical activity

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100 
the same thing with physical activity
programs<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.910> really<00:02:54.120> make<00:02:54.480> them<00:02:54.690> sticky

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
programs that really make them sticky

programs that really make them sticky
and<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.830> motivate<00:02:56.760> these<00:02:56.970> kids<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.690> do

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and really motivate these kids to do

sticky that means you make them do them

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.700 
sticky that means you make them do them
over<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.360> over<00:03:03.510> what<00:03:04.140> does<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.380> mean<00:03:04.560> make
