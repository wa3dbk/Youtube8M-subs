00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.000
 even from before the match between FC Excelsior initially stood as well 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 on the program last weekend but due to lack of police officers 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.390
 Nijmegen was not allowed to be played there, so it has shifted to 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.319
 tonight 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.400
 for as a pastor in the Koolwijk home a special will she moved this one 

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:21.499
 summer from pec itself short to the pdc 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.759
 this week the competition started with a draw against heerenveen has so much 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.269
 for popcap opening match day the city by commenting on feyenoord 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.010
 the competition is one of jan roelfs 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.060
 danaan bovenberg the captain of excelsior in the tenth minute it is one 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.320
 what 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 then start in the goffert 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.890
 where about 23 supporters traveled to Rotterdam to Nijmegen for a 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 team support 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310
 get out 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.310
 say the first feat in the first ten minutes 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 van steensel that comes well with yellow 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.310
 hefty tackle on stage 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.190
 to get this must be just red no intention to play the ball 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.450
 far too late tackle from behind 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.210
 according to the rules it is ad rolling 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 make the bushes 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.440
 that's handy says 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.930
 for what you jeanet 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.630
 The Netherlands you had only one thing is certainly not from the rider 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 follow the commitment of pfeiffer 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 the header after a good cross 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.480
 ramon summer 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 it's just passing by 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 researchers 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510
 whatever you want the ball in your feet 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.150
 an island nearby here is the netherlands 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.880
 father in the gallery 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 ball thrown 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.290
 and another good rescue of the the rider 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.329
 but still 0 0 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.129
 booty on adventure 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.269
 see it anyway 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.379
 the opportunity for feyenoord plays feyenoord 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
 a nurse option 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.939
 his hands are full of feyenoord 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.559
 by egypt 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.809
 for the picture if you are a spa now 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.099
 koolwijk 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.209
 supporting it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.639
 van de Velde 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.549
 jobs 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.149
 and the rider 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:03.849
 nsc soccer too nice 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.849
 but it falls in rounding it up to now 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 plenty of room for a swim in the sea 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.799
 van de velde the spurter on the right by choice on the road 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.919
 but many excelsior players are back in series 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.549
 veerman a lot of fireworks in the second half 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.279
 played almost fifteen minutes 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.669
 excelsior often on half of them in the sea 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.579
 but the team has not yet had a big chance, perhaps not upstairs 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.679
 and must lash out to test 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.679
 and the rescue of cillessen 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.569
 here that bang of brothers 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.919
 the fingertips of cillises 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.919
 prevent a goal from excelsior 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:10.119
 time is running out for energy 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.419
 from testing actually no right at all to a head start in view of the image 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.769
 from the second half 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.459
 the predominance excelsior not too many chances of better or better service 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.249
 this is a unique opportunity for the team on the right 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.710
 for feyenoord what do you mean 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.520
 simply year 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.999
 finally fulfilled 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.330
 and a soccer player in advance 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.330
 or the striker in a win 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.080
 and it is a liberating goal for charity 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 from alex pastor 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.249
 albergen 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.809
 cillissen can only watch 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:06.539
 van de Velde 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.539
 took the bench 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.969
 it's a second one 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.419
 platje and it happened in nijmegen 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.210
 no more training sessions in the store 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.919
 melvin flat 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.919
 read the first home game of a win here 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.439
 and so the Excelsior is defeated 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.339
 Roger Moore starts with two hits from Melvin Platje Jools and afterwards 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.279
 him 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.069
 that is also the case at other schools 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.549
 with both cities as martin pippa happy with the points 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.439
 as if you are not actually creating the real opportunities today 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.719
 Why take people in his career can not be completely recovered 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.339
 one hundred percent chances 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.879
 well i am glad i still know man 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.080
 That certainly for sure two weeks can score yourself 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.229
 a whole second half in but what I can do is harder than marcelo novum 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:12.269
 blame I have been there is ajax spoken yes then you are in the 

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:16.139
 made up for what I meant then the adventure pays off 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.129
 In addition to seeing a bag they have never been so confident 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.990
 fantastic to experience after the game but well what i say i am talking here too 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.300
 fantastic to my liking nothing for it is a beautiful city but it is not 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.740
 the split 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.130
 United is nice that the bid is rejected by and is a suggested one 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.080
 third bid 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.529
 one is awaiting buning of bone remnants this sentence 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:37.270
 of course 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.550
 with such a beautiful city but I see this mini with a rotten feeling as 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.380
 I don't look so pretty 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.460
 the romanian director for me is the ideal loved situation 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.009
 fc twente wants
