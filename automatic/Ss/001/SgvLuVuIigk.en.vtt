medium<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.250> full<00:02:30.519> coverage<00:02:30.550> um<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.680> build

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
medium to full coverage um you can build

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.539 
medium to full coverage um you can build
it<00:02:33.010> up<00:02:33.099> as<00:02:33.780> SPF<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.470> that's<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.890> little<00:02:36.010> extra

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
it up as SPF so that's a little extra

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.940 
it up as SPF so that's a little extra
even<00:02:36.790> though<00:02:36.879> it's<00:02:37.000> not<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:37.360> high<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.290> still

medium<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.739> full<00:02:44.890> coverage<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:46.049> that's<00:02:47.049> what<00:02:47.230> I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
medium to full coverage so that's what I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960 
medium to full coverage so that's what I
like<00:02:47.470> about<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.830> only<00:02:48.459> thing<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.940> I

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
like about it the only thing that I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.990 
like about it the only thing that I
don't<00:02:49.630> like<00:02:49.750> about<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.049> is<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.730> try

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
don't like about it is that when you try

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.449 
don't like about it is that when you try
and<00:02:52.060> apply<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.390> with<00:02:52.720> like<00:02:53.130> some<00:02:54.130> brush

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
and apply it with like some brush

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.780 
and apply it with like some brush
sometimes<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.720> would<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.560> wouldn't<00:02:57.099> work<00:02:57.549> out

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
sometimes it would it wouldn't work out

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.000 
sometimes it would it wouldn't work out
as<00:02:57.970> fine<00:02:58.299> like<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.810> doesn't<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.319> not<00:02:59.560> very

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
as fine like it doesn't it's not very

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.569 
as fine like it doesn't it's not very
easily<00:03:00.480> blendable<00:03:01.620> we'd<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:03.010> find<00:03:03.280> that

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
easily blendable we'd have to find that

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.460 
easily blendable we'd have to find that
particular<00:03:04.450> brush<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.840> actually<00:03:05.230> works

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
particular brush that actually works

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.140 
particular brush that actually works
well<00:03:05.709> with<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.040> foundation<00:03:06.610> because<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.030> you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
well with this foundation because if you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.630 
well with this foundation because if you
don't<00:03:07.329> then<00:03:07.540> you'll<00:03:07.690> have<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.989> streak

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
don't then you'll have that streak

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.729 
don't then you'll have that streak

Makeup Forever Matt one which is also

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.110 
Makeup Forever Matt one which is also
amazing<00:03:59.650> but<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.340> think<00:04:00.579> I<00:04:00.669> like<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.940> better

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
amazing but I think I like this better

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.729 
amazing but I think I like this better
because<00:04:01.329> i<00:04:01.510> feel<00:04:01.569> like<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.200> lasts<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> lot

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
because i feel like it lasts a lot

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.710 
because i feel like it lasts a lot
longer<00:04:02.799> even<00:04:03.639> though<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.060> mega<00:04:04.209> forever<00:04:04.569> has

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
longer even though the mega forever has

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.860 
longer even though the mega forever has
more<00:04:05.019> coverage<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:06.400> that's<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.209> that's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
more coverage so that's it that's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.330
