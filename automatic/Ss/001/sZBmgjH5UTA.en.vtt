to<00:02:06.210> grid<00:02:06.600> space<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.899> tall<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> actually

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
to grid space is tall when you actually

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.059 
to grid space is tall when you actually
put<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> widget<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.259> home<00:02:10.410> screen<00:02:10.440> but

selection of widgets to pick from you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.240

can<00:02:25.270> add<00:02:25.660> shortcuts<00:02:26.290> applications<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.220> can

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
can add shortcuts applications you can

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.530 
can add shortcuts applications you can
add<00:02:27.490> things<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:27.820> battery<00:02:28.330> temperature

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
add things like battery temperature

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.800 
add things like battery temperature
current<00:02:29.530> power<00:02:29.680> usage<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.850> also<00:02:31.150> can<00:02:31.450> add

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
current power usage you also can add

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.180 
current power usage you also can add
functions<00:02:32.590> such<00:02:32.950> as<00:02:33.660> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.660> switch<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:36.100> know

functions such as Wi-Fi switch you know

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.000

speakerphone switch all that stuff so

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.620

for<00:02:41.950> example<00:02:42.010> I've<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.120> added<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.480> couple

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
for example I've just added a couple

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.670 
for example I've just added a couple
icons<00:02:44.530> here<00:02:44.800> through<00:02:45.160> elixir<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.930> I'm

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
icons here through elixir and now I'm

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.870 
icons here through elixir and now I'm
not<00:02:48.160> going<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.340> mess<00:02:48.490> with<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.760> other

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
not going to mess with the other

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.430 
not going to mess with the other
settings<00:02:49.450> there<00:02:49.690> isn't<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> whole<00:02:49.930> lot<00:02:50.170> of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440

different<00:02:50.709> settings<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.130> sort<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:52.770> mess

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
different settings you can sort of mess

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.970

with<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.310> actual<00:02:54.760> size<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.300> icon<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.590> you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
with the actual size of the icon and you

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.580 
with the actual size of the icon and you
can<00:02:57.489> add<00:02:57.670> text<00:02:58.060> labels<00:02:58.600> or<00:02:58.840> not<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.260> text

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
can add text labels or not have text

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.740 
can add text labels or not have text
labels<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.150> was<00:03:01.300> going<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.540> go<00:03:01.600> ahead<00:03:01.660> and

labels but I was going to go ahead and
create<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:03.459> now<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.640> can<00:03:03.820> see<00:03:04.000> this

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
small space the only downsides but I

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.550 
small space the only downsides but I
have<00:03:23.200> with<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.410> one<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.959> can<00:03:26.380> be

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
have with it one is that it can be

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.020 
have with it one is that it can be
rather<00:03:26.709> confusing<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> figure<00:03:27.519> out<00:03:27.850> how

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
rather confusing to figure out how

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.280 
rather confusing to figure out how
exactly<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.709> widgets<00:03:30.250> are<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.580> look<00:03:30.850> in

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
exactly the widgets are going to look in

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.690 
exactly the widgets are going to look in
the<00:03:32.290> preview<00:03:32.709> because<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> preview<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.580> not

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
the preview because the preview is not

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.979 
the preview because the preview is not
really<00:03:34.000> sized<00:03:35.250> exactly<00:03:36.250> as<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:37.420> will<00:03:37.750> look

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
really sized exactly as it will look

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.240 
really sized exactly as it will look
when<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.380> actually<00:03:38.530> put<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:38.980> your<00:03:39.070> home

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250

when you actually put it on your home
screen<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.850> size<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.269> little<00:03:40.510> bit

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
screen the size is a little bit

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.280 
screen the size is a little bit
different<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:43.450> other<00:03:43.630> issue<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.989> have<00:03:44.110> with<00:03:44.140> it

different the other issue I have with it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.090 
different the other issue I have with it
is<00:03:44.410> simply<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.720> when<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:47.080> open<00:03:47.650> up<00:03:47.769> your
