00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
being floated as to why gas prices are

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000 
being floated as to why gas prices are
so<00:00:13.769> high<00:00:13.799> but<00:00:14.309> there<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.710> aren't

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so high but there is one that you aren't

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.920 
so high but there is one that you aren't
going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> hear<00:00:17.430> from<00:00:17.699> any<00:00:17.970> other<00:00:18.270> media

going to hear from any other media
around<00:00:19.260> town<00:00:19.560> Ben<00:00:20.100> has<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> reality<00:00:20.939> check

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.130 

well<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.300> true<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> number

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
well it is true that there are a number

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.169 
well it is true that there are a number
of<00:00:28.380> reasons<00:00:28.650> gas<00:00:29.039> prices<00:00:29.519> could<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:29.939> high

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
of reasons gas prices could be so high

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359 
of reasons gas prices could be so high
but<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> truth<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but if you really want the truth the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
but if you really want the truth the
answer<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.730> pretty<00:00:32.969> simple<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.079> very

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
answer is pretty simple but it's very

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.400 
answer is pretty simple but it's very
hard<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> fix<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:36.210> gas<00:00:37.140> is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
hard to fix and it's right here gas is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
hard to fix and it's right here gas is
so<00:00:37.620> expensive<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.760> dollar<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.450> not

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
so expensive because this dollar is not

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470 
so expensive because this dollar is not
worth<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> used<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.760> Fiat<00:00:42.210> dollar

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
worth what it used to be the Fiat dollar

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.720 
worth what it used to be the Fiat dollar
means<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> price<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> oil<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.579> up

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
means that the price of oil is going up

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
means that the price of oil is going up
and<00:00:44.940> there<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> no<00:00:45.690> real<00:00:46.110> way<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> bring<00:00:46.710> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and there is no real way to bring it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.549 
and there is no real way to bring it
down<00:00:47.070> without<00:00:47.610> dealing<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> value<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
down without dealing with the value of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
down without dealing with the value of
what<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.250> wallet<00:00:50.539> let's<00:00:51.539> start

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
what you have in your wallet let's start

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.770 
what you have in your wallet let's start
with<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> fiat<00:00:52.410> dollar<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> word<00:00:54.270> fiat

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
with what a fiat dollar is the word fiat

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.139 
with what a fiat dollar is the word fiat
is<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> Latin<00:00:55.770> meaning<00:00:55.920> let<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.969> done

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is from the Latin meaning let it be done

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
is from the Latin meaning let it be done
simply<00:00:57.870> meaning<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> value<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
simply meaning that the value of a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
simply meaning that the value of a
dollar<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.090> based<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.660> anything<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
dollar is not based on anything the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
dollar is not based on anything the
Federal<00:01:02.520> Reserve<00:01:02.609> prints<00:01:03.180> money<00:01:03.359> without<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
Federal Reserve prints money without a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
Federal Reserve prints money without a
standard<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.500> gold<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.949> silver<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.909> dollar

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
standard of gold or silver the dollar

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
standard of gold or silver the dollar
therefore<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.049> gets<00:01:07.439> its<00:01:07.590> value<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.580> nothing

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
therefore it gets its value from nothing

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630 
therefore it gets its value from nothing
other<00:01:09.180> than<00:01:09.510> government<00:01:10.049> decree<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.369> when<00:01:11.549> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
other than government decree so when you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
other than government decree so when you
print<00:01:11.909> money<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.110> money<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
print money and then more money and then

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
print money and then more money and then
more<00:01:14.010> money<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.820> value<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.479> each<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> every

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
more money the value of each and every

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.710 
more money the value of each and every
dollar<00:01:16.350> drops<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.850> why<00:01:18.000> does<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> mean<00:01:18.479> gas

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
dollar drops so why does that mean gas

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
dollar drops so why does that mean gas
prices<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.950> high<00:01:20.000> well<00:01:21.000> they're<00:01:21.330> high

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
prices are so high well they're high

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.050 
prices are so high well they're high
because<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> price<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.799> oil<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.880> high

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
because the price of oil is so high

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.530 
because the price of oil is so high
right<00:01:24.630> well<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.880> fact<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
right well actually it's not in fact the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
right well actually it's not in fact the
price<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.080> oil<00:01:28.259> according<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> recent

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
tell you this I was incorrect because if

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.170 
tell you this I was incorrect because if
oil<00:04:07.440> companies<00:04:07.980> refuse<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.610> sell<00:04:08.820> overseas

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
oil companies refuse to sell overseas

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.289 
oil companies refuse to sell overseas
and<00:04:09.750> they<00:04:10.110> kept<00:04:10.350> all<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:11.040> oil<00:04:11.220> here<00:04:11.730> it

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
and they kept all of that oil here it

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.840 
and they kept all of that oil here it
would<00:04:12.480> also<00:04:12.510> not<00:04:13.380> have<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> dramatic<00:04:14.070> effect<00:04:14.430> on

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
would also not have a dramatic effect on

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.539 
would also not have a dramatic effect on
gas<00:04:15.450> prices<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.859> here's<00:04:17.070> what<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.370> need<00:04:17.519> to

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
gas prices so here's what you need to

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.300 
gas prices so here's what you need to
know<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.450> solution<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.109> problem<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.739> in

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
know the solution to this problem is in

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.850 
know the solution to this problem is in
the<00:04:20.459> value<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:21.120> our<00:04:21.390> currency<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.650> know<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
the value of our currency you know the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.529 
the value of our currency you know the
price<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.070> gold<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.520> soaring<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.270> that

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
price of gold is soaring you know that

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.450 
price of gold is soaring you know that
but<00:04:24.870> do<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.080> realize<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.680> because<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
but do you realize that because the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.390 
but do you realize that because the
dollar<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.970> current

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
dollar is current

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.330 
dollar is current
the<00:04:27.520> floating<00:04:28.199> undefined<00:04:29.199> fiat<00:04:29.830> currency

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
the floating undefined fiat currency

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.820 
the floating undefined fiat currency
there<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.180> no<00:04:31.449> limit<00:04:31.840> on<00:04:31.930> how<00:04:32.020> far<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.530> price

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
there is no limit on how far the price

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.280 
there is no limit on how far the price
of<00:04:33.009> golden<00:04:33.370> dollars<00:04:33.669> can<00:04:33.850> rise<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.389> therefore

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
of golden dollars can rise and therefore

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.040 
of golden dollars can rise and therefore
there<00:04:35.889> is<00:04:35.919> no<00:04:36.310> ultimate<00:04:36.639> ceiling<00:04:37.509> on<00:04:37.690> gasoline

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
there is no ultimate ceiling on gasoline

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.320 
there is no ultimate ceiling on gasoline
