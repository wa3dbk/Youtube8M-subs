you really had to twist it hard to get

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
you really had to twist it hard to get
it<00:00:28.949> off<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.330> loosened<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.260> little<00:00:31.380> bit

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it off but I loosened it up a little bit

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.569 
it off but I loosened it up a little bit
so<00:00:31.969> doesn't<00:00:32.969> look<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> hard<00:00:33.450> anymore<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:35.370> um

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
so doesn't look that hard anymore but um

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
so doesn't look that hard anymore but um
basically<00:00:36.570> said<00:00:37.110> take<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> off<00:00:39.500> takes<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
basically said take this off takes a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.790 
basically said take this off takes a
little<00:00:40.770> while<00:00:42.230> believe<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
little while believe it or not the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.940 
little while believe it or not the
manual<00:00:44.579> knob<00:00:45.350> does<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:46.739> good

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
manual knob does have a pretty good

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.639 
manual knob does have a pretty good
weight<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:50.480> was<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.020> surprised<00:00:52.410> by

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
weight to it I was kind of surprised by

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.950 
weight to it I was kind of surprised by
it<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.420> didn't<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> weigh

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it I didn't think I was going to weigh

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.729 
it I didn't think I was going to weigh
that<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:56.449> but<00:00:57.449> yep<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.930> does<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> good

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that much but yep it does have a good

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.660 
that much but yep it does have a good
weight<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.899> which<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> probably<00:01:01.320> why<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
weight to it which is probably why the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.050 
weight to it which is probably why the
Miata<00:01:03.210> shifts<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.870> well<00:01:05.090> it's<00:01:06.090> pretty<00:01:06.930> heavy

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.060 

this<00:01:10.600> stock<00:01:11.110> shift<00:01:11.439> knob<00:01:12.869> stock

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

half<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> market<00:01:18.920> not<00:01:19.920> aftermarket<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.730> is<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
half the market not aftermarket one is a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.820 
half the market not aftermarket one is a
teeny<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:22.080> longer<00:01:23.690> than<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:25.020> UM<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.860> stock

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
teeny bit longer than the UM the stock

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.760 
teeny bit longer than the UM the stock
but<00:01:28.830> does<00:01:29.160> look<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.460> lot<00:01:29.700> cooler<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> would

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but does look a lot cooler that would

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.930 
but does look a lot cooler that would
say<00:01:32.390> Momo<00:01:34.820> Italia

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.990 

so<00:01:40.940> now<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:41.960> thing<00:01:42.710> about<00:01:42.740> these<00:01:43.220> uh

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
so now the thing about these uh

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.840 
so now the thing about these uh
shift<00:01:44.810> knobs<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:46.430> really<00:01:46.670> don't
