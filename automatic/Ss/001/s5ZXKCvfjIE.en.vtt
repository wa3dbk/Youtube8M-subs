00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.260
 Good afternoon people we are going to see now 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.689
 on the connection of transformer 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.250
 110 and 220 volts 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.160
 You may have noticed some 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.980
 apparatus is for example stabilizer of 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.849
 computer that behind it has a 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.380
 selector switch we do the attention 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.360
 that we are going to feed and 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.540
 establish this stabilizer 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.670
 other 110 or 220 volts 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.059
 we have to go to the care 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.609
 this type of device because it will 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.030
 outta 110 volts little key we will 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.620
 energizes into a 220 volt outlet 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.149
 we will burn the appliance as soon as 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.980
 people are calling as soon as we 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.320
 it is because he does not have to have 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.839
 careful with what was already a selector as 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.660
 the selector switch works inside 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.719
 it is connected to a transformer as 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.280
 three-wire or four children 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.320
 Now we'll see how the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.340
 connection of this transformer 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.070
 the transformer of three children is he has 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.020
 the two connection points in the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 ends and a third point 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.330
 which we call central derivation 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.330
 right in the middle of that moment of 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.660
 coil there is a third pin for us 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.200
 connect the primary of this transformer 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:33.270
 then this key is usually she's 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 connected in the primary transformer jewel 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.520
 the name of this key we give the name of 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.650
 h key as key piece works 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.350
 Let's suppose I went back there that 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.550
 voltage dividing line connecting in 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.720
 110 or I will connect this unit to 220 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.750
 volts what this little thing is going to do 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.390
 key h where it is positioned 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.840
 first it is positioned here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.550
 at that point and it will be still or 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.679
 She'll close on the dot here. 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.550
 leave marked as red 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.290
 good this key will close the middle 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.990
 the point that we are here we have 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.250
 the entrance is where you feed then 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.310
 here where goes to our outlet is a 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.600
 one part of the outlet wiring well 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.390
 direct 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 one of the live transformer clubs and 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.400
 another club will go through this key h 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.100
 then it will set whether it connects at the point and 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.030
 at it's good bind on the green dot 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.430
 if we make this key h by calling 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.580
 point came or we will stay 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.250
 feeding half of this transformer 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.840
 you agree then this is where we 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.820
 make food and 110 volts 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.460
 so when I call my plug 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 my input to 110 volts 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.300
 I'll change my sardine is 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.810
 110 position she will be calling you 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.710
 point on this red side and the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.210
 contrary 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.480
 let's assume that the power 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.540
 transformer is 220 then this 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.270
 key h will close the connection with our 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.220
 green dot when party connect with 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.530
 a green dot looks the way she 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.080
 will be following here 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.020
 it is fueling your attitude. 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:35.160
 transformer then from the green side to 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.160
 people feed at 229 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.140
 transformers to four children will 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.970
 understand what happens inside the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.910
 equipment or we know that 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.040
 110 220 volts to go to 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.380
 change any attention and what 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.550
 happens inside the connection of this 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.580
 transformer 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.060
 the four-wire primary transformer 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.950
 it is divided into two isolated coils 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.550
 here I am marking as the beginning of 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.510
 coil huffington bynum coil start 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.350
 2 of the coil 2 and each of these 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.320
 coils is built for 110 volts and 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.140
 after she makes leads 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.710
 and comes out only on two ends of 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.490
 a secondary we call this 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.680
 transformer in feces 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.949
 20 volts also exists since a 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:33.250
 gaga little key and we will have a source 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.250
 than 220 volts 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.389
 remembering what we saw in circuits 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.520
 there at the beginning of the course 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.430
 I have here I'll have an attention of 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.490
 220 volts to power a coil that 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.259
 has to reach 110 and another coil that has 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.199
 reach 110 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.180
 Do you agree if I put 220 direct 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.280
 in a coil that can only reach 110 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.500
 I'm going to burn the coil of 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.770
 transform the pain so i can not do 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.039
 the direct connection of a 220 coil which 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.190
 can only receive 110 which is the type of 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.550
 The connection we make to this tension 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.159
 total power will be divided 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.250
 between the two reels I'm going to play the year 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.259
 of 2010 is that it will only take 110 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.770
 and this one will get the rest that is the 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.259
 holy is the bond then inserts 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.199
 very simple to connect to 220 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.690
 in this transformer one of the output phase 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:33.650
 here at the beginning of coil 1 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.860
 the other phase comes at the beginning or excuse 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.550
 comes at the end of coil 2 and this point here 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.280
 O 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.680
 the people together makes call connection 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.800
 inserts we are putting two 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.710
 coils and what happens with 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.180
 attention on the circuit in video 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.400
 half for each 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.770
 provided that these values ​​are 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.940
 same they have the same value of 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.280
 resistance 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.819
 in the case of the transformer, the 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.460
 two power coils to connect 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:07.819
 this transformer in 110 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.219
 just think the same way in the circuits 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:17.409
 we will have a power here O 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:21.710
 two 110 volt wires 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:24.889
 I have one of 110 and remembering that 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.389
 was manufactured for 110 volts 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.039
 so what do I have to do to get 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.419
 my source of energy and send it straight 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.940
 in her 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.280
 This one here was also manufactured in percent 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.740
 the others then I also get this 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.940
 source of energy and send this coil 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.920
 of low 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.290
 What kind of connection is this? 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.140
 People already come the connection circuits in 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:48.290
 is parallel then I'll get one of the 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.720
 I'll tell you about my food and send it 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.020
 there at the beginning one of the coil 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:58.640
 and that same tip I'll send it on 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:01.040
 start coil 2 and now I'll get the 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.180
 other power supply 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:10.400
 I'll send it to the end of the ubi at one and I'll 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:12.560
 at the end of the coil when the 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.440
 people do this, it's as if we have 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.430
 catching that I took the first obina 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.730
 I picked up the second coil beginning of the coil 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:26.840
 one with beginning of the coil 2 and sends one 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:30.950
 phase of coil 1 with the end of the coil 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:33.940
 two and sent another phase makes neutral is the 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:38.020
 fact is phase three farmers who 110 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.020
 two coils in parallel
