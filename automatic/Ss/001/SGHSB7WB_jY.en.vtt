machine but I haven't soda yet so it's
kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.200> I'll<00:01:58.409> ripped<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
kind of just like I'll ripped and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.520 
kind of just like I'll ripped and
flailing<00:01:59.610> all<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.479> looks<00:02:00.659> really

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
flailing all about and it looks really

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.070 
flailing all about and it looks really
bad<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.159> um<00:02:02.610> yeah

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
bad but um yeah

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.350 
bad but um yeah
see<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.950> cut<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.150> back

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
see it's just like cut up in the back

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.520 
see it's just like cut up in the back
and<00:02:07.970> yeah<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.600> accentuates<00:02:10.290> like

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and yeah it just really accentuates like

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
and yeah it just really accentuates like
woman's<00:02:10.950> shoulders<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> that

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
woman's shoulders and I think that that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.870 
woman's shoulders and I think that that
looks<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:13.200> good<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.860> don't<00:02:14.190> know<00:02:14.280> why<00:02:14.460> US

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
looks really good I don't know why US

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.520 
looks really good I don't know why US
women<00:02:15.360> don't<00:02:15.570> accentuate<00:02:16.050> our<00:02:16.170> shoulders

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
women don't accentuate our shoulders

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.650 
women don't accentuate our shoulders
more<00:02:17.190> often<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.970> think<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.480> looks

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
more often but I think that it looks

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.770 
more often but I think that it looks
really<00:02:19.050> good<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.550> paired<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.330> shirt

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
really good and I just paired this shirt

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.730 
really good and I just paired this shirt
with<00:02:21.960> some<00:02:22.170> high-waisted<00:02:22.440> shorts<00:02:23.540> these<00:02:24.740> it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
with some high-waisted shorts these it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.050 
with some high-waisted shorts these it
looks<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.160> weird<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.900> um<00:02:28.110> yeah

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
looks really weird like this but um yeah

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
some high-waisted black shorts it's kind

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.110
