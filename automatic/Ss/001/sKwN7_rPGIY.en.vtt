red dot it's going to be yellow so what

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.770 
red dot it's going to be yellow so what
I'm<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.640> try<00:02:33.820> to<00:02:33.850> do<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.510> another

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
I'm going to try to do now is another

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.980 
I'm going to try to do now is another
tactic<00:02:35.320> here<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:36.100> put<00:02:36.970> myself<00:02:37.150> behind<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.900> little

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
tactic here I put myself behind a little

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.580 
tactic here I put myself behind a little
tree<00:02:39.690> put<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.030> glyph

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.680 

from<00:02:45.920> aspect<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.610> beast<00:02:46.879> so<00:02:47.300> makes<00:02:47.569> me

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
from aspect of the beast so makes me

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.100 
from aspect of the beast so makes me
untrackable<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.970> these<00:02:50.300> hunters<00:02:50.599> can't<00:02:50.900> see

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
untrackable so these hunters can't see

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.600 
untrackable so these hunters can't see
that<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.349> here<00:02:52.300> also<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.920> last<00:02:55.160> while<00:02:55.430> I've

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
that I'm here also the last while I've

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.670 
that I'm here also the last while I've
been<00:02:55.640> using<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.239> glyph<00:02:56.989> obtained<00:02:57.319> beasts

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
been using the glyph obtained beasts

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.630 
been using the glyph obtained beasts
minor<00:02:58.099> lift<00:02:58.400> these<00:02:58.580> are<00:02:58.700> both<00:02:58.819> minor<00:02:59.060> lifts<00:03:00.640> to

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
minor lift these are both minor lifts to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.259 
minor lift these are both minor lifts to
reduce<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:02.120> time<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.360> danby's<00:03:03.080> by<00:03:03.260> 4<00:03:03.470> seconds

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.479 

so<00:03:08.269> they<00:03:08.450> can't<00:03:08.689> see<00:03:09.019> me<00:03:09.099> my<00:03:10.099> time<00:03:10.129> will<00:03:10.459> be

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
so they can't see me my time will be

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.899 
so they can't see me my time will be
faster<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.799> behind<00:03:12.799> this<00:03:12.950> tree<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.670> if

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
faster and behind this tree so that if

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.350 
faster and behind this tree so that if
he<00:03:14.030> does<00:03:14.060> look<00:03:14.450> down<00:03:15.310> hopefully<00:03:16.310> he<00:03:16.519> won't<00:03:16.849> see

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
he does look down hopefully he won't see

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.190 
he does look down hopefully he won't see
see<00:03:18.170> me<00:03:18.370> something

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
see me something

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.039 
see me something
put<00:03:21.200> him<00:03:21.319> on<00:03:21.349> focus<00:03:21.769> just<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.069> can<00:03:22.129> see<00:03:22.400> if<00:03:22.489> he

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
put him on focus just so I can see if he

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.410 
put him on focus just so I can see if he
targets<00:03:24.049> me<00:03:24.200> she<00:03:24.409> does<00:03:24.620> fly<00:03:25.190> away<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.180> can't

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
targets me she does fly away so I can't

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.630 
targets me she does fly away so I can't
kill<00:03:26.599> him<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.829> I'll<00:03:28.040> sit<00:03:28.250> here<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.519> wait

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
kill him and I'll sit here and wait

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.490 
kill him and I'll sit here and wait
because<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.180> bear<00:03:29.510> usually<00:03:29.989> spawns<00:03:30.319> right

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
because this bear usually spawns right

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.340 
because this bear usually spawns right
up<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:31.659> just<00:03:32.659> right<00:03:32.870> up<00:03:33.019> down

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.350 

now<00:03:36.350> we<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.740> an<00:03:36.920> alliance<00:03:37.250> 90<00:03:37.940> hunter

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
been looking for hiding spots I found

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.420 
been looking for hiding spots I found
this<00:03:55.120> one<00:03:55.360> it's<00:03:55.510> kind<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.750> cool<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:57.250> on

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
this one it's kind of cool it's just on

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.190 
this one it's kind of cool it's just on
the<00:03:57.459> other<00:03:57.549> side<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.569> river<00:03:58.720> where<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.080> was

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
the other side of the river where it was

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.780 
the other side of the river where it was
I<00:03:59.409> was<00:03:59.530> hiding<00:03:59.860> behind<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.280> tree<00:04:00.459> right

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
I was hiding behind that tree right

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.670 
I was hiding behind that tree right
there<00:04:02.700> before<00:04:05.040> up<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.849> hill<00:04:07.090> just<00:04:07.690> north

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
there before up on the hill just north

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.199 
there before up on the hill just north
of<00:04:08.890> sits<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.690> lodge<00:04:10.959> it's<00:04:11.409> right<00:04:11.650> back<00:04:11.799> there

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
of sits the lodge it's right back there

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.360 
of sits the lodge it's right back there
there's<00:04:13.209> this<00:04:13.299> bigger<00:04:13.750> tree<00:04:14.140> with<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.739> bush<00:04:15.010> in

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
there's this bigger tree with a bush in

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.289 
there's this bigger tree with a bush in
it<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.049> figure<00:04:17.470> well<00:04:17.699> I'll<00:04:18.699> go<00:04:18.940> into<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
it so I figure well I'll go into the

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.460 
it so I figure well I'll go into the
bush<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:21.100> I'll<00:04:21.220> feign<00:04:21.489> death<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:26.080> found<00:04:26.350> a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
bush and I'll feign death and I found a

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.740 
bush and I'll feign death and I found a
way<00:04:26.500> that<00:04:26.770> she<00:04:26.949> falls<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.580> left<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.600> I

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
way that she falls to the left so if I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.420 
way that she falls to the left so if I
start<00:04:29.289> with<00:04:29.320> my<00:04:29.500> left<00:04:29.710> towards<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.160> tree

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
start with my left towards the tree

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.360 
start with my left towards the tree
she'll<00:04:30.610> fall<00:04:30.820> into<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.180> tree<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:33.010> that's<00:04:33.250> a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
she'll fall into the tree so that's a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.180 
she'll fall into the tree so that's a
good<00:04:33.520> hiding<00:04:33.789> spot<00:04:34.060> kind<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.600> guess<00:04:35.190> with

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
good hiding spot kind of I guess with

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.840 
good hiding spot kind of I guess with
aspect<00:04:36.850> me<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.330> don't<00:04:37.479> get<00:04:37.539> tracked<00:04:38.850> let's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
aspect me so you don't get tracked let's

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.189 
aspect me so you don't get tracked let's
see<00:04:40.000> if<00:04:40.060> we<00:04:40.150> can<00:04:40.270> find<00:04:40.419> more<00:04:40.630> hiding<00:04:40.960> spots

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
see if we can find more hiding spots

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.890 
see if we can find more hiding spots
while<00:04:41.380> we<00:04:41.590> wait
