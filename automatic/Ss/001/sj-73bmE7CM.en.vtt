00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:07.450
 in lego marvel super hero it will give itself up 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.630
 the heroes, so to speak, the building blocks in 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.820
 hand over 100 characters from the 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.610
 world of marvel comics start at dr 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.980
 to keep dom magneto dog and co off 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.619
 from the components surfboards the silver 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 surfer to build a superweapon with the 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.060
 they can subjugate the world 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.590
 starting point of the lego adventure 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.360
 marvel typical manhattan that as free 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.640
 walkable connecting piece between the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.920
 individual missions acts on the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.770
 different places like us 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.410
 cart the asteroid m the estate of 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.649
 professor expedia or the dark tower 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.950
 leads in the following ten we beat 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.360
 us through the high security prison 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.690
 in which some of the blocks 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 use super villains 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.730
 in the team of three a man is squatting 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.399
 and wolverine by one of leader 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.290
 initiates a rebellion in its course 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.689
 some lego henchmen in their 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.860
 items are disassembled 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.590
 sounds brutal and would be with everyone 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.960
 another game for a usk 18 worry 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.539
 but here it is more likely to make you smile 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.369
 if the poor and legs of the bad guys after 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.890
 a good fight over the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.330
 ground down 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.039
 something bad in spite of the three 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.140
 team members is the game only on 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.450
 maximum two players at the same time 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.100
 designed either simultaneously 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.170
 a screen or over the net 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.390
 go out 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.000
 similar to lego batman 2 dc 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.250
 superheroes are the levels peppered with 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.170
 small teamwork puzzles and objects 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.310
 only with one of the three figures 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.950
 to interact 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.929
 therefore, constant change is announced 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.729
 and who outside of the story mode with 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.580
 unlocked by figures again 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.420
 running can even be unreachable before 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.420
 discover secrets 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.979
 Wolverine , for example, can thank you for that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.810
 his adam anti around claws brittle 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.549
 tear down walls and on certain 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.259
 put vertically in the height to climb 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.299
 for example, for the others 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 unreachable switches and repel 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.410
 to open locked doors 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.250
 if, on the other hand, you can be the only figure 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.650
 of our team computer consoles 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.170
 and power lines manipulate so 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.940
 about the battery of villain whiplash too 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 overloaded 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.260
 The strong lego must have one then 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.060
 pull thick block out of the wall because 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.030
 the other two too weak for such 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 tasks are always standing up 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590
 the way through the mission too 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 boss fighting, for example, with magneto 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.670
 Lots of junk on our lego 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.470
 Heroes throw and who asks what here 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.230
 from our third one the member 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.420
 The man has now become short 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.400
 previously undressed by magneto and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.720
 Unfortunately, this leaves the level 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.760
 a little later it's in jail 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.690
 Courtyard against wood intim enemy 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.190
 nomination 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.140
 First, the heroes must 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.450
 searchlight on the monster 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.360
 then the fist fight against the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.000
 Started monstrously start while the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.680
 rather a short quicktime event is that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.410
 as a player, by the way, at least 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.930
 should lose once to see how 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.170
 Tronic be sneaky combination 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.170
 can 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.940
 lego batman 2 dc superheroes was already 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.280
 cool 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.620
 but lemgo marvel super hero it seems 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.680
 one more idea is the only one left 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.140
 Marvel's cult authors Stanley as 90 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.360
 year old superhero to install 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.000
 in which almost all abilities of the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.820
 marvel universe club makes us that 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.020
 play very sympathetic and otherwise 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.700
 can be found for all tastes 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.220
 matching heroes and villains 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.350
 who has not always wanted that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.720
 grim panic than happy lego 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.940
 admire figure 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.490
 So who as a building block superhero the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.980
 want to save the world is very doll 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.680
 look forward to the release on 15 november 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.110
 or nets that fill the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.820
 swing next lego store and that 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.320
 unfortunately still quite manageable 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.320
 plunder marvel assortment
