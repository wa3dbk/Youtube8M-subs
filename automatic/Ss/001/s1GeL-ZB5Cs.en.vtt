 as if in the arena home hockey arena 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.610
 club word just alternates goalkeepers 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.549
 coaches ask myroslav shatan on your 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.670
 the screens right in the middle it's still 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.340
 not a game or countries are very good with them 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.590
 relationship is clear that on hockey 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 the site 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 this friendship is forgotten and vice versa 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 those others want to win 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.570
 Thief tick transfer to the penny and not two 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.930
 the puck misses the goal but brilliant 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.969
 acts Jaroslav Jan again thief snip 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.160
 washers and again a great pass one more 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.300
 throw and again gorgeous safe 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.300
 Yaroslav anus 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.910
 includes playing time he is here 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.790
 top scorer of the team and what 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:00.700
 moment 5 pulls out the puck 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:04.199
 you are in the history of this tournament very, very 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.180
 active 5 on 4 plays 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.570
 words will not do it apparently 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.439
 for 2 minutes Vishnevsky 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.439
 scores 10 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.410
 missed 10 words he comes forward 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.870
 best samples but nonetheless 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:31.260
 bad words to martin said no 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:35.990
 it was well, and he got quite the opposite 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.990
 the chance to play at home here this mass 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.409
 very tightly with the barbell and the score becomes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.409
 20 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.100
 but again close the review tomashka 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.150
 perlite and due to this occur 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 Lego goalkeeper problems 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.830
 the school is on the patch 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.830
 actually as an observer 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.659
 but the cast then which barbell falls 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.350
 the puck only then back tomash rested and 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.760
 after that it turns into sects 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.220
 a little bit the players didnâ€™t seem to run 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.650
 forward and now they need to hold back 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.320
 the city of chicago lever is leaving for the gates of it 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.170
 on the snout are not allowed Kris step dancing 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.170
 what moment it clogs them 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.980
 12 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.710
 but what we talked about at the beginning 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.170
 we are meeting opposite 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.540
 but rules gate washer yanus also 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.400
 well done he had time to react to this 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.280
 situation but on the patch sd on farm not 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.560
 Weathered two defenders words on and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.950
 but actually from pure ice put 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.840
 throwing on the interception wrong Vishnevsky 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.520
 Well, immediately correct your mistake again 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.930
 come back to the whole team what gear 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.360
 before her throw 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.360
 right in the hall tomash rested 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.549
 the moment they control the step across the board there 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.019
 harsh and finally berna 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.999
 Harsh transfer to the center is excellent 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.709
 connection throw and finishing moves should 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.799
 follow on this time lucky and and 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.990
 Jose on the contrary is not lucky and will follow 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.250
 and counterattacks by the words on 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.840
 knock down bortovik now let's 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.990
 look again he is chaos 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.090
 rushes to her even a little bit 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.400
 enough for him there to pass this 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.430
 the puck is comfortable and already sent to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.130
 empty net and immediately counterattack in 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.890
 performance of the word on the board gets rich 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.600
 under my anus and there it didnâ€™t go 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.490
 the ground fight that gear in execution 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.750
 cucumber gai new getting tea we 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.750
 almost makes out a double 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.400
 but here and sand the second pace came out and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.049
 if 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.909
 cast yet completed it would be altogether 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.579
 cool and now counterattack words on 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.579
 what moment can i 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.790
 Motrich washer good gear on 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.290
 Piglet there Lepi Omsk missed as 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.290
 lion advocates are generally incomprehensible 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.000
 Well, now counterattack bar. coming off 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.760
 puck violin fails to throw throw 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.190
 and our pepero years you cant spend it but 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.100
 cutie . 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.230
 slinks one two lion players vs 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.910
 players like the usa goes to the guests and 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.860
 what moment can now arise and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.490
 Bernard moves forward and not she 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.490
 going to 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.760
 here I gave my native debt 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.220
 crusts 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:47.090
 good gear does have to throw i am 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:50.270
 the nose managed to catch this puck 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.500
 did weathered late found kristensen 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.810
 sketch of that 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.850
 It turned out not in the least plays 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.560
 the kid's team now and then 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.660
 opportunity your own zones 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.830
 sends the puck to 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.190
 it does not help the market 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.230
 Chad wins 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.460
