your computer and you can install it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.950 
your computer and you can install it
that<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.510> it's<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.750> expensive

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that way so that it's a little expensive

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
that way so that it's a little expensive
though<00:00:52.350> since<00:00:52.800> thirty<00:00:53.070> dollars<00:00:53.489> plus<00:00:53.699> ten

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
though since thirty dollars plus ten

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.430 
though since thirty dollars plus ten
dollars<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.980> brig<00:00:55.980> white<00:00:56.190> flash<00:00:56.460> drive<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
dollars for a brig white flash drive is

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.520 
dollars for a brig white flash drive is
not<00:00:58.940> $69<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> said<00:01:00.329> forty<00:01:00.809> dollars<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.469> i

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
not $69 but it said forty dollars but i

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.399 
not $69 but it said forty dollars but i
guess<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> plus<00:01:02.129> make<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:02.489> money<00:01:02.699> from<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
guess a plus make some money from it and

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
guess a plus make some money from it and
this<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.189> making<00:01:05.640> money

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
this kind of the way up making money

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.780 
this kind of the way up making money
since<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> look<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:08.580> still

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
since if you look at it it's still

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.160 
since if you look at it it's still
cheaper<00:01:09.240> than<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.510> buying<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> copy<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
cheaper than like buying a copy of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960 
cheaper than like buying a copy of
windows<00:01:10.560> windows<00:01:10.830> CD<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.430> i<00:01:11.490> guess<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
windows windows CD so i guess it's not a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.200 
windows windows CD so i guess it's not a
big<00:01:12.360> deal<00:01:12.799> but<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.060> more

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
big deal but it is a little bit more

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.840 
big deal but it is a little bit more
money<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.740> yourself<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.820> own

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
money and you can make yourself your own

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
grow in one of these things since

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
grow in one of these things since
they'll<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.189> cheaper<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.479> ten<00:01:30.659> dollars

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
says different so but smaller which is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.020 
says different so but smaller which is
good<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.590> some<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.100> bad<00:02:47.220> for<00:02:47.430> some<00:02:47.640> but<00:02:47.970> at

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
good for some and bad for some but at

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.060 
good for some and bad for some but at
least<00:02:48.090> gives<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> two<00:02:48.690> options<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.010> want

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
least gives the two options so if I want

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.620 
least gives the two options so if I want
a<00:02:50.160> bigger<00:02:50.370> screen<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.000> get<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.570> you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
a bigger screen and you get it and you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.410 
a bigger screen and you get it and you
want<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> smaller<00:02:52.140> screen<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.530> get<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.830> so

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
want a smaller screen you can get it so

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.150 
want a smaller screen you can get it so
and<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.900> pretty<00:02:55.050> expensive<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.800> least<00:02:55.950> one

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
and it is pretty expensive at least one

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.760

that<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.700> Amazon's<00:02:57.150> website<00:02:57.350> it's<00:02:58.350> like

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
that is on Amazon's website it's like

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.550 
that is on Amazon's website it's like
605<00:02:59.580> British<00:03:00.180> pounds<00:03:00.630> which<00:03:00.780> translates<00:03:01.350> to

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
605 British pounds which translates to

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.150 
605 British pounds which translates to
believe<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:03.230> thousand<00:03:04.230> us<00:03:04.590> are<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:05.100> a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
believe like thousand us are just a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.590 
believe like thousand us are just a
little<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.460> less<00:03:05.760> than<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.480> pretty

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
little bit less than that so it's pretty

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.140 
little bit less than that so it's pretty
expensive<00:03:07.070> avoid<00:03:08.070> or<00:03:08.190> only<00:03:08.340> know<00:03:08.550> which<00:03:08.730> model

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150

expensive avoid or only know which model
oven<00:03:09.390> 3g<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> could<00:03:10.440> be<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.710> as<00:03:10.920> 32<00:03:11.489> or<00:03:11.640> 64

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
going to be as low as I can pretty much

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.320 
going to be as low as I can pretty much
get<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.650> which<00:04:24.770> does<00:04:25.100> make<00:04:25.130> sense<00:04:25.550> in<00:04:25.820> since<00:04:26.150> it

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
