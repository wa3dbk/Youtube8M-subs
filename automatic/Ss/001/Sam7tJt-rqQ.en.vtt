00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
inside artwork into my 300 steelbook

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.440 
inside artwork into my 300 steelbook
that's<00:02:50.220> how<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.430> turned<00:02:50.640> out<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.299> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that's how it turned out that's just a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.229 
that's how it turned out that's just a
clip<00:02:51.810> from<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.170> film<00:02:52.319> there<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> think<00:02:54.060> it

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
clip from the film there so I think it

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.569 
clip from the film there so I think it
