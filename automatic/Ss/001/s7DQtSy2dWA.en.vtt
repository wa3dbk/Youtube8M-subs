00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.520
 box 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.539
 and good we go 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.539
 yes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.580
 as we see 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.640
 well protected is very important 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.640
 important 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.199
 to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.930
 we see is a box 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.160
 with finishes 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.530
 artistic of the Templar range as 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.950
 can be whites combined with 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.950
 the blacks 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.810
 we see the finishes with the logo of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.810
 templars 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.079
 and the aerocon logo 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.479
 with the rods for re recorders 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.479
 both the bluray and the dvd as of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.390
 easy to extract the important 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.390
 we see here the power button 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.010
 the reset button the indicator 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.830
 switched on 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:42.980
 a 3.0 usb direct to the board 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.600
 a microphone to plug in the microphone 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.570
 the headphones 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 1 sb 2.0 usual 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.610
 we see here the two grids for the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.660
 12 centimeters fans 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.390
 we can put both 2 on the sides as 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.470
 one in the center 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.470
 of 14 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.410
 let's open it 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 it's more 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 we see that it is quite broad inside 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.970
 so we can put cards 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 pretty big graphics that are the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.010
 common among the gamer community and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.040
 the screws 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.800
 very well classified putting in each 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.800
 site for what each one serves 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.840
 we sit with instructed bridles that 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.879
 that is to be grateful 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.480
 to be able to have everything more organized and 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.480
 collected 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.980
 and an adapter to be able to put better 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.980
 the two 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.560
 here we see the pods 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:25.569
 for the two future 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.330
 both of 3.5 that are the usual in 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.930
 tower computers like to 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.040
 put them the 2.5 hard drives that are 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.040
 the regulars of laptops 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.140
 here there are four inside there is one 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.550
 I find it hard to find 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.550
 I'll put 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.660
 as the most usual connections 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.670
 except the 3.0 how good is it 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.510
 Now putting enough in the boxes 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.510
 for black 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.900
 the audio connector usb connector 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.340
 and led indicators and reset buttons and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.800
 of power 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.660
 we see the two bays for those of 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 recorders very easy to put on and 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.880
 life of so many screws 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.190
 and good we see that it includes fans 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.800
 we see that the power supply goes 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.229
 down here what is very usual in the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.539
 gaming and mobile boxes 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.849
 we see that it includes a small filter that 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.490
 we can retire and globally when 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:52.139
 full of dust so that to prevent that 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.139
 the power supply gets dirty 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.270
 because the power source is 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.800
 prone to catch enough dust 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.800
 with this we will avoid 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.990
 we see here that it would be ready for something 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.990
 in the replication tubes 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.930
 the bays for the species 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.800
 the connections output from the motherboard 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.020
 and good 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.020
 and we have seen the opposite ferrum 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.160
 two 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.990
 and well we see that it is a box with 

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:47.580
 Finishes in white very beautiful and 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.580
 totally metal 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.850
 it's pretty 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.760
 well up here in today's boxing we 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.890
 we will see 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.890
 you liked it and keep visiting
