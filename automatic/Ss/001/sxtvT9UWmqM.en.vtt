00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.740
 there is an attitude and commenting and you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.930
 I bring a modern warfare gameplay 2 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.540
 I finally know that many are where they move 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.959
 warfare 2 that I leave 1 is a nuclear 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.120
 when I play for teams of 16 in hand I know 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.849
 that is not my favorite weapon as you know 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.189
 although in this game I do not but I have a 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.920
 special love to me 16 so I have 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.420
 tell you a little something about a special 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.160
 that I have thought are nostalgic but 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.160
 good the watts map 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.230
 I played it and well I know you have a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.030
 Special love this game because many 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.660
 of you good for many others was 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 your first game and also for 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.120
 some was the first videos that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.770
 I started to know when this was born 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.810
 youtube not when the first youtuber 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 they started uploading videos and such that 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.780
 it was between modern warfare 2 and black ops 1 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 more or less then it's like it started 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 a little the fashion of youtube with the new 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.280
 of Claudio tico in this game with the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 black ops 1 so well I'll comment 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.430
 a little bit as you know how always 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 the game in the shits that my opinion 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 in this game there are a couple of very 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.129
 very large especially one of them and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 surely good is there other than between 60 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 he eliminated it because there is no 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 but also talk about it because my 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.450
 ps3 you also suffer quite a lot and good 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.940
 that shit that I'm talking about 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.369
 he's just a hacker in between 60 I have not seen 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.920
 absolutely no hacker in what I've 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.420
 been able to play for a long time the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.160
 true one that just as they have put 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.780
 name of total colors but none 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.940
 person saving immortal rare things 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 of those the truth is that I have not seen like that 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.400
 that is a point is a favor to play it 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 between 60 that there is no problem in 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.220
 that aspect then we have both 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 loaded deadly of this game the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 first is the chameleon combo 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.930
 grenade launcher near danger that is 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.360
 that if they are not 10 out of 10 games in 910 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 matches there's a guy throwing canutos like 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.660
 I call it kikos as you want to call it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.310
 that they just threw it to the go that I 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.720
 ask sometimes for example in this 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.880
 gameplay I'm lucky to have another 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.410
 team I do not know if there were any but so 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.810
 except they do not throw it to me but like today 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
 yes they sound they sound and I do not know if it is that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.539
 they were pulling some partner that I know 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 that some teammate had thrown the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.110
 but I do not know if there were also some of the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.520
 enemy team pulling the then is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.509
 playing a couple of games and more fucked up 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.830
 a couple of more nuclear with 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.210
 grenade launcher if you do not know what I 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.030
 bust that they kill me with a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.170
 grenade launcher or I have already seen in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.299
 other episodes this series that they play 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 light not because I remembered on the streak 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.300
 but ski 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.940
 is that it makes me very badly done or is it what 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.480
 worse that can happen to me 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.920
 what's the worst done to me because this 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.600
 let's analyze the weapon in but in 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.190
 grenade launcher is a weapon that has a 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.650
 radius of action with the near period 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 awesome you do not need to see uncle 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 to kill him you can kill him tip to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.630
 point of the map because it has the edges 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 random air that you're sure to kill 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.770
 someone does not run out the bullets is 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.440
 infinite with the chameleon so then 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.270
 infinite bullets and sincerely you're 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.620
 too shocked is that it is not 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.000
 You can compete with them if you have seen 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.739
 a time pitcher nothing if it's 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.690
 fairly skillful because I think that 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.750
 that weapon is not any skill you're going to 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.310
 kill yes or yes so the big one is the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.750
 hit in this game and so it gives a lot 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 I hate to play it right now other than 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.620
 the hacker that presents there is not but I 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.940
 I put in a rights when this game 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.350
 basically that's why I like the rest 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.700
 I really like weapons very much 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.260
 leveled maps are pretty good 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.019
 there is someone else who is too long 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.340
 but good as in all the rubbers 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.769
 there always has to be some map 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.959
 radillo there is no such but I do not know is a 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.550
 slope and that I like in quotes 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.800
 enough or I liked it a lot before and that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.630
 now I hate because of the fact that 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.150
 throw anything according to you tell me 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.880
 It annoys you a lot because of the ones loaded 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.470
 I have many analyzes, that is, not 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.420
 it's been said that it bursts me a lot and it's 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.500
 what I hate most of any game 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.390
 any shooter that has me one 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.430
 tickets I can not stand it I hate it we go 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.510
 totally then then in others 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.010
 problems also that we have to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.240
 Sometimes you can fuck some ranchillo 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.850
 can bother is the issue of gusts 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.400
 of death that we will also continue in 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.050
 warfare 3 and recorded by finally removing 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.460
 in the good of a white only they had not 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.430
 whites or they definitely removed them and 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.110
 in things have not returned those for example 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.060
 the final battery that remained the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.970
 uncle lying down as you have seen before or the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.770
 analgesic that was tripling by three you 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.110
 health is to say a lot during 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.870
 a few seconds is that is to say if you 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.310
 you find a guy with an analgesic every 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.930
 face you have 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.310
 let's go as it was not very manco kill you 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.720
 but sure we go with the year that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.490
 you have weapons in this game with force 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.960
 during which is another of the things that 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.340
 saw this game the vulnerable force 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.740
 that from one thing one removed 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.120
 weapons that do not have other years too 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.860
 damage but that adding strength a 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.570
 go ahead then if they have damage and kill 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.890
 alright then if you wanted to play with a 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.080
 murderer in this case coldblooded or 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.790
 any other advantage of the style 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.450
 you had to take strength in front of you and 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.830
 make 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.510
 Well, what does your sister tare - so 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.640
 it is a point in his favor and good 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.980
 finally to conclude is this 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.210
 starting as you see the last casualties with 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.320
 better in the helicopter and the hardware 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.670
 I wish and I think it kills one and the 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.560
 helicopter killed very few touched to command 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.480
 almost everyone to weapon here as a brave 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.230
 you'll see that they mention a lot of 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.520
 this 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.570
 He solving ended with raisins with 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.200
 shotgun that in this game were 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.910
 secondary and good to tell you that I have 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.040
 thought a great special for the series 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.570
 I do not know whether to save it for 50 or so 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.460
 I have several specials thought 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.860
 regarding the issue of weapons ie a 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.000
 top of 10 favorite weapons a touch of 10 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.950
 best weapons of all heats 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.240
 saying is some statistics and such 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.250
 of weapons some of other curious 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.530
 of real life and also make a 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.180
 vote among you to also 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.830
 your best weapons and your weapons 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.060
 favorite say what would be mine and what 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.980
 that it would be yours to see if there are many 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.390
 differences I will do more in the 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.650
 next gameplay of whites 1 since 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.760
 I will have much more time this has already been 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.380
 finished so well I hope it gets 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.940
 liked both example and the comment 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.770
 and he liked it because they do like me 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.770
 favorites that there was more
