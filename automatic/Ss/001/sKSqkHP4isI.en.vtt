00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
shotgun and this thing's pretty good

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
shotgun and this thing's pretty good

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it's got the highest impact and range

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
it's got the highest impact and range
out<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.800> any<00:00:26.220> shotgun<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> game<00:00:27.240> besides

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
out of any shotgun in the game besides

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
out of any shotgun in the game besides
the<00:00:28.230> bronze<00:00:28.529> cast<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.160> will<00:00:29.400> show<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the bronze cast which will show you in a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.389 
the bronze cast which will show you in a
second<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> default<00:00:31.980> version<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
second and so the default version of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.830 
second and so the default version of
this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> pretty<00:00:32.850> good<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.329> feel<00:00:33.540> choked

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this is pretty good it's got feel choked

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
this is pretty good it's got feel choked
it's<00:00:34.079> got<00:00:34.200> return<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> sender<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.610> got

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's got return to sender it's got

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
it's got return to sender it's got
hammer<00:00:36.120> forged<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> range<00:00:37.170> finder<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.620> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
hammer forged and range finder so you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
hammer forged and range finder so you
got<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> lot<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.070> range<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
got a lot of range with it you get a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
got a lot of range with it you get a
little<00:00:39.329> bit<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> ammo<00:00:39.930> back<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.440> this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
little bit of ammo back with this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
little bit of ammo back with this
default<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.450> rolled<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.230> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
default one but the one I rolled so I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
default one but the one I rolled so I
bought<00:00:43.500> two<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> default

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
bought two of these I got the default

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
bought two of these I got the default
one<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.510> wanted<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> roll<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.680> with

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
one and then I wanted to roll one with

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.190 
one and then I wanted to roll one with
shot<00:00:47.100> package<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.940> shot<00:00:48.300> package<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
shot package so shot package is going to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
shot package so shot package is going to
reduce<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.980> spread<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.719> shooting

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
reduce your spread so it's like shooting

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.520 
reduce your spread so it's like shooting
a<00:00:52.170> cannon<00:00:52.559> off<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.010> short-range<00:00:53.969> cannon<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a cannon off a short-range cannon and I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
a cannon off a short-range cannon and I
got<00:00:55.920> final<00:00:56.699> round<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.480> hammer<00:00:57.719> forged

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
got final round on it with hammer forged

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.369 
got final round on it with hammer forged
and<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:59.129> thing<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.579> note<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and a thing to note on this is that the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
and a thing to note on this is that the
linear<00:01:01.559> compensator<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.760> field<00:01:03.000> show

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
linear compensator and the field show

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
linear compensator and the field show
that<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.809> doesn't<00:01:04.140> make<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> difference<00:01:04.739> if

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that really doesn't make a difference if

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
that really doesn't make a difference if
you<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.309> hammer<00:01:05.549> forged<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.869> can

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you have hammer forged on it as you can

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
you have hammer forged on it as you can
see<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> video<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:08.070> hammer<00:01:08.549> forged

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
see in the video because hammer forged

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
see in the video because hammer forged
maxes<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> range<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.790> probably

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
maxes out the range so it's probably

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
maxes out the range so it's probably
better<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.390> use<00:01:12.720> may<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:12.990> aggressive

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
better to use may be aggressive

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.210 
better to use may be aggressive
ballistics<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.490> something<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:16.220> now

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
ballistics or something like that now

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280 
ballistics or something like that now
the<00:01:17.729> final<00:01:18.119> round<00:01:18.270> perk<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.170> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the final round perk I really like this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
the final round perk I really like this
perk<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.400> field<00:01:20.610> scout<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> field

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
perk and a field scout so the field

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840 
perk and a field scout so the field
Scouts<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.130> pde<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
Scouts one you want to use in pde if you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.780 
Scouts one you want to use in pde if you
get<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.900> pretty<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
get it so that's pretty good but the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
get it so that's pretty good but the
definitely<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> shop

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
definitely you want to do the shop

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.969 
definitely you want to do the shop
package<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.759> hammer<00:01:29.939> forged<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.110> final

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
package and the hammer forged the final

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
package and the hammer forged the final
round<00:01:32.130> part<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.030> usually<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> down<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
round part so usually I get it down to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
round part so usually I get it down to
one<00:01:34.320> shot<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.909> thirty

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
one shot and it's going to do thirty

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.640 
one shot and it's going to do thirty
three<00:01:36.390> percent<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.869> damage<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.380> last

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
three percent more damage on that last

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.480 
three percent more damage on that last
shot<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.360> when<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> happens<00:01:40.170> you're<00:01:41.070> really

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
shot and when that happens you're really

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
shot and when that happens you're really
going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> massive<00:01:42.600> amount<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> damage

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
going to do a massive amount of damage

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
going to do a massive amount of damage
now<00:01:44.189> right<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.000> comparing

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
now right here you can see I'm comparing

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420 
now right here you can see I'm comparing
it<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> bronze<00:01:45.869> kazma<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> get

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
it to the bronze kazma which you can get

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.270 
it to the bronze kazma which you can get
in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> new<00:01:48.000> crucible<00:01:48.600> playlist<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:50.040> got

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
in the new crucible playlist and I got

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
in the new crucible playlist and I got
lucky<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> drop<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.479> shot<00:01:51.899> package

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lucky I got it to drop with shot package

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
lucky I got it to drop with shot package
it<00:01:52.350> doesn't<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.860> hammer<00:01:53.159> forged<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.880> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it doesn't have hammer forged but it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
it doesn't have hammer forged but it's

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
two they're going to change some of the

two they're going to change some of the
weapon<00:03:38.700> types<00:03:38.910> how<00:03:39.510> they<00:03:39.720> deal<00:03:39.960> damage<00:03:40.200> with

weapon types how they deal damage with

weapon types how they deal damage with
their<00:03:41.130> effective<00:03:41.520> ranges<00:03:42.030> blahdy<00:03:42.930> blahdy

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
their effective ranges blahdy blahdy

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.140 
their effective ranges blahdy blahdy
blah<00:03:43.410> how<00:03:44.310> our<00:03:44.460> shotguns<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> be

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
blah how our shotguns going to be

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.850 
blah how our shotguns going to be
affected<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.690> svelte<00:03:45.960> winter<00:03:46.260> slides<00:03:46.530> still

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
affected so svelte winter slides still

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.370 
affected so svelte winter slides still
worth<00:03:47.100> getting<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.510> answer<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.810> yes<00:03:48.930> so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
worth getting and the answer is yes so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.560 
worth getting and the answer is yes so
the<00:03:49.500> range<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.160> be<00:03:50.250> reduced<00:03:50.580> in<00:03:51.000> both

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
the range is going to be reduced in both

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.980 
the range is going to be reduced in both
PVE<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.080> pvp<00:03:52.550> but<00:03:53.550> in<00:03:53.670> PvE<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.450> damage<00:03:54.840> is

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
PVE and pvp but in PvE the damage is

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.470 
PVE and pvp but in PvE the damage is
going<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.200> be<00:03:55.380> doubled<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.850> how<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.270> use

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
going to be doubled so how do you use

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.650 
going to be doubled so how do you use
this<00:03:57.690> thing<00:03:57.990> in<00:03:58.170> PvE<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.850> when<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.480> have<00:04:00.600> a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
this thing in PvE and so when you have a

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.410 
this thing in PvE and so when you have a
slow<00:04:01.170> rate<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.500> fire<00:04:01.680> weapon<00:04:02.340> whether<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.270> in

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
slow rate of fire weapon whether it's in

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.920 
slow rate of fire weapon whether it's in
PvE<00:04:03.810> or<00:04:04.320> PvP<00:04:04.980> you're<00:04:05.970> going<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.150> deal<00:04:06.390> bursts

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
PvE or PvP you're going to deal bursts

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.520 
PvE or PvP you're going to deal bursts
of<00:04:07.050> damage<00:04:07.500> now<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.550> between<00:04:09.000> shots<00:04:09.530> you're

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
of damage now in between shots you're

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.990 
of damage now in between shots you're
not<00:04:10.680> dealing<00:04:10.890> anything<00:04:11.430> you're<00:04:11.730> vulnerable

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
not dealing anything you're vulnerable

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.270 
not dealing anything you're vulnerable
you're<00:04:12.450> going<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> be<00:04:12.690> taking<00:04:13.080> damage<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.980> how

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
you're going to be taking damage so how

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.800 
you're going to be taking damage so how
do<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.580> minimize<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.330> need<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.630> take

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
do you minimize that you need to take

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.460 
do you minimize that you need to take
cover<00:04:16.080> in<00:04:16.350> between<00:04:16.739> shots<00:04:17.040> weave<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.120> out

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
cover in between shots weave in and out

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.180 
cover in between shots weave in and out
now<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.650> felt<00:04:19.980> winter<00:04:20.250> sly<00:04:20.660> going<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.810> be

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
now is felt winter sly going to be

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.000 
now is felt winter sly going to be
useful<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.280> PvP<00:04:23.940> after<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.630> update<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
useful and PvP after the update and the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.610 
useful and PvP after the update and the
answer<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.400> yes<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.810> guys<00:04:28.020> got<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> remember

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
answer is yes you guys got to remember

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.040 
answer is yes you guys got to remember
that<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.160> shotgun<00:04:29.780> outperforms<00:04:30.780> out

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
that this shotgun outperforms out

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.159 
that this shotgun outperforms out
classes<00:04:31.919> every<00:04:32.520> other<00:04:32.820> shotgun<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.870> game

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
classes every other shotgun in the game

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.290 
classes every other shotgun in the game
and<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.040> it's<00:04:35.190> still<00:04:35.370> going<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.550> be<00:04:35.610> really

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
and so it's still going to be really

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.840 
and so it's still going to be really
really<00:04:36.540> useful<00:04:37.200> even<00:04:37.890> if<00:04:38.160> they<00:04:38.340> reduce<00:04:38.669> the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
really useful even if they reduce the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.560 
really useful even if they reduce the
range<00:04:39.030> by<00:04:39.510> maybe<00:04:39.890> 15<00:04:40.890> 20<00:04:41.190> 30<00:04:41.550> percent<00:04:42.000> it's

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
range by maybe 15 20 30 percent it's

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.230 
range by maybe 15 20 30 percent it's
still<00:04:42.810> going<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.140> be<00:04:43.230> very<00:04:43.500> effective<00:04:43.860> now<00:04:44.820> how

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
still going to be very effective now how

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.570 
still going to be very effective now how
you<00:04:45.300> use<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.810> shotgun<00:04:46.050> it's<00:04:46.650> really<00:04:47.400> good

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
you use the shotgun it's really good

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.550 
you use the shotgun it's really good
right<00:04:47.760> now<00:04:47.790> with<00:04:48.090> blink<00:04:48.419> I<00:04:48.780> think<00:04:49.320> it's<00:04:49.470> a

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
right now with blink I think it's a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.140 
right now with blink I think it's a
little<00:04:49.680> too<00:04:49.830> good<00:04:50.280> as<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.700> can<00:04:50.820> see<00:04:50.970> in<00:04:51.060> the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
little too good as you can see in the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.270 
little too good as you can see in the
video<00:04:51.450> but<00:04:52.380> we'll<00:04:52.620> see<00:04:52.800> how<00:04:52.830> they<00:04:53.070> deal<00:04:53.250> with

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
video but we'll see how they deal with

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.060 
video but we'll see how they deal with
it<00:04:53.640> even<00:04:53.820> if<00:04:54.180> they<00:04:54.419> reduce<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.169> range<00:04:55.410> by

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
it even if they reduce the range by

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.550 
it even if they reduce the range by
fifteen<00:04:56.820> twenty<00:04:57.180> thirty<00:04:57.360> percent<00:04:57.780> you're

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
fifteen twenty thirty percent you're

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.920 
fifteen twenty thirty percent you're
dealing<00:04:58.919> so<00:04:59.190> much<00:04:59.460> damage<00:04:59.850> at<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.300> short<00:05:00.660> range

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
dealing so much damage at a short range

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.440 
dealing so much damage at a short range
that<00:05:01.800> yes<00:05:02.070> you<00:05:02.310> can<00:05:02.580> take<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.880> blade<00:05:03.120> answer

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
that yes you can take a blade answer

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.620 
that yes you can take a blade answer
down<00:05:03.570> if<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.050> aim<00:05:04.200> at<00:05:04.380> their<00:05:04.560> head<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:06.360> so

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
down if you aim at their head and so

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.760 
down if you aim at their head and so
you're<00:05:06.840> going<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.230> play<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:07.470> little

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
you're going to have to play a little

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.370 
you're going to have to play a little
smarter<00:05:08.490> with<00:05:08.640> shotguns<00:05:09.150> once<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.200> patch

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
smarter with shotguns once the patch

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.230 
smarter with shotguns once the patch
comes<00:05:10.620> out<00:05:10.919> you're<00:05:11.130> not<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.700> be<00:05:11.789> able<00:05:11.820> to

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
comes out you're not going to be able to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.820 
comes out you're not going to be able to
perhaps<00:05:13.140> blink<00:05:13.710> toward<00:05:13.979> them<00:05:14.220> rush

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
perhaps blink toward them rush

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.880 
perhaps blink toward them rush
and<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.370> beeline<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.720> get<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.140> kill<00:05:17.380> maybe<00:05:17.740> you

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
and a beeline and get the kill maybe you

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.110 
and a beeline and get the kill maybe you
have<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.160> maneuver<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.610> little<00:05:18.790> bit<00:05:18.880> more<00:05:19.060> to

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
have to maneuver a little bit more to

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.980 
have to maneuver a little bit more to
get<00:05:19.510> in<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:19.750> close<00:05:20.170> proximity<00:05:20.940> area<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.510> I

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
get in that close proximity area and I

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.690 
get in that close proximity area and I
think<00:05:23.050> that's<00:05:23.320> a<00:05:23.530> good<00:05:23.680> change<00:05:24.010> will

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
think that's a good change will

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.150 
think that's a good change will
obviously<00:05:25.030> know<00:05:25.420> for<00:05:25.690> sure<00:05:25.960> when<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.620> update

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
obviously know for sure when the update

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.490 
obviously know for sure when the update
drops<00:05:27.460> but<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.570> don't<00:05:28.840> think<00:05:28.990> you<00:05:29.170> guys<00:05:29.350> have

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
drops but I don't think you guys have

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.900 
drops but I don't think you guys have
anything<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.980> worry<00:05:30.190> about<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.460> think<00:05:30.760> it's

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
anything to worry about I think it's

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.520 
anything to worry about I think it's
actually<00:05:31.210> going<00:05:31.330> to<00:05:31.420> make<00:05:31.570> crucible<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.200> little

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
actually going to make crucible a little

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.260 
actually going to make crucible a little
bit<00:05:32.680> more<00:05:32.890> enjoyable<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.640> little<00:05:34.030> bit<00:05:34.120> more

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
bit more enjoyable a little bit more

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.180 
bit more enjoyable a little bit more
competitive<00:05:34.870> which<00:05:35.410> is<00:05:35.440> always<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.890> good<00:05:36.130> thing

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
competitive which is always a good thing

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.940 
competitive which is always a good thing
