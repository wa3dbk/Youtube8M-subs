00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.520 
mock scenarios it has done very well my
only<00:03:39.010> complaint<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.959> low<00:03:40.959> ammo<00:03:41.349> capacity

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
only complaint is the low ammo capacity

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.530 
only complaint is the low ammo capacity
again<00:03:42.160> you're<00:03:42.370> limited<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.790> six<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.269> clip

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
again you're limited to six in the clip

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.430 
again you're limited to six in the clip
and<00:03:44.340> one<00:03:45.340> inside<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.669> chamber<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:47.109> know

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
and one inside the chamber and you know

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.930 
and one inside the chamber and you know
I<00:03:48.989> mean<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:51.010> could<00:03:51.190> have<00:03:51.340> thought<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:51.700> if<00:03:51.819> you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
I mean what could have thought is if you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.530 
I mean what could have thought is if you
need<00:03:52.180> more<00:03:52.389> than<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:53.049> say<00:03:53.319> 12<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.099> 13

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
need more than so say 12 and 13

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.180 
need more than so say 12 and 13
you<00:03:55.959> know<00:03:56.079> bullets<00:03:56.500> you're<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.709> trouble<00:03:56.919> but

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
you know bullets you're in trouble but

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.550 
you know bullets you're in trouble but
if<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.370> ever<00:03:57.459> done<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.299> mock<00:03:59.139> scenario

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
if you ever done that in a mock scenario

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.220 
if you ever done that in a mock scenario
that<00:03:59.859> goes<00:04:00.069> very<00:04:00.370> quickly<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.150> I'm<00:04:01.959> going<00:04:02.169> to

that goes very quickly so I'm going to

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.039 
that goes very quickly so I'm going to
decide<00:04:02.470> my<00:04:02.769> next<00:04:03.129> one<00:04:03.489> I'm<00:04:04.480> gonna<00:04:04.629> keep<00:04:04.870> this
