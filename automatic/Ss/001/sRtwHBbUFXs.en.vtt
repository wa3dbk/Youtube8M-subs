multi-player<00:02:19.430> before<00:02:20.430> waiting<00:02:21.420> until<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
multi-player before waiting until the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.809 
multi-player before waiting until the
game<00:02:22.110> finally<00:02:22.709> releases<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.459> think<00:02:23.700> that

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
game finally releases and I think that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.089 
game finally releases and I think that
is<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> fair<00:02:24.330> amount<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.989> time<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.379> play<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.010> if

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
is a fair amount of time to play so if

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.680 
is a fair amount of time to play so if
you<00:02:26.160> want<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.430> play<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.700> early<00:02:26.970> preorder<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
you want to play it early preorder the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.300 
you want to play it early preorder the
game<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:28.019> now<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.560> whatever<00:02:28.739> system<00:02:29.220> you

finally<00:02:31.680> comes<00:02:31.920> out<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.370> actually<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
finally comes out I actually think this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.699 
finally comes out I actually think this
is<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.360> good<00:02:33.599> move<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.989> believe<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
is a good move I believe this is the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.370 
is a good move I believe this is the
first<00:02:35.099> time<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.730> public<00:02:36.060> multiplayer<00:02:36.870> beta<00:02:37.080> has

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
first time a public multiplayer beta has

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
first time a public multiplayer beta has
been<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.130> Call<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.310> Duty<00:02:38.640> correct<00:02:39.209> me

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
if I'm wrong if event if advanced

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
if I'm wrong but I think this is a very

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.670 
if I'm wrong but I think this is a very
good<00:02:45.150> move<00:02:45.330> by<00:02:45.569> Treyarch<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.260> it's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
good move by Treyarch and it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.350 
good move by Treyarch and it's
definitely<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.519> give<00:02:47.700> people<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.120> taste

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
definitely going to give people a taste

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.190 
definitely going to give people a taste
for<00:02:48.599> what's<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> come

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
for what's to come

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.650 
for what's to come
and<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.739> will<00:02:49.830> definitely<00:02:50.010> reel<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.540> of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and it will definitely reel in a lot of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.120 
and it will definitely reel in a lot of
pre-orders<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.980> best

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
pre-orders because one of the best

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.979 
pre-orders because one of the best
things<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.269> things<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.630> Trac

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
things one of the things that Trac

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.750 
things one of the things that Trac
definitely<00:02:55.560> needs<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.920> look<00:02:56.069> out<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.579> how

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
definitely needs to look out for is how

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.610 
definitely needs to look out for is how
many<00:02:56.910> pre-orders<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.720> snag<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
many pre-orders they can snag and I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.050 
many pre-orders they can snag and I
think<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.099> very<00:02:59.340> good<00:02:59.579> marketing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
think this is a very good marketing

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.089 
think this is a very good marketing
strategy<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:01.079> I'm<00:03:01.290> definitely<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.769> board

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
strategy because I'm definitely on board
