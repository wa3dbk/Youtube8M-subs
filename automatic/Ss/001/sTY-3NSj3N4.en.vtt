00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 when summer is here and with the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 eagerness to get dark and I am the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.940
 first I want to go black there 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 than having a leader with a sun because 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.830
 skin has memory and we can not be 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.480
 using tanning oils that we 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
 burn but yes it is true that there 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.789
 food or juice that we can drink and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.369
 eat that can enhance our 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.939
 melanin and so look for this tan from 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.939
 miami beach 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 the first trick I do is to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.960
 prepare the skin for the sun because what 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.450
 that we see that before the season 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.730
 To take a lot of sun, I plundered it well 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.980
 skin in this way we remove the skin 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.770
 dead and what we leave is new skin 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.510
 that new skin tans and so we 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 The color of the exfoliator lasts longer 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 it can be the one you always use or 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.800
 well a natural one that you can do with 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.960
 the coffee grounds mixed with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.170
 oil and you apply it by massaging 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.449
 circular another very important trick is 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 start to get dark little by little 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.899
 periodically 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 that is, with short exposures 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.190
 day you can not arrive and the first day of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.890
 beach being like a crab from the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.900
 10 until 7 because at the end away from 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.759
 get brown the only thing you get 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 is that you drop the skin to chubs 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.020
 It is also super important from the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.720
 first moment to protect you very well 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 the skin with food no doubt 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 some is one of the most key points 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.830
 to have a good tanning food 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.630
 like the eggs the fish the celery or the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.450
 Spinach can help us a lot 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.770
 Besides, we can also keep very 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.259
 okay the line with these foods 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.200
 traded but the jewel in the crown are 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.940
 two tumbles that I love and also 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 to be very good will strengthen our 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.730
 melanin the first one is made 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 with a carrot 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.610
 150 grams of tomato and 100 grams of 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.890
 red peppers this juice is very 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.110
 nutritious and it's great to kill the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 worm so mid morning to mid 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.300
 late and we also help you with our 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.860
 tanning is good for health the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.990
 second juice I love it because it's 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.690
 super cool and ideal for the days of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.210
 summer heat is composed of a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 orange one lemon one carrot one 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.380
 teaspoon of oil what we do is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.000
 put everything in the blender also 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.370
 we can put a little ice and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.570
 so we are cool and ready to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 take and the last super key point is 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.250
 hydration is important that after 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.890
 of the solar exposures we throw ourselves 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.200
 our usual moisturizer and this 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.570
 not only will it help us maintain the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700
 tanning but also help 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.470
 soothe the skin punished by 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.050
 solar exposure to me I commented it up 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.690
 use is aloe vera because 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.800
 of being a super natural element 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.230
 moisturizing 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.540
 It is very cool ideal for the heat 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.490
 right now I'm whiter than the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.210
 snow but one month when I go my 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.970
 Galician land

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.390
 tricks but I also want to know if 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.460
