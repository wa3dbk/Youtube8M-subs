a<00:00:14.940> set<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.389> video<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.320> not<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> be

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
a set of video so it's not going to be

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
a set of video so it's not going to be
something<00:00:17.070> that's<00:00:17.220> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.970> one

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
something that's going to be just one

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.540 
something that's going to be just one
video<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.350> we'll<00:00:19.470> cover<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.279> would<00:00:20.430> be

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
video and we'll cover it all it would be

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.509 
video and we'll cover it all it would be
quite<00:00:20.730> gradual<00:00:21.180> small<00:00:21.600> short<00:00:22.020> videos<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> that

quite gradual small short videos so that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.400 
quite gradual small short videos so that
we<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.000> go<00:00:24.119> from<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.570> basics<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
we can go from the very basics to the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.160 
we can go from the very basics to the
advanced<00:00:26.279> much<00:00:26.699> later<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> moment

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
advanced much later on but at the moment

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
advanced much later on but at the moment
we<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> start<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> basics<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.519> that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we have to start the basics and that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
we have to start the basics and that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
will start with a base course skills

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.120

verbal pitch is made up of a grid of 12
sorry<00:02:19.900> 15<00:02:20.290> x<00:02:20.530> 24<00:02:21.340> squares<00:02:22.330> each<00:02:22.569> player<00:02:23.170> is

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
sorry 15 x 24 squares each player is

able to take up a single square this

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.699 
able to take up a single square this
means<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.549> move<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.940> deploy<00:02:28.239> your

means that you can move and deploy your

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.699 
means that you can move and deploy your
players<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:30.989> different<00:02:31.989> sort<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.200> formations

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
players in different sort of formations

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.520 
players in different sort of formations
and<00:02:33.329> generally<00:02:34.329> it<00:02:34.569> also<00:02:34.750> adds<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.319> game

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and generally it also adds to the game

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.110 
and generally it also adds to the game
and<00:02:35.709> it'll<00:02:35.860> become<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.430> little<00:02:36.760> bit<00:02:36.819> clearer

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
and it'll become a little bit clearer

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.399 
and it'll become a little bit clearer
but<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.450> main<00:02:37.599> thing<00:02:37.629> is<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.079> realize

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
but the main thing is that you realize

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.940 
but the main thing is that you realize
there<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:41.579> grid<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:44.109> game<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.500> blood<00:02:44.709> bowl

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
there is a grid the game of blood bowl

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.089 
there is a grid the game of blood bowl
requires<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.730> use<00:02:45.879> of<00:02:45.910> dice<00:02:47.040> basically<00:02:48.040> for

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
requires the use of dice basically for

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.940 
requires the use of dice basically for
any<00:02:48.370> action<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.819> isn't<00:02:49.269> just<00:02:49.480> moving<00:02:50.410> so

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
any action that isn't just moving so

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.819 
any action that isn't just moving so
dodging<00:02:52.019> etc<00:02:53.019> are<00:02:53.079> picking<00:02:53.319> up<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.500> ball<00:02:53.620> this

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
dodging etc are picking up the ball this

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.619 
dodging etc are picking up the ball this
is<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> block<00:02:54.340> which<00:02:54.790> requires<00:02:55.180> slightly

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
is a block which requires slightly

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.880 
is a block which requires slightly
different<00:02:55.959> dice<00:02:56.109> in<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.379> sense<00:02:56.560> they're<00:02:56.709> not

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
different dice in the sense they're not

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.940 
different dice in the sense they're not
labeled<00:02:57.099> 1<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.790> 6<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:59.440> dice<00:02:59.680> can

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
labeled 1 to 6 but the dice can

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.490 
labeled 1 to 6 but the dice can
correspond<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.519> different<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:01.480> face<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.409> on

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
correspond to different that face is on

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.059 
correspond to different that face is on
these<00:03:02.709> dice<00:03:03.569> correspond<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.140> number<00:03:05.590> so

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
these dice correspond to a number so

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.910 
these dice correspond to a number so
this<00:03:06.250> arrow<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.359> a<00:03:07.390> free<00:03:07.629> 24<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.379> 1<00:03:08.650> and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
this arrow is a free 24 this is a 1 and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.059 
this arrow is a free 24 this is a 1 and
this<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.190> 5<00:03:09.599> i'll<00:03:10.599> explain<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:10.989> in<00:03:11.379> another

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
this is a 5 i'll explain that in another

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.009 
this is a 5 i'll explain that in another
episode<00:03:12.400> when<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.790> do<00:03:12.879> blocking<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.870> that's

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
episode when I do blocking but that's

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.809 
episode when I do blocking but that's
all<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.200> need<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.560> know<00:03:14.680> about<00:03:14.709> blocking<00:03:15.519> guys

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
all you need to know about blocking guys

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.300 
all you need to know about blocking guys
for<00:03:16.030> now<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:18.269> just<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.510> blocks<00:03:19.930> if<00:03:20.799> you

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
for now and just like blocks if you

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.129 
for now and just like blocks if you
require<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.790> make<00:03:21.940> ball<00:03:22.150> plays<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.690> often

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
require to make ball plays it often

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.250 
require to make ball plays it often
takes<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.650> look<00:03:24.130> takes<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.849> number<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.870> dice<00:03:26.049> as

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
takes a look takes a number of dice as

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.259 
takes a look takes a number of dice as
well<00:03:26.410> for<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:27.459> example<00:03:27.519> here<00:03:27.879> I'm

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
well for that so for example here I'm

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.780 
well for that so for example here I'm
going<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.599> have<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.900> pick<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.410> on<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.620> 2<00:03:29.859> plus<00:03:30.280> so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
going to have to pick up on a 2 plus so

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.610 
going to have to pick up on a 2 plus so
dice<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.450> rolled<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.930> you<00:03:31.989> can<00:03:32.139> see<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> roles

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
dice is rolled and you can see the roles

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.890 
dice is rolled and you can see the roles
that<00:03:32.709> are<00:03:32.829> made<00:03:33.010> down<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.549> bottom<00:03:33.700> here<00:03:33.970> so

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
that are made down on the bottom here so

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.319 
that are made down on the bottom here so
well<00:03:35.049> first<00:03:35.230> we'll<00:03:35.440> try<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.769> pick<00:03:35.889> it<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.329> and

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
well first we'll try and pick it up and

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.819 
well first we'll try and pick it up and
he<00:03:37.510> does<00:03:37.660> pick<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.019> up<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.349> can<00:03:38.379> see<00:03:38.620> here

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
he does pick it up and you can see here

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.369 
he does pick it up and you can see here
it<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> agility<00:03:40.239> free<00:03:40.569> plus<00:03:40.810> but<00:03:41.049> because

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
it was a agility free plus but because

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.099 
it was a agility free plus but because
it's<00:03:41.530> applied<00:03:41.799> he<00:03:42.099> gets<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.669> modifier<00:03:43.540> plus<00:03:43.870> one

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
it's applied he gets a modifier plus one

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.460 
it's applied he gets a modifier plus one
for<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.349> pickup<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.730> I'll<00:03:46.510> explain<00:03:46.810> all<00:03:47.169> about

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
for a pickup but I'll explain all about

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.439 
for a pickup but I'll explain all about
how<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.859> work<00:03:48.220> these<00:03:48.430> out<00:03:48.639> individually<00:03:49.329> when

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
how you work these out individually when

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.509 
how you work these out individually when
we<00:03:49.599> discuss<00:03:49.989> these<00:03:50.199> skills<00:03:50.530> but<00:03:51.129> just<00:03:51.340> for

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
we discuss these skills but just for

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.189 
we discuss these skills but just for
example<00:03:51.609> here's<00:03:52.299> me<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.750> make<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.900> throw

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
example here's me going to make a throw

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.740 
example here's me going to make a throw
as<00:03:53.440> well<00:03:53.769> I'll<00:03:54.340> do<00:03:54.669> it<00:03:54.790> long<00:03:54.970> range<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.540> prove

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
as well I'll do it long range to prove

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.460 
as well I'll do it long range to prove
to<00:03:56.109> show<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.319> something<00:03:56.709> else<00:03:56.799> oh<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:59.410> gets

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
to show you something else oh it gets

rather me at this current point my turn
and<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:57.700> only<00:04:57.820> thing<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.240> can<00:04:58.390> happen<00:04:58.650> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
and the only thing that can happen and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.940 
and the only thing that can happen and
you<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.460> be<00:05:00.550> careful<00:05:00.700> is<00:05:01.710> turnovers<00:05:02.710> is

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
you have to be careful is turnovers is

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.060 
you have to be careful is turnovers is
where<00:05:03.790> your<00:05:03.940> turn<00:05:04.240> earns<00:05:04.540> their<00:05:05.290> their<00:05:05.620> turn

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
where your turn earns their their turn

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.720 
where your turn earns their their turn
ends<00:05:06.610> prematurely<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.710> failed<00:05:09.040> an<00:05:09.340> action

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
ends prematurely so you failed an action

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.410 
ends prematurely so you failed an action
which<00:05:09.880> basically<00:05:10.810> causes<00:05:11.590> your<00:05:11.830> turn<00:05:12.100> to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
which basically causes your turn to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.220 
which basically causes your turn to
screw<00:05:13.420> up<00:05:13.480> or<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:14.550> not<00:05:15.840> succeed<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.110> will

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
screw up or and not succeed and you will

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.350 
screw up or and not succeed and you will
suffer<00:05:17.710> there<00:05:17.920> for<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.190> consequences<00:05:18.550> which

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
suffer there for the consequences which

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.830 
suffer there for the consequences which
is<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.570> bad<00:05:20.550> which<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:22.180> end<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.480> your<00:05:22.600> turn

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
is a bad which is the end of your turn

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.000 
is a bad which is the end of your turn
when<00:05:23.320> you<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:23.740> don't<00:05:23.920> want<00:05:24.100> it<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:26.470> let's

need<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.400> do<00:05:30.580> is<00:05:32.250> well<00:05:33.250> there's<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.430> number<00:05:33.580> of

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
need to do is well there's a number of

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.640 
need to do is well there's a number of
ways<00:05:33.760> you<00:05:33.880> can<00:05:34.120> concede<00:05:34.540> a<00:05:34.630> turnover<00:05:35.080> one<00:05:35.530> is

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
ways you can concede a turnover one is

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.770 
ways you can concede a turnover one is
by<00:05:35.800> failing<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.310> simple<00:05:36.640> action<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:37.600> for

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
by failing a simple action so for

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.400 
by failing a simple action so for
example<00:05:37.870> here<00:05:38.230> if<00:05:38.800> I'd<00:05:39.040> failed<00:05:39.280> that<00:05:39.520> dodge

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
example here if I'd failed that dodge

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.130 
example here if I'd failed that dodge
another<00:05:41.410> is<00:05:41.650> by<00:05:41.800> failing<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.340> block<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:43.140> here

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
another is by failing a block and here

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.990 
another is by failing a block and here
we'll<00:05:44.290> try<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:44.680> go<00:05:44.860> uphill<00:05:45.130> block<00:05:45.670> against

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
we'll try and go uphill block against

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.420 
we'll try and go uphill block against
this<00:05:46.210> guy<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:47.110> see<00:05:47.290> what<00:05:47.440> he<00:05:47.530> can<00:05:47.650> do<00:05:52.830> right<00:05:53.830> so

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
this guy and see what he can do right so

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.750 
this guy and see what he can do right so
this<00:05:54.940> would<00:05:55.150> be<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.270> turnover<00:05:55.980> as<00:05:56.980> I've<00:05:57.250> are<00:05:57.550> not

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
this would be a turnover as I've are not

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.610 
this would be a turnover as I've are not

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
should be quite that covers I think the

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.430 
should be quite that covers I think the
simplest<00:07:16.000> part<00:07:16.420> of<00:07:16.630> blood<00:07:16.930> bowl<00:07:17.110> that's<00:07:17.290> the

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 
simplest part of blood bowl that's the

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.100 
simplest part of blood bowl that's the
very<00:07:17.620> basic<00:07:18.370> introduction<00:07:18.910> I'll<00:07:19.240> cover<00:07:19.720> more

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
very basic introduction I'll cover more

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.630 
very basic introduction I'll cover more
on<00:07:20.320> my<00:07:20.470> next<00:07:20.770> episode<00:07:21.190> which<00:07:22.090> is<00:07:22.390> likely<00:07:22.720> to<00:07:22.930> be

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:23.640 
on my next episode which is likely to be

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.630 
on my next episode which is likely to be
discussing<00:07:24.640> drives<00:07:25.470> I<00:07:26.470> think<00:07:27.340> that's<00:07:27.490> the

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:27.640 
discussing drives I think that's the

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.060 
discussing drives I think that's the
best<00:07:27.790> thing<00:07:28.060> to<00:07:28.210> do<00:07:28.390> so<00:07:29.050> discuss<00:07:29.500> the<00:07:29.680> format

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
best thing to do so discuss the format

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.220 
best thing to do so discuss the format
of<00:07:30.100> the<00:07:30.250> blood<00:07:30.460> bowl<00:07:30.669> game<00:07:30.940> and<00:07:31.270> the<00:07:31.810> pattern

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430 
the game is to score touchdowns which

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.630 
the game is to score touchdowns which
are<00:07:46.080> very<00:07:47.080> simply<00:07:47.530> that<00:07:47.680> you<00:07:47.740> get<00:07:48.130> the<00:07:48.250> ball<00:07:48.430> to
