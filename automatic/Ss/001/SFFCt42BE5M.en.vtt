00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.320
 Hello guys 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.640
 This video is a response to an issue we sent to our session 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.129
 take your doubts 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.480
 the student asked 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.239
 on the show today at the event 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.870
 what makes a davis animation is exploded 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.240
 and did not create little does 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.100
 another in genes may make sense is possible 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.060
 How does this process work? 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.470
 it explains how this process does not use this set that is a 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.649
 their 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:29.919
 and let's blow 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.919
 This tap to see 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.390
 first we have to create 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 some krishna that shocks 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.409
 as if they were photographs 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.850
 for we are stronger then 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.110
 Let's create here an excerpt of luck the world that is ours 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.750
 ah 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.720
 commented 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.930
 mounted 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 the following people will see the movie begins to move 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600
 these pecs carr 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.580
 Let's see it good first. 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.920
 Become a Friend 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.050
 bring you here 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.400
 Let's get defeated before moving the next one. Let's create 1 second in the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.210
 shorts 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.670
 then we'll pick the ones here from fig lagen dobri fire at soap operas so in 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.780
 low 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.690
 then it would be interesting if we take the ccp in the lateral team 'jumped 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.420
 only this 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.830
 Pinochet, if we look at the door 15 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.280
 we'll see that there is not a square here on the kimi table side 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.560
 does not have a box next to it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.600
 his name 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.930
 this means that this inconsequential form 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.820
 so that we may have 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.619
 the rum diary or move u 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.700
 the teacher is required to have some degree 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.280
 freedom of movement 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.800
 so we have to disable stole a note from the assembly constants of the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.429
 pin 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.259
 he can move 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.259
 the goal is to give an edit set together 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:16.909
 and we see that it ends at 7 here that was ninth of the pin in the hole 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.750
 to immolate oneself 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.210
 keita lining up 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.740
 the phase of the modesty cult of the pin rafa its channel 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.449
 Dakar 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.469
 get this al-ain informed or delete I will give an example 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.659
 anyone who leaves as told 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.199
 OK 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.039
 we'll be right back 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.039
 by our blood 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.689
 senile prodigy 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.979
 we came back here in brazil and now we pull the quinzinho 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.209
 the pilot is out 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.419
 in nets the title this position also 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:03.059
 and let's get the spine here oh the screw and we'll pull it out here too 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.659
 so we have here 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:09.749
 the explosion 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.219
 our 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.600
 d 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.250
 other artifacts 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.180
 we will not touch the other pieces here or it will complicate our ceiling a bit 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.149
 the tutorial 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.699
 we are showing basic how to do this what is this 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.629
 click ok with chile 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.769
 Let's stop the end. 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.979
 Cheer up in flames 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:35.409
 Let's go, I want to put that initial kick-off and the scenes almost the same access 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.039
 we'll be 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.480
 and let's create a difficult sequence 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.329
 3 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.399
 because they are the sequences of the swans or the ones that we created 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.249
 for that we come here in charge kylie 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.869
 here we suffer centuries air 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.869
 so soon we will define that in time the 0 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.159
 at 0 seconds 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.189
 is isner xote 1 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.919
 o hawks 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.989
 the current nets t2 we will put it to two seconds at the beginning 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.639
 strong nets 3 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.639
 We're going to start four seconds from the start. 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.679
 isner xote 4 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.150
 to six seconds 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
 and we will release prisoners on these 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 to eight seconds 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.090
 let's define that the movements will be smooth 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.960
 And we'll give you what? 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.699
 Let's continue to see how it is. 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.050
 aa to our animation in the common command 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
 amazing as highlights 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.729
 it hurt 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.359
 choked and in the beginning but now it goes a little bit more but change 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.180
 let's go 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.419
 created the video itself now 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.759
 what is with the 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 Kleber 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.080
 he played jumping the interferences that have not in the air without dullness 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.080
 those ten seconds 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.069
 ending the interference calculation will open the window in 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.180
 mind 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.550
 when can we 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.449
 visualize again 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.350
 Ah know yourself 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.099
 of animation 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.400
 We jumped on the lot nets 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.629
 at the end for rifle pin if there is the same time but okay 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.430
 instigate loop and let's use what I have 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.830
 let's define our rss feed 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.770
 will be done in avi format 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.250
 window size 640 by 314 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.339
 we will not fulfill it we create 25 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.619
 It's a little long, but then any editors and 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.010
 You can do some treatment on this video. 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.010
 And we can give you an okay 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.849
 children's allowance will suffice, we will go to the 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:21.059
 where we wanted the 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.189
 I arrived here in Tokyo 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:27.819
 sahin 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.189
 clos 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.189
 and we'll open in the U-20 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.349
 then that's it 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:44.580
 is an example of the zico tab we did not go into many details that was precisely the 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.139
 proposal of our rise doubts 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.610
 not a complete course on 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.939
 the questions asked 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:55.360
 indicates the path 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.669
 which should be taken 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.969
 to solve the doubts that await us 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:00.199
 OK 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.069
 until the next step
