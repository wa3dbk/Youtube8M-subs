00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.540
 you can not explain that and straight 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.530
 another such player 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.230
 national team is that I believe 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.180
 sometimes happens against sweden but 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.200
 The words that were missing today would have been missing 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 we take a giant step forward 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.500
 can make and also halftime 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.510
 played in the first half 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.390
 that was that was the true face of 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.220
 Prussia 2000 was no more 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.870
 I think it's not important now 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.150
 somehow if any players 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.190
 or anyone guilty of chalking up 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.500
 that we are all to blame for that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.400
 did not win here today and 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 It is important that we do not have now 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.660
 have to move closer together and yes you 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.090
 that's just how you see it until the last one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.140
 minute and that's all there 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.040
 can still happen but as I said 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 important is that we now 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.270
 We do not have to stick together 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 Eat each other 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 as a coach, I can try now 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 Saying each other nice to talk but im 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.379
 We only took the grounds 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.869
 played undecided and that makes 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.580
 actually many things are bad and that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.550
 is sadder because the team 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.680
 has invested a lot we have that too 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.850
 what we have planned to do that well 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.560
 have implemented 30 guided and then 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.190
 just then we had to be very consistent 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.350
 stay and also the ball bit 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.970
 longer but we do not have that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.649
 managed and there must be the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.660
 team only reproach that 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.490
 we did not make it after 30 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.490
 to get control over the game and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.929
 on the contrary the game was open 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 absolutely unnecessary for me and that is 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.220
 annoying but of course we wanted 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.660
 after the game last week wanted 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.940
 Of course here are three points around 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.310
 our home win our home player 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.209
 to make positive 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.679
 we do not need the table 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.700
 we have to look up much more 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.840
 see ourselves and must first 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.399
 Watching us from week to week 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.660
 retracting our points is then playing 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.090
 no matter what everyone else is doing 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.580
 we have one hand but as well 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.319
 we need to ask ourselves right now 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.759
 Do not worry, we have yes 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.130
 already said that we want that and in 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.690
 the starting point now is that we 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.369
 because of the above can speak 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.630
 We also do not want that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.730
 do not worry or worry about it 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.459
 to take that word in your mouth 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.220
 only if it counted at the end of also of 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.840
 ascend if it is in the end but then 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.550
 the points should have been 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.940
 Maybe you will see that in the end 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.940
 of the day
