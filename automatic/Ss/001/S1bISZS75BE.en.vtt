00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
all right and here we have it all set up

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.710 
all right and here we have it all set up
I<00:04:46.370> think<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.490> got<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.940> best<00:04:48.210> there<00:04:48.540> were<00:04:48.690> a

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
I think I got it the best there were a

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.629 
I think I got it the best there were a
few<00:04:49.020> extra<00:04:49.169> pieces<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.100> I'm<00:04:50.190> thinking<00:04:50.550> they

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
few extra pieces so I'm thinking they

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.490 
few extra pieces so I'm thinking they
were<00:04:50.729> just<00:04:50.850> extra<00:04:51.570> in<00:04:51.660> case<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.930> lost<00:04:52.139> em

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
were just extra in case you lost em

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.490 
were just extra in case you lost em
otherwise<00:04:52.770> cuz<00:04:53.729> I<00:04:53.820> followed<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.210> directions

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
otherwise cuz I followed the directions

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.050 
otherwise cuz I followed the directions
pretty<00:04:55.500> closely<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:58.610> looks<00:04:59.610> pretty<00:04:59.880> much<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
pretty closely so looks pretty much the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.690 
pretty closely so looks pretty much the
same<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.660> me<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:01.169> couldn't<00:05:01.950> get<00:05:02.070> mine<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.370> sit<00:05:02.580> up

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
same to me I couldn't get mine to sit up

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.000 
same to me I couldn't get mine to sit up
quite<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.120> well<00:05:03.300> as<00:05:03.360> in<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.810> picture<00:05:04.680> though

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
quite as well as in the picture though

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.300
