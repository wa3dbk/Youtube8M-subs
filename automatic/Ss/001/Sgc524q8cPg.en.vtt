there's the back half of the mold and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
there's the back half of the mold and
there's<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.430> casting<00:00:39.090> pulled<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there's the first casting pulled out of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's the first casting pulled out of
the<00:00:39.809> mold<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.910> that's<00:00:41.910> made<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.150> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the mold and that's made out of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.869 
the mold and that's made out of
fiberglass<00:00:43.100> with<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> resin<00:00:44.580> interior<00:00:45.150> and

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
fiberglass with a resin interior and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.569 
fiberglass with a resin interior and
came<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.150> nice<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.840> filed<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> bents

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
came out pretty nice I filed the bents

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.080 
came out pretty nice I filed the bents
out<00:00:50.780> cut<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:54.000> section<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:56.090> very

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
out cut the this section out very

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.540 
out cut the this section out very
minimal<00:00:57.600> seam<00:00:57.899> line<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.739> basically

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
minimal seam line this is basically

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.980 
minimal seam line this is basically
ready<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> paint<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.890> I've<00:01:04.890> got<00:01:05.390> maybe<00:01:06.390> like

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
ready to paint and I've got maybe like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.370 
ready to paint and I've got maybe like
an<00:01:07.140> hour<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:08.550> work<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.910> cleanup<00:01:09.360> work<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> most

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
an hour to work of cleanup work and most

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.210 
an hour to work of cleanup work and most
of<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> time<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.210> was<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:13.190> cutting<00:01:14.190> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
of that time was was me cutting the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.570 
of that time was was me cutting the
vents<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.789> and<00:01:15.110> filing<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.580> getting

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
vents out and filing them and getting

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.999 
vents out and filing them and getting
them<00:01:17.640> even<00:01:18.030> looking<00:01:19.640> probably<00:01:20.640> spent<00:01:21.030> about

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
them even looking probably spent about

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.290 
them even looking probably spent about
counting<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> vents<00:01:23.490> file<00:01:23.789> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> vent

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
counting the vents file in the vent

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.800 
counting the vents file in the vent
towel<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.929> lens<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.190> mouth<00:01:26.429> part

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
towel and lens in the mouth part

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.419 
towel and lens in the mouth part
probably<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.410> took<00:01:28.590> me<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.890> least<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.220> good

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
probably that took me at least a good

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.020 
probably that took me at least a good
half<00:01:29.640> hour<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:31.229> rest<00:01:31.440> of<00:01:31.649> it<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:31.920> just

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
half hour and the rest of it was just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.059 
half hour and the rest of it was just
minor<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.539> tiny<00:01:33.810> bumps<00:01:34.289> on<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.619> surface

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
minor little tiny bumps on the surface

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.400 
minor little tiny bumps on the surface
from<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.420> mold<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:37.200> kind

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
from you know because the mold some kind

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.510 
from you know because the mold some kind
of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> mold<00:01:37.890> had<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> little

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of the mold had like a little

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.120 
of the mold had like a little
imperfections<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.599> the<00:01:39.660> in<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.440> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
imperfections in the in it which you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.609 
imperfections in the in it which you
know<00:01:41.250> affects<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.330> surface<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.020> nothing

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
know affects the surface but nothing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.839 
know affects the surface but nothing
major<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:45.690> there's<00:01:45.929> a<00:01:46.020> finished<00:01:46.440> one<00:01:46.679> well<00:01:47.640> not

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
major so there's a finished one well not

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.120 
major so there's a finished one well not
a<00:01:47.880> finished<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.569> a<00:01:48.599> casting<00:01:49.200> because

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a finished one but a casting because

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
a finished one but a casting because
there's<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.550> back<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.000> mold<00:01:51.679> front<00:01:52.679> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there's the back of the mold front of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.070 
there's the back of the mold front of
the<00:01:52.830> mold<00:01:53.039> those<00:01:53.340> two<00:01:53.520> halves<00:01:53.789> go<00:01:54.060> together<00:01:54.209> as

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
the mold those two halves go together as

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.839 
the mold those two halves go together as
you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.679> it's<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.190> little<00:01:56.280> key<00:01:56.610> ways

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
you can see it's got the little key ways

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.469 
you can see it's got the little key ways
so<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.569> nubs<00:01:57.929> fit<00:01:58.349> into<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> holes<00:01:59.479> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so the little nubs fit into the holes so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.529 
so the little nubs fit into the holes so
it<00:02:00.509> always<00:02:00.720> fits<00:02:00.989> the<00:02:01.259> same<00:02:01.470> way<00:02:01.739> and<00:02:02.539> there's

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
it always fits the same way and there's

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.130 
it always fits the same way and there's
the<00:02:03.630> original<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:05.209> so<00:02:06.209> I'll<00:02:06.569> pack<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.080> up

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the original one so I'll pack that up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.300 
the original one so I'll pack that up
and<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.640> away<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.270> now<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.470> make<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> few

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and put it away and now I can make a few

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.280 
and put it away and now I can make a few
helmets<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.000> paint<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.540> different<00:02:12.959> schemes

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
helmets to paint in different schemes

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.309 
helmets to paint in different schemes
and<00:02:13.620> i'll<00:02:14.010> post<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.640> videos<00:02:15.569> or<00:02:15.780> pictures<00:02:15.989> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and i'll post the videos or pictures of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.300 
and i'll post the videos or pictures of
that<00:02:16.819> when<00:02:17.819> i<00:02:17.849> start<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.630> work<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:19.050> one
