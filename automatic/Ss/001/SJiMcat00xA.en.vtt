00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 and 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 1 2 3 and 4 5 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:47.100
 and 6 and 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 1 2 3 and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.520
 Latin American windows common 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.550
 we have the feet slightly outwards 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.310
 turned that is a light v 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.310
 in addition, the weight about the football 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.240
 that means forward and when we go 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.130
 still slightly on his knees 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.460
 I would bet better with that today 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.350
 okay for the gentleman it starts 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.420
 with the left foot I'll stay for a while 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.750
 turned side so that you can see better 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.850
 can 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.420
 The first step is a small one 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:21.150
 step back behind the other foot 1 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 if with the left little back though 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 the weight you see remains over 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760
 the front foot I'm not going here 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.850
 to the rear 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.630
 ok 12 is the right foot on the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.380
 place 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 2 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:46.140
 the whole thing from the back 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 We start with 1 2 then 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.960
 it continues with a sideways up 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:58.280
 close the left side with time since 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 from speed 3 and 4 3 and 4 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 then we take the foot very easily 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 zoom make 5 and 6 again to step 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.849
 back in the other direction 5 and 6 ok 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.260
 steps to the side, please put down there 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.110
 the dance is pretty fast otherwise 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:24.750
 come up yet with the music afterwards 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:29.010
 times counted throughout the 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.019
 6 that's just the same for the lady 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.160
 mirrored that means the lady catches 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.540
 with the right foot on 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.930
 one step back then one 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 on the spot two on the spot 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:47.190
 3 and 4 goes in the direction 3 close 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.709
 4 football in 5 and 6 back in 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:02.190
 Close the other direction 5 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:09.720
 6 that is 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 and 1 2 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:16.910
 3 and 4 5 and 6 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:19.230
 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.579
 lead the land we have no 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.200
 That's why we go to the place 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.230
 more precise on the attitude 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 The lady puts her right hand in mine 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.549
 left hand if we hold hands lightly 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.700
 caught and have here on the whole 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.170
 a loose altitude where it is pleasant 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.450
 With my right hand I grab that 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.190
 scapula of the lady and the lady 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.829
 is yes, the left hand on my 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.090
 shoulder that is the basic attitude of 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.769
 hands as well as we have the weight 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.180
 on the ball of the foot that is it looks like that 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.340
 a bit as if to one another 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.769
 fall and go slightly in the knee 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.549
 This distance was at the bottom of the ship 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.079
 the same 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.060
 that means we have this here 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:02.850
 basic step and 1 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.910
 you can see we are not going here 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.139
 back on the back but sets 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.139
 only the foot to the rear
