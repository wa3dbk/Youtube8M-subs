actually had been looking at the upload

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.440 
actually had been looking at the upload
speeds<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.410> 15<00:03:45.100> minute<00:03:45.459> video<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:47.590> about

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
to upload to YouTube I think that's

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.650 
to upload to YouTube I think that's
pretty<00:03:59.380> slow<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:01.170> after<00:04:02.170> my<00:04:02.500> internets<00:04:03.040> being

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
pretty slow and after my internets being

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.420 
pretty slow and after my internets being
double<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.870> hope<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.560> these<00:04:05.739> numbers<00:04:06.250> will

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
double I hope that these numbers will

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.840 
double I hope that these numbers will
double<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:06.910> well<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.900> anyway<00:04:08.350> it's<00:04:09.160> enough<00:04:09.670> of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850
