for<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:55.109> personally<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:56.870> step<00:00:57.870> back<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
for me personally to step back and to

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:01.520 
for me personally to step back and to
put<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> helmet<00:00:59.819> on<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.030> side<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.350> look

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
put the helmet on the side and to look

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.690 
put the helmet on the side and to look
at<00:01:01.679> other<00:01:01.800> opportunities<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.059> came<00:01:03.839> up

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
at other opportunities that have came up

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.039 
at other opportunities that have came up
because<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> racing<00:01:06.420> driver<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.810> think

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because there's a racing driver I think

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.190 
because there's a racing driver I think
it's<00:01:07.200> important<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.219> know<00:01:08.369> when<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.969> go<00:01:09.960> places

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
it's important to know when to go places

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.319 
it's important to know when to go places
and<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.680> things<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.159> decisions<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.149> make<00:01:12.270> but

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
and do things and decisions to make but

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.630 
and do things and decisions to make but
it's<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:13.140> important<00:01:13.829> to<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:14.399> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it's also very important to know when to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's also very important to know when to
stop<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> I've<00:01:17.670> always<00:01:17.880> said

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.499 
just like I did quite a few years ago as
well<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:02.130> need<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.609> get<00:02:02.969> their<00:02:03.179> seek

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
well and they need to get their seek

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.569 
well and they need to get their seek
time<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.020> show<00:02:04.289> what<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.679> can<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.219> I'm

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
time to show what they can do and I'm

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.010 
time to show what they can do and I'm
looking<00:02:05.880> forward<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.179> being<00:02:06.359> part<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.719> audi

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
looking forward to being part of audi

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
looking forward to being part of audi
sport<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.859> the<00:02:07.979> future<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.819> ensure<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
sport and in the future to ensure that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.240 
sport and in the future to ensure that
these<00:02:09.569> guys<00:02:09.840> also<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.590> same<00:02:10.800> level<00:02:11.159> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
these guys also have the same level of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
these guys also have the same level of
fun<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.879> success<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.510> I've<00:02:12.930> enjoyed<00:02:13.440> over

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
fun and success that I've enjoyed over

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.280 
fun and success that I've enjoyed over
the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.690 
the
years<00:02:14.439> there's<00:02:15.159> many<00:02:15.480> reasons<00:02:16.980> why<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.400> think

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
years there's many reasons why I think

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.899 
years there's many reasons why I think
drivers<00:02:19.299> decide<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.530> they<00:02:20.650> want<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.099> step

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
drivers decide that they want to step

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.599 
drivers decide that they want to step
back<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> little<00:02:22.329> bit<00:02:22.689> and<00:02:23.250> certainly<00:02:24.250> from<00:02:24.400> my

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
back a little bit and certainly from my

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.099 
back a little bit and certainly from my
point<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:25.060> view<00:02:25.859> it's<00:02:26.859> very<00:02:27.010> clearly<00:02:28.109> stated

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
point of view it's very clearly stated

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.140 
point of view it's very clearly stated
many<00:02:29.290> occasions<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.189> would<00:02:30.609> want<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.939> go<00:02:31.060> out

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
many occasions I would want to go out

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.339 
many occasions I would want to go out
when<00:02:31.420> I'm<00:02:31.569> still<00:02:31.810> at<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.989> top<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.970> there's

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
when I'm still at the top and there's

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.750 
when I'm still at the top and there's
just<00:02:35.349> simple<00:02:35.739> facts<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.129> life<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.640> know

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
just simple facts of life you know

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.809 
just simple facts of life you know
getting<00:02:37.599> on<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.959> years<00:02:37.989> from<00:02:38.290> 44<00:02:38.890> at<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.670> end

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
getting on in years from 44 at the end

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.250 
getting on in years from 44 at the end
of<00:02:40.260> 2013<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.849> still<00:02:43.060> perform<00:02:43.299> but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
of 2013 and you can still perform but

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.420 
of 2013 and you can still perform but
ultimately<00:02:45.359> I've<00:02:46.359> always<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.260> only<00:02:47.739> been

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
ultimately I've always and only been

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.949 
ultimately I've always and only been
involved<00:02:48.909> in<00:02:49.000> racing<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.569> win<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.889> win<00:02:50.920> is

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
involved in racing to win and to win is

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.679 
involved in racing to win and to win is
the<00:02:52.959> reason<00:02:53.319> we<00:02:53.560> do<00:02:53.739> go<00:02:53.919> racing<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.689> so

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
the reason we do go racing and so

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.280 
the reason we do go racing and so
therefore<00:02:55.930> i<00:02:56.829> think<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.139> investment<00:02:59.139> of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
therefore i think the the investment of

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.890 
therefore i think the the investment of
time<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.769> investment<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.459> energy<00:03:00.579> in<00:03:01.299> mental

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
time the investment of energy in mental

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.860 
time the investment of energy in mental
and<00:03:02.049> physical<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:03.250> well<00:03:03.280> as<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:04.150> sacrifices

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
and physical as well as the sacrifices

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.429 
and physical as well as the sacrifices
for<00:03:05.049> family<00:03:05.379> as<00:03:05.500> well<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:07.540> I've<00:03:07.959> had<00:03:08.169> a

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
for family as well and now I've had a

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.610 
for family as well and now I've had a
long<00:03:09.010> long<00:03:09.519> career<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.540> one<00:03:10.720> that's<00:03:10.900> hell<00:03:11.349> did

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
long long career and one that's hell did

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.679
