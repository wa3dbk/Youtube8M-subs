you don't have that harmonica in your
face<00:01:56.650> constantly<00:01:58.690> it's<00:01:59.690> gonna<00:01:59.840> stymie<00:02:00.850> your

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
face constantly it's gonna stymie your

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.330 
face constantly it's gonna stymie your
development<00:02:02.450> as<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:03.020> musician<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:05.479> know<00:02:05.510> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
development as a musician you know and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.040 
development as a musician you know and
with<00:02:08.149> things<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.509> third<00:02:08.750> position<00:02:09.259> at<00:02:09.440> first

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
with things like third position at first

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.550 
with things like third position at first
and<00:02:12.050> cross<00:02:12.860> even<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.520> know<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.560> it's

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and cross even you know it's it's it's

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.860 
and cross even you know it's it's it's
just<00:02:15.830> repetition<00:02:16.160> certain<00:02:17.030> techniques<00:02:17.510> that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
just repetition certain techniques that

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.640 
just repetition certain techniques that
you<00:02:18.020> know<00:02:19.330> techniques<00:02:20.330> don't<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.410> shouldn't

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
you know techniques don't you shouldn't

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.550 
you know techniques don't you shouldn't
ever<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:22.300> experimenting<00:02:23.300> as<00:02:24.230> far<00:02:24.470> as

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
ever be experimenting as far as

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.460 
ever be experimenting as far as
technique<00:02:25.010> goes<00:02:25.040> really<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> bandstand

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
technique goes really on the bandstand

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.710 
technique goes really on the bandstand
technique<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:28.010> something<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.940> should<00:02:29.690> be

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
technique is is something that should be

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.970 
technique is is something that should be
like<00:02:29.959> breathing<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.740> only<00:02:30.860> way

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
like breathing to you and the only way

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
like breathing to you and the only way
to<00:02:31.040> do<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.420> know<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.570> might

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
to do that is you know you might

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.210 
to do that is you know you might
rear-end<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.230> few<00:02:33.410> people<00:02:33.740> because<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:34.070> always

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
rear-end a few people because I always

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.460 
rear-end a few people because I always
had<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.760> car<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.840> know

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
had to do it in the car but you know

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.160 
had to do it in the car but you know
that<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.400> warble<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.150> thing<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.810> that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that that warble that thing that that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.500 
that that warble that thing that that
the<00:02:39.530> back-and-forth<00:02:40.160> thing<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.610> know<00:02:49.510> that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
the back-and-forth thing you know that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.229 
the back-and-forth thing you know that
is<00:02:51.320> something<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.770> just<00:02:51.890> takes<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.700> couldn't

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
is something that just takes I couldn't

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.630 
is something that just takes I couldn't
do<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.660> longest<00:02:53.900> time<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.650> for<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
do that for the longest time and for the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.979 
do that for the longest time and for the
student<00:02:55.940> we're<00:02:56.030> talking<00:02:56.300> about<00:02:56.390> tongues<00:02:56.810> on

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
student we're talking about tongues on

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.210 
student we're talking about tongues on
the<00:02:57.050> harmonic<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.590> moving<00:02:57.890> left<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.160> right

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
the harmonic it's moving left to right

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.040 
the harmonic it's moving left to right
right<00:02:58.550> when<00:02:59.150> you're<00:02:59.270> doing<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.600> does<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.840> tip

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
right when you're doing it does the tip

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.420 
right when you're doing it does the tip
move<00:03:00.230> left<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.470> right<00:03:00.650> or<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.890> keep<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.250> tip

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
move left to right or you keep the tip

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.680 
move left to right or you keep the tip
centered<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.940> you're<00:03:02.030> kind<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.300> moving<00:03:02.570> the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
centered and you're kind of moving the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
centered and you're kind of moving the
middle<00:03:03.230> body<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.709> top<00:03:03.890> uh<00:03:04.690> feel<00:03:05.690> free<00:03:05.720> to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
middle body of the top uh feel free to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.650 
middle body of the top uh feel free to
one<00:03:07.040> way<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.250> do<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.700> decode<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.209> that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
one way to do it and decode it that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.430 
one way to do it and decode it that
what's<00:03:08.870> my<00:03:09.020> job<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:11.600> nothing's<00:03:11.989> moving

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
what's my job so nothing's moving

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
used to be able to do it real fast with

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.580 
used to be able to do it real fast with
digits<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:52.880> know<00:03:53.110> but<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.260> whole<00:03:54.290> thing

digits that you know but the whole thing

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.140 
digits that you know but the whole thing
is<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.860> give<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.100> percussion<00:03:55.610> going<00:03:55.910> at<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
is to give that percussion going at the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.410 
is to give that percussion going at the
same<00:03:56.329> time<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.560> tongues<00:03:57.799> coming<00:03:58.250> off<00:03:58.459> kind

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
same time as the tongues coming off kind

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.350 
same time as the tongues coming off kind
of<00:03:59.540> in<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.750> same<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> same<00:04:01.640> rhythm<00:04:01.970> that

of in the same in the same rhythm that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.289 
of in the same in the same rhythm that
the<00:04:02.510> time<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.780> coming<00:04:02.959> off<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:05.060> know<00:04:05.180> of

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
the time is coming off and you know of
