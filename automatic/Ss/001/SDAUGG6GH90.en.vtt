00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.020
 first of all what brings people into a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.400
 plastic surgery cabinet 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.430
 on the nose is often 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.230
 defects these defects are badly experienced at 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.869
 right or wrong regardless of the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.699
 main thing is that we do not sell judge 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.830
 people are the people who live it 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.910
 themselves the fact of being bad in his 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.410
 skin and artwork is a problem 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.660
 strictly personal it is true that 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.550
 sometimes you have requests that are 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.010
 exaggerated it's up to the surgeon becomes the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.930
 reframe to explain myself but often the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.879
 motivations are real intentions 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.530
 I had since I was 12 years old 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.530
 have a small operation I had one and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.390
 right happened at that age there pretty much 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.770
 I started having a bump and I 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.480
 always had some small problems 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.910
 to breathe I never really 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.220
 breathe with the nose so I came 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.930
 see sir I then read the already 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.910
 can breathe a little bit better but 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 especially to eliminate this post is 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.320
 already imperfections that I had who have 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.230
 posed worry to the shoulder rhinoplasty 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.659
 is an intervention that allows 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.430
 change the appearance of the nose well 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.409
 sure the goal is to correct the flaws 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.150
 of the nose in this way it is a 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.190
 intervention among the interventions the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.890
 more difficult to the aesthetic world 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.870
 will say to the extent that these 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.610
 difficulties are not explained or three 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.470
 criteria that to me are very 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.369
 important the first is that your 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.159
 nose and unique 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.440
 there is no reason they are alike 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.330
 this physical peculiarity must be 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.950
 respected because in fact she you 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 belongs and you must not change it 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.390
 in clear when doing a rhinoplasty 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.979
 we have to improve while modifying but 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.280
 without changing the second difficulty 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.570
 it is to be in agreement with what 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.070
 the surgeon because he is certain 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.640
 that when one gets operated on by the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.799
 surgeon 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.860
 it's undeniable that you're going to have 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.440
 a part of his own criteria that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 will fit into your life 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.680
 the best way for that is to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
 show a little bit through a press 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.230
 book photos of people who have been 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.700
 operated before and after like that it allows 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.310
 to patients already to make themselves a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.100
 opinion about quality and especially about 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.630
 philosophy that goes that will preside over everything 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.010
 throughout this intervention is the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.190
 third difficulty the fingers your 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.470
 techniques as far as we have 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 an element that the surgeon does dominate 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.350
 not at all it's the skin it's a 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.120
 crucial element 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.410
 it is very important for the surgeon 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 he you understand that the experience 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.870
 plays its full to appreciate and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.090
 gauge this sort of skin 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.570
 will be the guardian of a good 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.010
 result 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.890
 the most trained requests on those 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.310
 Humpback that's for sure it's 90% of 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.040
 requests 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.330
 it's not all that after he can you 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.410
 can have a is deviated which are 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.430
 by the way among the most 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.380
 difficult to succeed 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.710
 you can also have problems at 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.070
 level of the tip a booster of one and 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.020
 maybe wide maybe and was beating 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.790
 maybe falls to plunging hangzhou 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.930
 is the result of both fact that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.380
 often people complain about having a 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.580
 nose too long 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.780
 that's why we call this 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.739
 operation elsewhere in a in 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.020
 plastic fixed on my bed at age 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.520
 of all ages had had an accident 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.580
 are also broken nose and I you 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.790
 find out about it and it always has me 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.680
 complexed and so I decided to 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.680
 consider improving my best
