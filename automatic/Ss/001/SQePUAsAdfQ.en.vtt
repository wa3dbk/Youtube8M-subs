00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
say it's not a case but it really kind

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.029 
say it's not a case but it really kind
of<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.240> couple<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.750> reasons<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.949> of

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
of is for a couple of reasons first of

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.050 
of is for a couple of reasons first of
all<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.369> much<00:00:29.490> better<00:00:29.699> than<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> other

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all this is much better than the other

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.609 
all this is much better than the other
case<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.510> aspect<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:31.019> much<00:00:31.170> easier<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
case in one aspect it's much easier to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.520 
case in one aspect it's much easier to
get<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> phone<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.120> probably<00:00:33.989> even<00:00:34.290> do

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
get the phone into it I probably even do

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650 
get the phone into it I probably even do
it<00:00:34.649> one-handed<00:00:35.010> keep<00:00:35.820> saying<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it one-handed keep saying that and I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.420 
it one-handed keep saying that and I
keep<00:00:36.840> failing<00:00:37.079> at<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.370> time

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
keep failing at it but I think this time

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
keep failing at it but I think this time
look<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.989> actually<00:00:40.200> did<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
look at that I actually did it and it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.299 
look at that I actually did it and it
didn't<00:00:41.399> fail<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.820> awesome<00:00:42.180> ok<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.350> I'll

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
didn't fail that's awesome ok so I'll

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
didn't fail that's awesome ok so I'll
turn<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> screen<00:00:44.760> off<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> put<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
turn the screen off here when you put it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.080 
turn the screen off here when you put it
on<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.469> look<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> few<00:00:47.280> things<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.969> i'm

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
on I look for a few things when i'm

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
on I look for a few things when i'm
looking<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.570> cases<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:49.110> look<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> lip

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
looking at cases i look for a lip

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
looking at cases i look for a lip
because<00:00:50.219> i<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> protect<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> screen<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
because i want to protect the screen a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
because i want to protect the screen a
little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> when<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:51.930> put<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> down

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
little bit so that when i put it down

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.160 
little bit so that when i put it down
doesn't<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> screen<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
doesn't put it down to in the screen I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
doesn't put it down to in the screen I
you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.289> try<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:55.710> sure<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.010> has

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you know I try to make sure that it has

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
you know I try to make sure that it has
all<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.399> holes<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> cutouts<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.629> has

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
all the holes in the cutouts this has

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.599 
all the holes in the cutouts this has
obviously<00:00:58.469> everything<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> need<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
obviously everything that you need and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.540 
obviously everything that you need and
then<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.989> look<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.320> protection<00:01:01.800> but

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
then and then I look for protection but

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.219 
then and then I look for protection but
of<00:01:02.670> course<00:01:02.699> i<00:01:02.969> always<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.960> thin

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of course i always want it to be as thin

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
of course i always want it to be as thin
as<00:01:04.260> possible<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.729> doesn't<00:01:06.030> even<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.390> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
as possible and this doesn't even have a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.760 
as possible and this doesn't even have a
back<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.869> how's<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> protect<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
back so how's it going to protect the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770 
back so how's it going to protect the
back<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.700> hand<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.210> true<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
back on the one hand that's true it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
back on the one hand that's true it
doesn't<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> back<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
doesn't have a back and and so it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.770 
doesn't have a back and and so it
doesn't<00:01:11.820> protect<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.360> something<00:01:12.540> were<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
doesn't protect it if something were to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
doesn't protect it if something were to
go<00:01:12.869> directly<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> other<00:01:14.610> hand

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
go directly at it but on the other hand

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
go directly at it but on the other hand
it<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.210> lip<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> top<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> on

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it has this little lip on the top and on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.880 
it has this little lip on the top and on
the<00:01:16.920> bottom<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> back<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the bottom on the back as well and the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.350 
the bottom on the back as well and the
benefit<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.119> put<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
benefit of that is that when you put it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
benefit of that is that when you put it
down<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:22.740> does<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.369> touch<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
down it actually does not touch the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
down it actually does not touch the
ground<00:01:24.259> when<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.290> lay<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.159> its<00:01:26.369> back

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
ground when you lay it down on its back

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.030 
ground when you lay it down on its back
so<00:01:27.180> you're<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.420> laying<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> wood<00:01:27.840> laying<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
so you're not laying the wood laying the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120 
so you're not laying the wood laying the
wood<00:01:29.360> down<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> table<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.020> anything<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
wood down on a table or anything and
