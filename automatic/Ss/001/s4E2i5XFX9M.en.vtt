00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
knitting microwave radiation and as you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.380 
knitting microwave radiation and as you
move<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> away<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.640> see<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.850> level<00:03:39.239> goes

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
move it away you can see the level goes

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.260 
move it away you can see the level goes
