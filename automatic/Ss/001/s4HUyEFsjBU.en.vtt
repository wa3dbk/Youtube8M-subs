00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
approach to these types of games I've

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.570 
approach to these types of games I've
recognized<00:03:15.960> that<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.010> some<00:03:17.280> skill

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
recognized that there is some skill

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.100 
recognized that there is some skill
involved<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.210> but<00:03:18.390> there's<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.600> high<00:03:18.900> degree

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
involved and but there's a high degree

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.960 
involved and but there's a high degree
of<00:03:19.290> luck<00:03:19.650> when<00:03:19.920> you're<00:03:20.070> having<00:03:20.370> these<00:03:20.490> random

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
of luck when you're having these random

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.630 
of luck when you're having these random
balls<00:03:21.270> fly<00:03:21.750> at<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.110> at<00:03:22.260> 50,000<00:03:23.220> miles<00:03:23.400> an<00:03:23.550> hour

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
balls fly at you at 50,000 miles an hour

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.960 
balls fly at you at 50,000 miles an hour
so<00:03:24.270> when<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> get<00:03:24.660> knocked<00:03:24.900> off<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.410> sort<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:25.770> just

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
so when I get knocked off I sort of just

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.670 
so when I get knocked off I sort of just
you<00:03:26.970> know<00:03:27.000> take<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.420> as<00:03:27.630> hey<00:03:28.050> that's<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.530> flow

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
you know take it as hey that's the flow

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.390 
you know take it as hey that's the flow
of<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.860> game

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
of the game

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.930 
of the game
