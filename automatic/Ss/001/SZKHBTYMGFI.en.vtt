other<00:02:43.930> ingredient<00:02:44.680> where<00:02:45.130> in<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.430> world<00:02:45.580> who

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
other ingredient where in the world who

corn spread on top of the tuna on top of

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.580 
corn spread on top of the tuna on top of
the<00:05:33.169> noodles<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:33.760> then<00:05:34.780> all<00:05:35.780> we<00:05:36.050> have<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.289> do

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
the noodles and then all we have to do

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.550 
the noodles and then all we have to do
is<00:05:36.940> get<00:05:37.940> our<00:05:40.060> crackers<00:05:41.060> come<00:05:41.479> over<00:05:41.750> here<00:05:41.990> and

is get our crackers come over here and
I'll<00:05:43.160> open<00:05:43.370> up<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:43.669> package<00:05:43.970> of<00:05:44.479> crackers

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
I'll open up this package of crackers

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.230 
I'll open up this package of crackers
and<00:05:45.380> that's<00:05:45.560> right<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.979> guessed<00:05:46.250> it<00:05:46.430> by<00:05:46.639> the

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
and that's right you guessed it by the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.750 
and that's right you guessed it by the
way<00:05:47.479> we<00:05:47.660> will<00:05:47.840> be<00:05:48.080> baking<00:05:48.500> this<00:05:48.680> at<00:05:50.260> 352

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
way we will be baking this at 352

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.040 
way we will be baking this at 352
degrees<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:57.610> probably<00:05:58.610> for<00:05:58.669> about<00:05:59.270> 15

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
degrees and probably for about 15

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.170 
degrees and probably for about 15
minutes<00:06:00.260> 20<00:06:01.099> minutes<00:06:01.130> or<00:06:01.520> 30<00:06:01.639> minutes<00:06:01.910> out<00:06:02.150> of

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
minutes 20 minutes or 30 minutes out of

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.360 
minutes 20 minutes or 30 minutes out of
here<00:06:02.470> whatever<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.560> want<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.830> make<00:06:03.949> it<00:06:04.130> tore

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
here whatever you want to make it tore

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.740 
here whatever you want to make it tore
and<00:06:05.590> or<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.770> can<00:06:06.949> make<00:06:07.130> it<00:06:07.280> 20<00:06:08.150> degrees<00:06:08.449> for

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
and or you can make it 20 degrees for

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.820 
and or you can make it 20 degrees for
352<00:06:09.500> minutes<00:06:09.949> but<00:06:10.160> here's<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:11.199> crackers<00:06:12.199> they

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
352 minutes but here's the crackers they

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.899 
352 minutes but here's the crackers they
get<00:06:13.039> broken<00:06:13.250> up<00:06:13.520> on<00:06:13.729> top<00:06:14.530> of<00:06:15.530> this<00:06:15.889> basic<00:06:16.520> idea

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
get broken up on top of this basic idea

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.920 
get broken up on top of this basic idea
of<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.120> baking<00:06:17.800> is<00:06:19.120> to<00:06:20.650> make<00:06:21.650> the<00:06:21.800> crackers

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
of the baking is to make the crackers

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.490 
of the baking is to make the crackers
become<00:06:23.930> brown<00:06:24.199> on<00:06:24.889> top<00:06:26.110> while<00:06:27.110> whatever

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
become brown on top while whatever

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.409 
become brown on top while whatever
shades<00:06:27.830> you<00:06:28.280> like<00:06:28.490> if<00:06:28.699> you<00:06:28.820> want<00:06:28.940> to<00:06:29.090> just<00:06:29.240> eat

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
shades you like if you want to just eat

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.490 
shades you like if you want to just eat
it<00:06:29.539> like<00:06:29.659> this<00:06:29.870> and

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
it like this and

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.290 
it like this and
you're<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.590> ones<00:06:32.770> going<00:06:33.010> to<00:06:33.130> be<00:06:33.280> it<00:06:33.430> to<00:06:33.670> make

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
you're the ones going to be it to make

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.040 
you're the ones going to be it to make
it<00:06:34.480> anyway<00:06:34.810> humpy<00:06:35.170> but<00:06:35.320> we've<00:06:35.440> got<00:06:35.700> noodles

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
it anyway humpy but we've got noodles

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.320 
it anyway humpy but we've got noodles

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
bottom in New then tuna hence the name

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.850 
bottom in New then tuna hence the name

trackers of the last ingredient now what
we<00:07:03.760> will<00:07:03.850> do<00:07:04.740> is<00:07:05.740> place<00:07:06.730> that<00:07:09.270> into<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.870> oven

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
we will do is place that into the oven

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.730 
we will do is place that into the oven
put<00:07:11.410> the<00:07:11.560> oven<00:07:11.650> up<00:07:11.830> that<00:07:12.180> 300<00:07:13.180> I've<00:07:13.630> got<00:07:13.810> 355<00:07:14.590> m

put the oven up that 300 I've got 355 m
they<00:07:15.130> get<00:07:15.310> 370<00:07:16.120> degrees<00:07:16.390> because<00:07:16.780> I<00:07:16.960> want<00:07:17.170> to

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
they get 370 degrees because I want to

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:26.790 
they get 370 degrees because I want to
and<00:07:17.590> into<00:07:18.340> the<00:07:18.370> oven<00:07:18.610> it<00:07:18.970> goes<00:07:24.210> and<00:07:25.740> now<00:07:26.740> we

and into the oven it goes and now we

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.350 
and into the oven it goes and now we
wait<00:07:28.950> okay<00:07:29.950> we<00:07:30.130> waited<00:07:30.460> what<00:07:31.090> we're<00:07:31.180> going<00:07:31.270> to

wait okay we waited what we're going to

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.060 
wait okay we waited what we're going to
do<00:07:31.510> is<00:07:31.600> take<00:07:31.780> it<00:07:31.810> out<00:07:31.990> of<00:07:32.020> the<00:07:32.200> oven<00:07:32.230> don't<00:07:33.010> know

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
do is take it out of the oven don't know

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.410 
do is take it out of the oven don't know
if<00:07:33.160> it's<00:07:33.250> really<00:07:33.490> done<00:07:33.790> yet<00:07:34.000> but<00:07:34.150> at<00:07:34.330> least

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
if it's really done yet but at least

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.620 
if it's really done yet but at least
we'll<00:07:34.630> get<00:07:34.720> the<00:07:34.870> ideal<00:07:35.260> and<00:07:36.300> getting<00:07:37.300> is<00:07:37.390> hot

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630 
we'll get the ideal and getting is hot

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:43.310 
we'll get the ideal and getting is hot
I'll<00:07:37.840> tell<00:07:38.050> you<00:07:38.140> that<00:07:38.520> I<00:07:39.520> had<00:07:40.030> it<00:07:40.150> about<00:07:40.240> 300<00:07:40.990> I

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.320 
I'll tell you that I had it about 300 I

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.310 
I'll tell you that I had it about 300 I
guess<00:07:44.320> 3<00:07:44.560> 65<00:07:45.160> to<00:07:45.460> 70<00:07:45.910> degrees<00:07:45.940> or<00:07:46.480> so<00:07:46.950> and<00:07:49.320> try

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.320 
guess 3 65 to 70 degrees or so and try

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.130 
guess 3 65 to 70 degrees or so and try
to<00:07:50.790> get<00:07:51.790> it<00:07:51.910> up<00:07:52.030> there<00:07:52.270> it's<00:07:53.550> still<00:07:55.140> cooking

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.140 
to get it up there it's still cooking

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.660 
to get it up there it's still cooking
there<00:07:56.320> as<00:07:56.410> far<00:07:56.590> as<00:07:56.740> the<00:07:56.830> grease<00:07:57.040> is<00:07:57.220> concerned

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:57.670 
there as far as the grease is concerned

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:05.000 
there as far as the grease is concerned
and<00:07:58.020> take<00:07:59.020> a<00:07:59.050> look<00:07:59.260> at<00:07:59.380> that<00:08:00.180> looks<00:08:02.370> almost

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.010 
and take a look at that looks almost

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.490 
and take a look at that looks almost
good<00:08:06.010> enough<00:08:06.040> to<00:08:06.460> eat
