Paul covered in this video yesterday I'm
going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.779> talking<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.380> guitar<00:00:20.279> tuning

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
going to be talking about guitar tuning

going to be talking about guitar tuning
this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> guitar<00:00:22.740> if<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.130> didn't<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.609> then

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this is a guitar if you didn't know then

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
this is a guitar if you didn't know then
you<00:00:24.869> probably<00:00:25.109> either<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.890> tourists<00:00:26.340> or

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you probably either not be tourists or

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
you probably either not be tourists or
you're<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.090> plain<00:00:27.330> doing<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> wrong<00:00:28.380> now<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you're just plain doing it wrong now the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
you're just plain doing it wrong now the
standard<00:00:29.369> way<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.699> people<00:00:29.820> two<00:00:30.150> guitars<00:00:30.510> is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
standard way that people two guitars is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840 
standard way that people two guitars is
in<00:00:31.380> standard<00:00:31.800> standard<00:00:32.040> tuning<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.700> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
in standard standard tuning which is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
in standard standard tuning which is
eadgbe<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:35.989> on<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> simple<00:00:37.559> chord

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
eadgbe that's be on with a simple chord

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.819 
eadgbe that's be on with a simple chord
structure<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:39.180> becomes<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:39.629> equal<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
structure that becomes an equal now the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
structure that becomes an equal now the
reason<00:00:41.040> people<00:00:41.430> choose<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.850> tuning<00:00:42.329> over<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
reason people choose this tuning over of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.049 
reason people choose this tuning over of
most<00:00:42.989> others<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> probably<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.879> luck

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
most others is probably just out of luck

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
most others is probably just out of luck
it's<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.930> tune<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.469> came<00:00:46.649> most

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's just the tune that they came most

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's just the tune that they came most
successful<00:00:47.460> that's<00:00:47.820> pretty<00:00:48.000> easy<00:00:48.120> chord

you'd<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.039> naive<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.090> was

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you'd be naive to think that that was

you'd be naive to think that that was
the<00:01:00.329> only<00:01:00.449> way<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.660> could<00:01:00.809> tune<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.289> guitar

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the only way you could tune your guitar

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
the only way you could tune your guitar
for<00:01:01.949> instance<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.670> turn<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.090> one

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
for instance if you just turn this one

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:12.060 
for instance if you just turn this one
down<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.560> drop<00:01:07.799> D<00:01:07.979> tuning

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.469 

which<00:01:13.070> leg<00:01:13.369> gives<00:01:13.579> a<00:01:13.670> whole<00:01:13.850> different<00:01:14.270> sound

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
which leg gives a whole different sound

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.810 
which leg gives a whole different sound
to<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.350> guitar<00:01:15.619> when<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:16.280> retune<00:01:16.759> the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
to the guitar when you retune the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.179 
to the guitar when you retune the
strings<00:01:17.179> on<00:01:17.329> a<00:01:17.359> guitar<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.990> changes<00:01:18.679> not<00:01:19.159> only

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
strings on a guitar it changes not only

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.219 
strings on a guitar it changes not only
the<00:01:19.670> pitch<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.179> individual<00:01:20.719> string<00:01:21.049> but

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
the pitch of the individual string but

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.800 
the pitch of the individual string but
it<00:01:21.320> also<00:01:21.469> changes<00:01:21.860> how<00:01:22.009> all<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.280> strings

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
it also changes how all the strings

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.779 
it also changes how all the strings
produce<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.990> sound<00:01:24.259> together<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.250> beyond

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
produce the sound together so beyond

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.450 
produce the sound together so beyond

and then if you place your finger on the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.570 
and then if you place your finger on the
second<00:01:42.900> fret<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> g<00:01:43.260> string<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.190> can<00:01:44.250> tune

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
second fret of the g string you can tune

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.149 
second fret of the g string you can tune
down<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.210> an<00:01:45.299> A<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:48.229> then<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> fifth<00:01:49.619> fret<00:01:49.920> on

down to an A and then the fifth fret on
that<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.670> string<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.270> indeed

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
that a string is indeed

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.390 
that a string is indeed

and<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.330> advantage<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> tuning<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and the advantage of this tuning is that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.460 
and the advantage of this tuning is that
cords<00:01:59.580> are<00:01:59.670> even<00:02:00.150> simpler<00:02:00.660> but<00:02:00.870> only<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
cords are even simpler but only in a

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.410 
cords are even simpler but only in a
certain<00:02:01.710> key<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.370> this<00:02:02.520> case<00:02:02.760> obviously<00:02:03.060> in

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
certain key in this case obviously in
