00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 the one that passes me is worth here we are in another 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 zombie guide this time to teach you to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.010
 build the new weapon that they have put 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 ok we are here in the tunnel area 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.500
 that we arrive we have to go down in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.330
 Half of the bus journey is worth 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 from the beginning there are times that I've 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 collected can be there where I have 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.330
 picked up by stairs where will be 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.460
 m16 too so or if it can not be 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 between some cars and others but look for it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.650
 Well, it's easy to find it here 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.949
 we would be in the second object is that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.989
 it would be like a trigger will work 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.000
 in plan trigger we are here to make a 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 totem the map of this that they have put like this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.010
 as hidden from astÃ©rix if you do not know how 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.899
 to arrive then I leave you in the annotation here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.789
 right now in the description of the video 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 how to get there we have the second piece 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.530
 that a colleague collects it so if 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 we play four as each one as they are 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 four objects because each one collects one 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.610
 if we play two then we're going to have to go 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.199
 adding us so well each one then 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.670
 he is doing it as he wants it is worth here 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.620
 well we just picked the second 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 object here we will be with the third 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.350
 we will be here in the part of this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.659
 of er 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 of electricity where we activate the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 electricity that you will also have a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.970
 tutorial to activate it here we collect 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 a kind of cables that look more 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.259
 well a thread but we're going to 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 call the cables there we pick it up what 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.460
 I pick up in this case so good ya 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 we will have our third object so 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.659
 we would only miss the last one to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.460
 me is the hardest so it costs 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 enough attention now in the one that comes 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.119
 the one that we have right now in screen 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.880
 we are in the area on the last map 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.470
 ok we have to go back no 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.869
 forward but backward and here 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.550
 we have to go glued to the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.810
 left me the beginning and towards the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.069
 right and I'm changing to the left 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.710
 I basically did not know how to get there 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.690
 but today I tell you from the last map 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.340
 we go back and we always go 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.929
 glued to the left do not worry 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.789
 they attack these bugs that are 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.649
 quite heavy in my opinion they are worth 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.140
 very very heavy but good we give 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.520
 five blades and that's it 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.289
 we follow on this part the left 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.479
 always always stuck to the left what 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.399
 more possible to the left and we continue 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.200
 until we find a cabin that 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.500
 will be good there will also be an ax for 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.910
 Hence we can not and do not see here 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.830
 ax cabin out there 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.770
 and well inside this cabin 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.370
 will be the bowie crop that if any 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.680
 I knew it 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.750
 there it is shining in blue blue 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.940
 and he good 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.740
 the valve the odometer what 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.950
 be this that it is a strange little object 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.319
 Well, it's here where I'm going to take it or 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.519
 in the 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:36.120
 on the stove well in the fireplace good 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:39.060
 we pick up the fourth object and then 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.590
 we would go directly to build it 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.639
 everything is fine to fit all the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.639
 objects to combine them is worth so now 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.299
 same as this we are waiting for 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.099
 come on 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.159
 another colleague to pick it up so nothing 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.590
 now he will come to pick it up and see you 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.269
 as I tell you in the creation of 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.379
 our object here we are 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.329
 we have to create it here 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.129
 obligatorily here it's worth in this area 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.480
 in the bar that we have to buy and 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.219
 simply because what we have to 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.629
 to do is with all the objects that we have 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.699
 gathered the four of us, we're going 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.010
 placing in this creation table and 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.199
 we are adding the pieces until placing 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.510
 the four here put the last one and already 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.879
 Well, do not let me catch it. I 'll call it 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.829
 jet boom because the name in spanish is 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.449
 quite long and not to mess up what 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.340
 dunga and it gives me in the parrot is the first 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.739
 Once I used it, it absorbs 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.939
 the zombies and as I just said 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.889
 it's the first one I used and did not 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.689
 I knew that it overheated and you look 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.850
 it will last me fifteen seconds look 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.310
 and I will gun 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.620
 seriously I did not know how to use it and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.630
 that's why it's gone so I do not expect anything 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.770

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.270
 quite so nothing greetings at all 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.140
