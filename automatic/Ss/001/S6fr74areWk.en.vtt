program<00:06:27.629> which<00:06:28.629> must<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.199> promote<00:06:29.499> efficiency

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
program which must to promote efficiency

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.369 
program which must to promote efficiency
in<00:06:32.999> components<00:06:33.999> like<00:06:34.120> this<00:06:34.360> so<00:06:34.689> eighty

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:35.379 
in components like this so eighty

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:40.860 
in components like this so eighty
percent<00:06:35.680> of<00:06:36.009> it<00:06:36.159> is<00:06:36.539> or<00:06:37.539> more<00:06:38.379> is<00:06:39.419> being<00:06:40.419> energy

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
percent of it is or more is being energy

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.040 
percent of it is or more is being energy
efficient<00:06:41.319> so<00:06:41.729> that's<00:06:42.729> always<00:06:42.909> good<00:06:43.050> yay

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
efficient so that's always good yay
