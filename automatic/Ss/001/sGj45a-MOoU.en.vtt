00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
they become closer and that's when you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
out to start as far as that the rankings

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.610 
out to start as far as that the rankings
are<00:00:57.989> concerned<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:59.039> buy<00:00:59.219> their<00:00:59.460> passage<00:01:00.620> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
are concerned you buy their passage that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000 
are concerned you buy their passage that
elevation<00:01:02.480> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.350> think<00:01:04.620> about<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
elevation if you do think about it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.760 
elevation if you do think about it
though<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.400> second<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.870> is<00:01:07.050> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> unfair

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
though for a second it is kind of unfair

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
though for a second it is kind of unfair
there<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.159> some<00:01:08.460> ways<00:01:08.730> it's<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> left<00:01:09.960> out

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there in some ways it's kind of left out

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
there in some ways it's kind of left out
of<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> team's<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.890> I'll<00:01:11.130> smell<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> they

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
of a team's here I'll smell know is they

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.850 
of a team's here I'll smell know is they
can<00:01:11.909> run<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> table<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.140> still<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.560> getting

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
can run the table and still not getting

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
can run the table and still not getting
that<00:01:13.920> championship<00:01:14.550> game<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.450> could

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that championship game which which could
