00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
putting one together it appears as far

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.169 
putting one together it appears as far
as<00:00:12.780> I've<00:00:12.900> taken<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.349> parts<00:00:13.650> off<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.040> far<00:00:14.340> that

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
as I've taken the parts off so far that

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.160 
as I've taken the parts off so far that
you<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.529> actually<00:00:16.949> remove<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
you do have to actually remove this

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.720 
you do have to actually remove this
handle<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> outer<00:00:21.470> door<00:00:22.470> skin<00:00:22.800> before

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
handle and the outer door skin before

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.480 
handle and the outer door skin before
you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.420> actually<00:00:24.750> gain<00:00:24.930> access<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.490> remove

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

the<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> trim<00:00:27.090> because<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.510> inner<00:00:27.689> trim<00:00:28.019> is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the in a trim because the inner trim is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.749 
the in a trim because the inner trim is
underneath<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:30.150> outer<00:00:30.199> so<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.550> piece

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
underneath the outer so now this piece

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.510 
underneath the outer so now this piece
comes<00:00:33.030> off<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.750> sliding<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.520> like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
comes off here just by sliding up like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
comes off here just by sliding up like
such<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.149> clips<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> edge<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
such it just clips in on the edge of the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.619 
such it just clips in on the edge of the
alloy<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.670> nothing<00:00:38.670> too<00:00:38.820> fancy<00:00:39.059> other<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
alloy there nothing too fancy other as a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.660 
alloy there nothing too fancy other as a
screw<00:00:39.960> from<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> back<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:46.219> maybe<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.340> should

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
screw from the back and maybe I should

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.700 
screw from the back and maybe I should
have<00:00:47.760> put<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> window<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.379> I'm

have put the window down first but I'm

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:58.790 
have put the window down first but I'm
not<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.329> cry<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.590> yeah

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

bits<00:01:03.619> not<00:01:04.619> surprising

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
bits not surprising

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.140 
bits not surprising
you're<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> pen

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.150 

we<00:01:13.150> go<00:01:13.300> wobble<00:01:13.720> wiggle<00:01:15.990> wiggle<00:01:16.990> wobble<00:01:17.590> wiggle

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.380 

now<00:01:21.160> betcha<00:01:21.460> there's<00:01:21.730> going<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.910> be<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.090> trick

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
now betcha there's going to be a trick

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.020 
now betcha there's going to be a trick
to<00:01:22.540> this<00:01:22.570> like<00:01:22.900> there<00:01:23.080> wasn't<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.500> other<00:01:23.620> bits

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to this like there wasn't the other bits

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.480 
to this like there wasn't the other bits
which<00:01:25.030> what<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.600> mean<00:01:25.870> here<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.790> that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
which what I mean here is is that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.219 
which what I mean here is is that
everything<00:01:30.490> kind<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.060> clips<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.660> pops<00:01:31.990> into

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
everything kind of clips and pops into

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.260 
everything kind of clips and pops into
place<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.700> not<00:01:33.970> really<00:01:35.550> screw<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.670> or<00:01:36.790> bolted

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
place it's not really screw it or bolted

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.830 
place it's not really screw it or bolted
as<00:01:37.420> such<00:01:37.630> as<00:01:37.840> you'd<00:01:37.960> imagine<00:01:39.660> that<00:01:40.660> one's

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
as such as you'd imagine that one's

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480 
as such as you'd imagine that one's
loose<00:01:41.110> now<00:01:41.290> anyway<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.649> that<00:01:41.979> will<00:01:42.100> let<00:01:42.250> me<00:01:42.280> get

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
loose now anyway so that will let me get

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.180 
loose now anyway so that will let me get
this<00:01:42.780> trim<00:01:43.780> off<00:01:43.899> you're<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.560> right<00:01:44.740> path

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.330 

maybe<00:01:48.190> not<00:01:49.290> maybe<00:01:50.290> not<00:01:50.470> maybe<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.979> still<00:01:51.220> have

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
maybe not maybe not maybe I still have

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.359 
maybe not maybe not maybe I still have
to<00:01:51.460> remove<00:01:51.670> something<00:01:52.000> else<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:57.100> no

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
to remove something else but there's no

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.469 
to remove something else but there's no
screws<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:58.330> skin<00:02:00.149> seems<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.360> be

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
screws in this skin seems to be

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.380 
screws in this skin seems to be
literally<00:02:01.899> just<00:02:02.080> clipped<00:02:02.440> into<00:02:02.770> place<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
literally just clipped into place so

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.920 
literally just clipped into place so
maybe<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.930> just<00:02:05.050> have<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.560> be<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:07.509> gentle

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
maybe I just have to be a little gentle

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.190 
maybe I just have to be a little gentle
and<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> little<00:02:08.410> forceful<00:02:08.770> at<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.130> same<00:02:09.369> time

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.560 

yep

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.140 

it<00:02:24.570> clips<00:02:24.960> into<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.770> there

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.429 

really<00:02:31.150> don't<00:02:31.390> want<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.599> break<00:02:31.840> anything<00:02:34.439> that

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
really don't want to break anything that

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.080 
really don't want to break anything that
would<00:02:35.590> cause<00:02:35.799> more<00:02:36.069> disasters<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.760> kind<00:02:40.000> of

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
would cause more disasters it's kind of

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.809 
would cause more disasters it's kind of
clipped<00:02:40.359> in<00:02:40.510> behind<00:02:40.930> there<00:02:41.469> so<00:02:42.310> if<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:42.670> can

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
clipped in behind there so if you can

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:52.600 
clipped in behind there so if you can
