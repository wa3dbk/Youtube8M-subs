00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
okay this is one of four videos I have

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520 
okay this is one of four videos I have
on<00:00:08.620> this<00:00:09.219> standard<00:00:09.820> now<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:11.110> is<00:00:11.230> the<00:00:11.290> sixth

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
on this standard now this is the sixth

on multiple the sum this particular

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.000 
on multiple the sum this particular
video<00:00:28.449> is<00:00:28.810> going<00:00:28.930> to<00:00:28.990> be<00:00:29.050> about<00:00:29.320> distributive

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
video is going to be about distributive

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.310 
video is going to be about distributive
property<00:00:30.429> and<00:00:30.609> just<00:00:30.640> trying<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.150> explain<00:00:31.420> what

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
property and just trying to explain what

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.229 
property and just trying to explain what
the<00:00:32.529> distributive<00:00:32.980> property<00:00:33.010> means<00:00:33.640> what<00:00:34.150> it

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
the distributive property means what it

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.619 
the distributive property means what it
is<00:00:34.510> how<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:34.900> use<00:00:35.199> it<00:00:35.410> so<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.250> way<00:00:36.489> this<00:00:37.210> part

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
is how you use it so that way this part

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.420 
is how you use it so that way this part
of<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.839> standard<00:00:38.229> can<00:00:38.500> be<00:00:38.530> done<00:00:38.830> well<00:00:39.100> and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
of the standard can be done well and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.969 
of the standard can be done well and
that<00:00:40.299> way<00:00:40.540> in<00:00:41.080> fact<00:00:41.260> this<00:00:41.500> video<00:00:41.739> should<00:00:41.890> be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 
that way in fact this video should be

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.740 
that way in fact this video should be
washed<00:00:42.220> before<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:43.000> watch<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.449> video<00:00:43.690> on

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
washed before you watch the video on

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.640 
washed before you watch the video on
multiple<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.379> a<00:00:44.440> sum<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:46.659> distribute

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
multiple of a sum to distribute

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.200 
multiple of a sum to distribute
something<00:00:47.979> think<00:00:48.640> about<00:00:48.879> when<00:00:49.059> we<00:00:49.150> think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
something think about when we think

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.700 
something think about when we think
about<00:00:49.299> distributive<00:00:49.839> property<00:00:50.260> we're<00:00:50.530> just

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
about distributive property we're just

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.380 
about distributive property we're just
talking<00:00:51.040> about<00:00:51.070> distributing<00:00:52.059> something

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
talking about distributing something

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.619 
talking about distributing something
like<00:00:52.869> you<00:00:53.019> would<00:00:53.290> distribute<00:00:54.449> pieces<00:00:55.449> of

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
like you would distribute pieces of

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.899 
like you would distribute pieces of
paper<00:00:55.869> to<00:00:56.470> everybody<00:00:57.159> in<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.369> room<00:00:57.580> you<00:00:57.820> want

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
paper to everybody in the room you want

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.729 
paper to everybody in the room you want
to<00:00:58.059> pass<00:00:58.239> one<00:00:58.510> out<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.900> everybody<00:00:59.110> in<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.710> room

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
to pass one out to everybody in the room

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.500 
to pass one out to everybody in the room
then<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.309> would<00:01:00.400> be<00:01:00.489> distributing<00:01:01.059> one<00:01:01.269> piece

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
then you would be distributing one piece

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.240 
then you would be distributing one piece
of<00:01:01.659> paper<00:01:01.839> to<00:01:02.170> every<00:01:02.439> single<00:01:02.739> person<00:01:03.040> in<00:01:03.159> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
of paper to every single person in the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.120 
of paper to every single person in the
room<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.689> think<00:01:04.900> about<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.500> then<00:01:06.010> you

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
room if you think about that then you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.040 
room if you think about that then you
understand<00:01:06.670> really<00:01:07.299> what<00:01:07.540> you're<00:01:07.660> doing<00:01:07.690> when

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
understand really what you're doing when

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.870 
understand really what you're doing when
you're<00:01:08.140> distributing<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:09.040> multiplication

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
you're distributing the multiplication

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.410 
you're distributing the multiplication
of<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.180> number<00:01:10.570> in<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.530> problem<00:01:11.800> like<00:01:12.100> this<00:01:12.430> but

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
of a number in a problem like this but

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.910 
of a number in a problem like this but
before<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:13.780> actually<00:01:13.990> show<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.380> how<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.620> use

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
before I actually show you how to use

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.770 
before I actually show you how to use
the<00:01:15.070> distributive<00:01:15.400> property<00:01:15.670> what<00:01:16.570> I'd<00:01:16.660> like

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
the distributive property what I'd like

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.640 
the distributive property what I'd like
to<00:01:16.840> do<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:19.270> take<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.810> problem<00:01:20.110> like<00:01:20.440> this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
to do is it is take a problem like this

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.260 
to do is it is take a problem like this
and<00:01:20.920> just<00:01:21.280> show<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.700> couple<00:01:21.880> different

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
and just show you a couple different

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.450 
and just show you a couple different
ways<00:01:22.300> of<00:01:22.600> solving<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:23.950> understand

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
ways of solving it so you understand

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.360 
ways of solving it so you understand
what<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.390> problem<00:01:25.750> means<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.380> problem<00:01:27.190> like

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
what the problem means a problem like

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:35.100 
what the problem means a problem like
this<00:01:30.270> means<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.990> are<00:01:33.600> multiplying<00:01:34.600> 3

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
this means that you are multiplying 3

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.790 
this means that you are multiplying 3
times<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.970> quantity<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.960> total<00:01:38.290> quantity<00:01:38.770> of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
times the quantity the total quantity of

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.940 
times the quantity the total quantity of
2<00:01:39.460> plus<00:01:39.760> 6<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.700> one<00:01:43.000> way<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:44.380> write<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.770> out

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
2 plus 6 so one way to write that out

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.920 
2 plus 6 so one way to write that out
would<00:01:45.250> be<00:01:45.479> 3<00:01:46.620> times<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:48.430> quantity<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:49.300> 2<00:01:49.630> plus

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
would be 3 times the quantity of 2 plus

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.120 
would be 3 times the quantity of 2 plus
6<00:01:50.260> which<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.710> when<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.159> add<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.430> up<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.820> 8<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
6 which is when you add that up is 8 and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.530 
6 which is when you add that up is 8 and
then<00:01:54.130> now<00:01:54.400> 3<00:01:55.120> times<00:01:55.540> 8<00:01:55.930> would<00:01:56.500> equal<00:01:56.890> 24<00:01:57.700> that's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
then now 3 times 8 would equal 24 that's

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.260 
then now 3 times 8 would equal 24 that's
what<00:01:58.990> that<00:01:59.170> problem<00:01:59.470> means<00:02:00.310> now<00:02:00.940> another<00:02:01.120> way

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
what that problem means now another way

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.260 
what that problem means now another way
to<00:02:01.299> think<00:02:01.570> about<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:02.020> same<00:02:02.320> problem<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:03.270> 3

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
to think about this same problem is 3

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.960 
to think about this same problem is 3
times<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.750> quantity<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:05.290> 2<00:02:05.470> plus<00:02:05.740> 6<00:02:06.070> means

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
times the quantity of 2 plus 6 means

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.090 
times the quantity of 2 plus 6 means
you're<00:02:07.930> taking<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.560> quantity<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.250> 2<00:02:09.549> plus<00:02:09.879> 6

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
you're taking the quantity of 2 plus 6

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.869 
you're taking the quantity of 2 plus 6
and<00:02:12.100> you're<00:02:12.640> adding<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.120> 3<00:02:13.540> times

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.500 

so<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:21.170> quantity<00:02:21.650> 2<00:02:21.950> plus<00:02:21.980> 6<00:02:22.700> 3

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
so you have the quantity 2 plus 6 3

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.530 
so you have the quantity 2 plus 6 3
times<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.519> were<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.730> add<00:02:25.879> all<00:02:26.269> these

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
times so if you were to add all these

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.710 
times so if you were to add all these
numbers<00:02:27.080> up<00:02:27.340> taking<00:02:28.340> each<00:02:28.580> parenthesis<00:02:29.330> set

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
numbers up taking each parenthesis set

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.720 
numbers up taking each parenthesis set
of<00:02:29.810> parenthesis<00:02:30.200> at<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.349> time<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.190> 2<00:02:31.459> plus

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
of parenthesis at a time you have 2 plus

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.559 
of parenthesis at a time you have 2 plus
6<00:02:32.080> equals<00:02:33.080> 8<00:02:33.440> plus<00:02:34.150> 2<00:02:35.150> plus<00:02:35.420> 6<00:02:35.720> equals<00:02:36.379> 8<00:02:36.709> plus<00:02:37.569> 2

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
6 equals 8 plus 2 plus 6 equals 8 plus 2

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.479 
6 equals 8 plus 2 plus 6 equals 8 plus 2
plus<00:02:38.810> 6<00:02:39.110> equals<00:02:39.769> 8<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:41.090> if<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.330> add<00:02:42.489> 8

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
plus 6 equals 8 and then if you add 8

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.259 
plus 6 equals 8 and then if you add 8
plus<00:02:43.549> 8<00:02:44.150> plus<00:02:44.180> 8<00:02:44.629> you<00:02:45.319> would<00:02:45.530> get<00:02:45.709> 24<00:02:46.610> because

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
plus 8 plus 8 you would get 24 because

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.839 
plus 8 plus 8 you would get 24 because
that<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.630> also<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.079> same<00:02:48.260> thing<00:02:48.290> as<00:02:48.620> 3<00:02:49.190> times<00:02:49.549> 8

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
that is also the same thing as 3 times 8

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.009 
that is also the same thing as 3 times 8
you<00:02:50.000> have<00:02:50.090> 8<00:02:50.299> 8<00:02:50.630> &amp;<00:02:50.780> 8<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.880> when<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.660> see<00:02:53.930> an

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
you have 8 8 &amp; 8 so when you see an

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.960 
you have 8 8 &amp; 8 so when you see an
expression<00:02:54.290> written<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:55.010> way<00:02:55.069> those<00:02:55.819> are

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
expression written in this way those are

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.120 
expression written in this way those are
two<00:02:56.120> ways<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.450> think<00:02:56.510> about<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.739> expression

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
two ways to think about the expression

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.830 
two ways to think about the expression
now<00:02:58.730> if<00:02:59.629> we<00:03:00.049> had<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:01.370> solve<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:01.910> problem<00:03:02.390> 3

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
now if we had to solve this problem 3

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.020 
now if we had to solve this problem 3
times<00:03:03.140> 2<00:03:03.530> plus<00:03:03.769> 6<00:03:04.069> using<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.640> distributive

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
times 2 plus 6 using the distributive

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.369 
times 2 plus 6 using the distributive
property<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.579> another<00:03:07.790> way<00:03:08.379> to

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
property that is just another way to

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.110 
property that is just another way to
think<00:03:09.590> about<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:10.129> problem<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.760> it's

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
think about this problem and it's

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.430 
think about this problem and it's
another<00:03:11.269> way<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.480> solve<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.870> problem<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
another way to solve this problem the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.460 
another way to solve this problem the
distributive<00:03:13.310> property<00:03:13.340> would<00:03:13.879> take<00:03:14.150> 3<00:03:15.110> this

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
distributive property would take 3 this

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.740 
distributive property would take 3 this
quantity<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.069> 3<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.849> it<00:03:17.629> would

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
quantity of 3 here and it would

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.300 
quantity of 3 here and it would
distribute<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.680> multiplication<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.760> 3<00:03:21.310> to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
distribute the multiplication of 3 to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.440 
distribute the multiplication of 3 to
the<00:03:22.639> 2<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.840> 6<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:26.239> for<00:03:26.389> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
the 2 and then the 6 so just for a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.520 
the 2 and then the 6 so just for a
second<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:26.930> go<00:03:27.049> back<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.410> this

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
second and when I go back to this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.300 
second and when I go back to this
previous<00:03:27.739> page<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:29.019> show<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:30.829> problem

previous page and show you this problem
right<00:03:31.489> here<00:03:31.849> are<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.450> when<00:03:32.959> we<00:03:33.049> wrote<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.319> out

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
right here are this when we wrote it out

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.280 
right here are this when we wrote it out
this<00:03:33.680> way<00:03:34.060> when<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.239> wrote<00:03:35.510> out<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.049> quantity

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
this way when we wrote out the quantity

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.559 
this way when we wrote out the quantity
of<00:03:36.500> 2<00:03:36.650> plus<00:03:36.889> 6<00:03:37.190> three<00:03:37.549> different<00:03:38.030> times

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
of 2 plus 6 three different times

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.620 
of 2 plus 6 three different times
what<00:03:38.810> we<00:03:38.989> see<00:03:39.319> is<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:40.160> put<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.269> different

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
what we see is I put this in a different

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.479 
what we see is I put this in a different
color<00:03:42.079> let's<00:03:42.560> do<00:03:42.709> purple<00:03:43.069> we<00:03:43.609> see<00:03:43.849> one<00:03:44.239> two

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
color let's do purple we see one two

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.690 
color let's do purple we see one two
three<00:03:46.660> twos<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.049> then<00:03:48.889> we<00:03:49.160> see<00:03:49.480> one<00:03:50.480> two<00:03:51.700> three

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
three twos and then we see one two three

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.390 
three twos and then we see one two three
sixes<00:03:53.599> so<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.620> can<00:03:54.709> hold<00:03:54.889> that<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.130> your<00:03:55.160> head

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
sixes so you can hold that in your head

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.009 
sixes so you can hold that in your head
for<00:03:55.579> a<00:03:55.609> second<00:03:56.060> if<00:03:56.269> we<00:03:56.510> did<00:03:57.370> 3<00:03:58.370> times<00:03:59.209> 2<00:03:59.660> and

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
for a second if we did 3 times 2 and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.610 
for a second if we did 3 times 2 and
then<00:04:00.190> 3<00:04:01.190> times<00:04:01.430> 6<00:04:03.220> we<00:04:04.450> would<00:04:05.450> be<00:04:05.660> holding<00:04:06.169> true

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
then 3 times 6 we would be holding true

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.240 
then 3 times 6 we would be holding true
to<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:08.319> written<00:04:09.319> form<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.889> approve<00:04:10.130> of

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
to this written form of the approve of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.430 
to this written form of the approve of
the<00:04:10.310> problem<00:04:10.730> so<00:04:11.239> now<00:04:11.419> let's<00:04:11.750> distribute<00:04:12.139> the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the problem so now let's distribute the

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.400 
the problem so now let's distribute the
multiplication<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.280> 3<00:04:13.579> to<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.269> 2<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.690> then<00:04:15.290> to

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
multiplication of 3 to the 2 and then to

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.900 
multiplication of 3 to the 2 and then to
the<00:04:15.530> 6<00:04:15.829> and<00:04:16.039> I'll<00:04:16.310> show<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.549> how<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.700> write

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
the 6 and I'll show you how you write

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.759 
the 6 and I'll show you how you write
that<00:04:17.030> out<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.690> you'd<00:04:17.810> write<00:04:17.959> 3<00:04:18.400> times<00:04:19.400> 2<00:04:20.769> plus

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
that out so you'd write 3 times 2 plus

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.490 
that out so you'd write 3 times 2 plus
because<00:04:22.280> that<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.820> operation<00:04:23.479> that's<00:04:24.260> in

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
because that is the operation that's in

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.890 
because that is the operation that's in
the<00:04:24.590> parentheses<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.729> now<00:04:25.849> we're<00:04:26.630> at<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.780> to

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
the parentheses and now we're at is to

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.330 
the parentheses and now we're at is to
be<00:04:26.990> 3<00:04:27.289> times<00:04:27.710> 6

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
be 3 times 6

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.020 
be 3 times 6
three<00:04:28.940> times<00:04:29.570> six<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.669> then<00:04:31.669> if<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:31.850> were<00:04:31.940> to

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
three times six and then if you were to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.400 
three times six and then if you were to
multiply<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.419> out<00:04:32.510> three<00:04:32.750> times<00:04:32.990> two<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.260> six

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
multiply that out three times two is six

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.900 
multiply that out three times two is six
plus<00:04:34.150> three<00:04:35.150> times<00:04:35.630> six<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.110> 18<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:36.979> then<00:04:37.580> six

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
plus three times six is 18 and then six

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.300 
plus three times six is 18 and then six
plus<00:04:38.210> 18<00:04:39.169> equals<00:04:40.210> 24<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.620> we<00:04:42.740> get<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:43.100> same

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
plus 18 equals 24 so we get the same

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.540 
plus 18 equals 24 so we get the same
answer<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.820> 24<00:04:44.360> that<00:04:44.810> we<00:04:44.960> got<00:04:45.139> here<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:45.860> here

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
answer of 24 that we got here and here

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.850 
answer of 24 that we got here and here
when<00:04:46.760> we<00:04:46.880> solved<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.300> two<00:04:47.449> other<00:04:47.660> ways<00:04:47.900> but

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
when we solved it two other ways but

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.250 
when we solved it two other ways but
what<00:04:49.040> we<00:04:49.160> did<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.430> instead<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.240> adding<00:04:50.540> up<00:04:50.990> to

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
what we did is instead of adding up to

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.129 
what we did is instead of adding up to
three<00:04:52.100> times<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.790> then<00:04:52.850> adding<00:04:53.150> up<00:04:53.270> six<00:04:53.540> three

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
three times and then adding up six three

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.250 
three times and then adding up six three
times<00:04:54.500> we<00:04:55.280> just<00:04:55.340> did<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.090> shortcut<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:56.990> use<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
times we just did a shortcut we use the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.379 
times we just did a shortcut we use the
distributive<00:04:57.410> property<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.220> multiply<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:59.360> 3

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
distributive property to multiply the 3

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.600 
distributive property to multiply the 3
times<00:05:00.229> 2<00:05:00.380> which<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.130> same<00:05:01.280> thing<00:05:01.490> as

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
times 2 which is the same thing as

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.000 
times 2 which is the same thing as
adding<00:05:01.760> up<00:05:02.060> two<00:05:02.240> three<00:05:02.540> times<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:03.139> then<00:05:03.590> three

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
adding up two three times and then three

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.129 
adding up two three times and then three
times<00:05:04.490> six<00:05:04.910> which<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> same<00:05:05.540> thing<00:05:05.960> as

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139

many reasons why you might use the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.900 
many reasons why you might use the
distributive<00:05:15.080> property<00:05:15.320> let's<00:05:16.280> say<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.550> have

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
distributive property let's say you have

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.590 
distributive property let's say you have
the<00:05:17.060> problem<00:05:17.479> 4<00:05:17.810> times<00:05:18.110> 36<00:05:19.000> let's<00:05:20.000> say<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.210> had

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
the problem 4 times 36 let's say you had

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.909 
the problem 4 times 36 let's say you had
to<00:05:20.840> buy<00:05:21.340> something<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.580> quantity<00:05:23.450> of<00:05:23.720> 36<00:05:24.500> let's

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
to buy something a quantity of 36 let's

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.090 
to buy something a quantity of 36 let's
say<00:05:25.100> there<00:05:26.000> were<00:05:26.180> bags<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.960> M&amp;Ms<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:27.979> each

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
say there were bags of M&amp;Ms and in each

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.580 
say there were bags of M&amp;Ms and in each
bag<00:05:28.430> there<00:05:29.030> were<00:05:29.120> 36<00:05:29.720> but<00:05:30.050> you<00:05:30.139> wanted<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.470> know

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
bag there were 36 but you wanted to know

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.469 
bag there were 36 but you wanted to know
how<00:05:30.770> many<00:05:30.830> M&amp;Ms<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.610> had<00:05:31.789> in<00:05:31.940> total<00:05:32.300> if<00:05:32.389> you

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
how many M&amp;Ms you had in total if you

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.909 
how many M&amp;Ms you had in total if you
bought<00:05:32.660> four<00:05:32.960> bags<00:05:33.200> but<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.650> couldn't

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
bought four bags but you couldn't

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.870 
bought four bags but you couldn't
multiply<00:05:34.100> 4<00:05:34.729> times<00:05:35.180> 36<00:05:35.450> in<00:05:35.720> your<00:05:35.840> head<00:05:35.990> quickly

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
multiply 4 times 36 in your head quickly

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.640 
multiply 4 times 36 in your head quickly
but<00:05:37.880> what<00:05:38.060> you<00:05:38.210> could<00:05:38.450> do<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.960> you<00:05:39.139> could<00:05:39.320> break

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
but what you could do is you could break

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.570 
but what you could do is you could break
up<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:42.050> actually<00:05:42.830> going<00:05:42.919> back<00:05:43.160> on<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.400> kind

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
up the actually going back on the kind

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.830 
up the actually going back on the kind
of<00:05:43.610> blue<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:44.090> can<00:05:44.210> break<00:05:44.479> up<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:46.060> 36<00:05:47.060> into

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.930 

parts<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.139> then<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.220> can<00:05:52.340> distribute<00:05:52.820> the

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
parts and then you can distribute the

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.870 
parts and then you can distribute the
multiplication<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.720> 4<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:54.590> parts<00:05:55.099> to

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
multiplication of 4 to the parts to

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.550 
multiplication of 4 to the parts to
figure<00:05:56.210> out<00:05:56.360> what<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.750> total<00:05:57.080> quantity<00:05:57.380> would

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
figure out what the total quantity would

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:07.300 
figure out what the total quantity would
be<00:05:57.669> let's<00:05:58.669> say<00:05:59.000> we<00:05:59.389> had<00:06:00.520> 30<00:06:04.330> plus<00:06:05.410> 6<00:06:06.410> we<00:06:07.099> know

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
be let's say we had 30 plus 6 we know

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.089 
be let's say we had 30 plus 6 we know
that<00:06:07.580> 36<00:06:08.030> can<00:06:08.120> be<00:06:08.180> broken<00:06:08.360> up<00:06:08.599> as<00:06:08.780> 30<00:06:09.110> plus<00:06:09.440> 6

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
that 36 can be broken up as 30 plus 6

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.600 
that 36 can be broken up as 30 plus 6
I<00:06:10.130> can<00:06:11.090> much<00:06:11.270> more<00:06:11.300> easily<00:06:11.620> multiply<00:06:12.620> 4<00:06:13.250> times

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
I can much more easily multiply 4 times

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.740 
I can much more easily multiply 4 times
30<00:06:14.410> and<00:06:17.080> then<00:06:18.080> 4<00:06:18.650> times<00:06:18.979> 6<00:06:19.370> then<00:06:19.910> I<00:06:19.940> can<00:06:20.389> if<00:06:20.630> I

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
30 and then 4 times 6 then I can if I

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.370 
30 and then 4 times 6 then I can if I
just<00:06:20.960> did<00:06:21.200> 4<00:06:21.530> times<00:06:21.889> 36<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:23.960> is<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.200> I'm<00:06:24.289> just

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
just did 4 times 36 that is it I'm just

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.560 
just did 4 times 36 that is it I'm just
doing<00:06:24.620> it<00:06:24.710> quickly<00:06:24.860> in<00:06:25.130> my<00:06:25.160> head<00:06:25.520> so<00:06:25.910> if<00:06:26.330> I

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
doing it quickly in my head so if I

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.890 
doing it quickly in my head so if I
wanted<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:26.990> use<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:28.190> distributive<00:06:28.460> property

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
wanted to use the distributive property

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.330 
wanted to use the distributive property
to<00:06:29.900> more<00:06:30.349> easily<00:06:30.590> and<00:06:31.039> we'll<00:06:31.130> do<00:06:31.250> the

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
to more easily and we'll do the

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.300 
to more easily and we'll do the
multiplication<00:06:31.370> in<00:06:31.940> my<00:06:32.030> head<00:06:32.240> I<00:06:32.450> can<00:06:33.050> take<00:06:33.770> 36

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
multiplication in my head I can take 36

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.480 
multiplication in my head I can take 36
break<00:06:35.150> it<00:06:35.300> down<00:06:35.419> into<00:06:35.599> 30<00:06:36.020> plus<00:06:36.380> 6<00:06:36.770> then

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
break it down into 30 plus 6 then

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.390 
break it down into 30 plus 6 then
multiply<00:06:38.180> 4<00:06:38.510> times<00:06:38.810> 30

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.290 

and<00:06:42.830> then<00:06:43.830> multiply<00:06:44.400> 4<00:06:44.639> times<00:06:44.669> 6<00:06:45.330> and<00:06:47.120> add<00:06:48.120> the

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
and then multiply 4 times 6 and add the

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.409 
and then multiply 4 times 6 and add the
2<00:06:48.510> so<00:06:49.260> if<00:06:49.320> I<00:06:49.410> did<00:06:49.560> 4<00:06:49.740> times<00:06:50.010> 30<00:06:50.280> I<00:06:50.370> would<00:06:50.580> get<00:06:50.669> 120

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
2 so if I did 4 times 30 I would get 120

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.320 
2 so if I did 4 times 30 I would get 120
and<00:06:51.900> if<00:06:52.350> I<00:06:52.440> did<00:06:52.590> 4<00:06:52.800> times<00:06:53.070> 6<00:06:53.310> I<00:06:53.460> would<00:06:53.550> get<00:06:53.699> 24

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
and if I did 4 times 6 I would get 24

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.080 
and if I did 4 times 6 I would get 24
and<00:06:54.630> if<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.590> add<00:06:55.770> the<00:06:55.919> 2<00:06:56.130> I<00:06:56.400> would<00:06:56.699> get<00:06:56.820> hundred

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
and if I add the 2 I would get hundred

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.689 
and if I add the 2 I would get hundred
forty-four<00:06:57.570> that<00:06:58.320> is<00:06:58.590> a<00:06:58.620> lot<00:06:58.860> easier<00:06:58.889> to<00:06:59.550> get

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
forty-four that is a lot easier to get

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.770 
forty-four that is a lot easier to get
to<00:06:59.760> then<00:07:00.650> 4<00:07:01.650> times<00:07:01.919> 36<00:07:02.250> if<00:07:03.240> you're<00:07:03.479> doing<00:07:03.630> this

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
to then 4 times 36 if you're doing this

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.990 
to then 4 times 36 if you're doing this
in<00:07:03.840> your<00:07:03.990> head<00:07:04.290> I<00:07:04.500> know<00:07:04.949> it<00:07:05.160> means<00:07:05.340> you're

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
in your head I know it means you're

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.920 
in your head I know it means you're
writing<00:07:06.330> more<00:07:06.479> on<00:07:06.720> the<00:07:07.729> on<00:07:08.729> the<00:07:09.060> on<00:07:09.479> the<00:07:09.600> table

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
writing more on the on the on the table

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.740 
writing more on the on the on the table
here<00:07:10.110> but<00:07:10.320> you<00:07:10.650> in<00:07:11.400> your<00:07:11.580> head<00:07:11.760> it's<00:07:12.180> easier<00:07:12.600> to

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
here but you in your head it's easier to

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.580 
here but you in your head it's easier to
multiply<00:07:13.169> with<00:07:13.560> these<00:07:13.910> smaller<00:07:14.910> numbers

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
multiply with these smaller numbers

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.719 
multiply with these smaller numbers
possibly<00:07:16.590> and<00:07:16.800> that<00:07:17.070> would<00:07:17.190> be<00:07:17.280> one<00:07:17.430> reason

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
possibly and that would be one reason

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.110 
possibly and that would be one reason
why<00:07:17.760> you<00:07:17.910> might<00:07:18.090> use<00:07:18.120> distributive<00:07:18.750> property
