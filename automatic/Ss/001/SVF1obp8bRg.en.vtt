00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
stun them right there done is done now

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.729 
stun them right there done is done now
this<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:33.970> where<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.329> door<00:02:34.630> locking<00:02:34.959> me<00:02:35.290> see

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
this is where the door locking me see

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
charge beam okay we have to find more

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.970 
charge beam okay we have to find more
realistic<00:02:39.940> open<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:40.720> that's<00:02:41.019> one<00:02:41.440> reminder

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
realistic open it up that's one reminder

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.150 
realistic open it up that's one reminder
you<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:42.790> see<00:02:42.940> right<00:02:42.970> there

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
and open it up and get the charge beam

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.620 
and open it up and get the charge beam
just<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.400> be<00:03:51.520> very<00:03:51.760> useful<00:03:51.910> now<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.600> I

we go here scan them and opens up
alright<00:04:05.170> charge<00:04:05.650> being<00:04:05.980> right<00:04:06.580> here<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:07.240> will

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
alright charge being right here I will

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.810 
alright charge being right here I will
roll<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.380> cuts<00:04:08.740> and<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.130> talked<00:04:09.459> about<00:04:09.490> the
