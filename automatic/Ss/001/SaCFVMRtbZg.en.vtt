00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
with its wires running into the control

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
with its wires running into the control
box<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:36.930> keep<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.530> mind<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:37.920> dual

box here now keep in mind I have dual
speed<00:00:38.820> controllers<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> got<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.200> down

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
speed controllers here so I got one down

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.280 
speed controllers here so I got one down
on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> bottom<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.370> top<00:00:41.629> my<00:00:42.629> two<00:00:42.690> battery

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
on the bottom one on top my two battery

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160 
on the bottom one on top my two battery
packs<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.920> along<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:45.270> radio<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
packs here along with my radio in the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.500 
packs here along with my radio in the
center<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.879> then<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> motor<00:00:48.239> leads

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
center there and then the motor leads

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.380 
center there and then the motor leads

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
for the front motor right up front here

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.619 
for the front motor right up front here
now<00:00:51.390> running<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.780> dual<00:00:52.140> motor<00:00:52.440> setup<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.980> this

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
now running a dual motor setup like this

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
now running a dual motor setup like this
gives<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> lot<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.079> torque<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.829> climbing

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
gives you a lot more torque for climbing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.340 
gives you a lot more torque for climbing
up<00:00:56.250> hills<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.890> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.980> lot<00:00:59.129> smoother<00:00:59.699> because

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
up hills and it's a lot smoother because

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.810 
up hills and it's a lot smoother because
with<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.559> motor<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.160> noticing<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
with one motor I was noticing I had a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
with one motor I was noticing I had a
lot<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.300> cogging<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> motor<00:01:04.350> kind

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
lot of like cogging like the motor kind

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
lot of like cogging like the motor kind
of<00:01:04.830> pulse<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.090> along<00:01:06.650> but<00:01:07.650> now

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
of pulse as I was going along but now

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
of pulse as I was going along but now
with<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.150> makes<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
with two it kind of makes up for that so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
with two it kind of makes up for that so
it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> lot<00:01:10.409> smoother<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.100> haven't<00:01:12.000> had<00:01:12.090> any

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it's a lot smoother I haven't had any

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
it's a lot smoother I haven't had any
issues<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.630> hills<00:01:13.020> whatsoever<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
issues with hills whatsoever and it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.590 
issues with hills whatsoever and it
makes<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> much<00:01:15.240> nicer<00:01:15.420> ride<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:17.600> let's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
makes for a much nicer ride so let's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:02:53.559 
makes for a much nicer ride so let's
take<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> for

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:07.900 

you
