00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
away with them I would lock it so they

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.590

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
but they maybe want to just take it with

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.060 
but they maybe want to just take it with
them<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.220> open<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.730> at<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> later<00:03:30.180> time<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:31.070> I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
them and open it at a later time and I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.860 
them and open it at a later time and I
would<00:03:32.280> recommend<00:03:32.459> also<00:03:33.180> putting<00:03:33.570> some

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
would recommend also putting some

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.770 
would recommend also putting some
valuables<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.730> they<00:03:36.480> feel<00:03:36.720> that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
valuables in it so that they feel that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.130

they're hopefully not coming back

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.280
