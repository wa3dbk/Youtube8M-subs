00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.220
 the military police service 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.630
 was initially content and isolate the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 place of the crime so that the civilian police 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.229
 can work in a situation a little 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.880
 best 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.380
 we are looking to make the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.750

 reach people have had with us one 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.310
 start a conversation with some 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.990
 people here right now because this is natural 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.969
 people initially feel 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.340
 little scared 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.039
 but with the presence of the police and a 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.710
 a good conversation there usually begins 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.649
 appear the information now 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.039
 information that he was in the 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.660
 when the killers would have arrived and mp 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.970
 when he noticed the arrival of the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.160
 killers he tried to run here he 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.799
 was murdered the police received 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 information here from someone 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.480
 how many people were the killers 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 were on a bike bike piece the dice 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.410
 exact is about that about people and 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.930
 more information on how it was done 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 this murder has not been passed on 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.750
 that I have been told so far has been 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.880
 How did the clash come here to see you? 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430
 keeping in touch with the child is a fan of 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.040
 real they said he received a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.470
 phone call and that's what he got 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.739
 phone call and came to meet 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.269
 someone here then I through this 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.879
 of this information that we will do 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.620
 a survey and has relatives of him 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.610
 that place does not want to record interview 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.290
 scared is a right that they have but 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.180
 that calls attention is that this boy 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.200
 according to their own information 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.600
 relatives 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.850
 he was a witness to a murder or 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.829
 whether you witnessed a person being 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.290
 murdered 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.349
 possibly this crime there has something to 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.900
 with this fact of having witnessed and 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.569
 murder there is information to family members 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.940
 them have already been passed on to you in 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.470
 homicide that the classic it is 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.060
 witness of a murder 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.190
 this is also a line one of the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.700
 main lines of investigation for 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.530
 start and try to elucidate whether it has 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.000
 witness but has other other nuances 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.160
 there are other situations that have already happened 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.530
 with him and that we can not rule out 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.150
 because if we say that it was 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.099
 victim of a murder in which he teaches 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.560
 a situation that has nothing yet 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.989
 everything can be can be this can have a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.660
 big chance and have can be father of 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.540
 drug it may be because of a situation with 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.190
 a friction that had a long time ago and that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.380
 was not murdered because he can 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.569
 being because it was a retaliation for 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.489
 of what was near then has 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.500
 several lines of action in which we do not 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.010
 likes to set it from now on to not 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.670
 be lighthearted we already have 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.829
 is for that really introduces the accused 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.540
 to disappear can be informed by the 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.820
 amount of people who have seen here 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.109
 but be sure that working together 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.270
 with homicide police will 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.380
 unravel this crime that happened 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.380
 It can be right here.
