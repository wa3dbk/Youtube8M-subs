00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.520 
with the bar now I've added a 25 to each
side<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:11.450> hopefully<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.870> get<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.320> 5

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
side and hopefully I can get it for 5

00:00:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
side and hopefully I can get it for 5
reps<00:00:13.799> let's<00:00:14.219> find<00:00:14.429> out

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.200 

but<00:01:17.550> definitely<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.799> squats<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.580> then<00:01:21.940> I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
but definitely like squats and then I

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.899 
but definitely like squats and then I
thought<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.960> would<00:01:23.049> be<00:01:23.229> hum<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.330> once<00:01:25.509> again

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
thought it would be hum but once again

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.430 
thought it would be hum but once again
this<00:01:27.909> is<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.119> starting<00:01:28.630> point<00:01:28.690> where<00:01:29.200> I'm

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
this is a starting point where I'm

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.540 
this is a starting point where I'm
starting<00:01:29.890> point<00:01:30.160> so<00:01:31.890> something<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.950> build<00:01:33.160> on

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
starting point so something to build on

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.880 
starting point so something to build on
and<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:34.539> can't<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.080> nothing<00:01:35.350> but<00:01:35.380> get<00:01:35.560> stronger

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890
