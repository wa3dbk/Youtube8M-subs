armature and the flywheel is important

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.330 
armature and the flywheel is important
because<00:02:37.900> if<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.290> too<00:02:38.680> too<00:02:38.950> much<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.280> a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
because if you have too too much of a

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.060 
because if you have too too much of a
distance<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.660> will<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.200> will<00:02:41.320> decrease<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
distance it will it will decrease the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.680 
distance it will it will decrease the
amount<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.370> energy<00:02:42.640> that's<00:02:42.850> induced<00:02:43.209> into<00:02:43.600> the

amount of energy that's induced into the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.770 
amount of energy that's induced into the
the<00:02:44.050> armature<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.820> if<00:02:45.820> it's<00:02:46.030> too<00:02:46.270> close<00:02:46.570> you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the armature and if it's too close you

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.330 
the armature and if it's too close you
can<00:02:46.930> actually<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.650> armature<00:02:47.890> hit<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
can actually have the armature hit the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.250 
can actually have the armature hit the
flywheel<00:02:48.850> which<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.360> what's<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.989> damage

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
flywheel which is what's going to damage

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.280 
flywheel which is what's going to damage
something<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.120> important<00:02:52.600> that<00:02:52.630> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
something so it's important that that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.410 
something so it's important that that
the<00:02:53.590> armature<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.280> set<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> certain<00:02:54.850> distance

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the armature be set a certain distance

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.590 
the armature be set a certain distance
from<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.840> flywheel<00:02:56.080> on<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:58.270> particular

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
from the flywheel on this particular

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.780 
from the flywheel on this particular
engine<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.320> distance<00:02:59.770> between<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.280> flywheel

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
engine the distance between the flywheel

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.699 
engine the distance between the flywheel
and<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.239> armature<00:03:01.510> should<00:03:01.900> be<00:03:02.050> six<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.530> ten

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
and the armature should be six to ten

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.770 
and the armature should be six to ten
thousandths<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.280> an<00:03:03.430> inch<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.600> can

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
thousandths of an inch and you can

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.270 
thousandths of an inch and you can
there's<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.200> couple<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.560> ways<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.739> can<00:03:06.070> set

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
there's a couple of ways you can set

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.650 
there's a couple of ways you can set
that<00:03:06.489> distance<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.300> either<00:03:07.450> use<00:03:07.630> a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
that distance you can either use a

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.570 
that distance you can either use a

an easier way of doing it if you get an
index<00:03:29.980> card<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.579> is<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.940> regular<00:03:31.230> index

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
index card this is just a regular index

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.820 
index card this is just a regular index
card<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:32.829> find<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
card you can find it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.130 
card you can find it
hardware<00:03:34.250> store<00:03:34.610> not<00:03:34.850> hardware<00:03:35.210> but<00:03:35.390> any<00:03:35.570> like

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
hardware store not hardware but any like

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.660 
hardware store not hardware but any like
drugstore<00:03:36.650> like<00:03:36.800> Walmart<00:03:37.280> or<00:03:37.400> something<00:03:39.670> I'll

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
drugstore like Walmart or something I'll

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.610 
drugstore like Walmart or something I'll
show<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.030> here<00:03:41.330> with<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.960> got<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.290> set<00:03:42.530> of

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
show you here with a I got a set of

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.310 
show you here with a I got a set of
calipers<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.210> measure<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.750> thickness<00:03:47.990> of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
calipers if you measure the thickness of

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.490 
calipers if you measure the thickness of
the<00:03:48.440> index<00:03:48.800> card<00:03:49.660> you'll<00:03:50.660> see<00:03:50.900> it's<00:03:51.110> 7

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
the index card you'll see it's 7

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.290 
the index card you'll see it's 7
thousandths<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.040> an<00:03:52.190> inch<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.760> can<00:03:52.790> read<00:03:53.120> that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
thousandths of an inch you can read that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.300 
thousandths of an inch you can read that
in<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.620> camera<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:56.380> that's<00:03:57.380> right<00:03:57.830> in<00:03:57.980> between

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
in the camera so that's right in between

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.130 
in the camera so that's right in between
six<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.730> ten<00:03:59.030> thousand<00:03:59.390> seven<00:03:59.630> inch<00:03:59.780> witches

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
six and ten thousand seven inch witches

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.560 
six and ten thousand seven inch witches
which<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> correct<00:04:01.180> measurement<00:04:02.180> for<00:04:02.420> the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
which is a correct measurement for the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.850 
which is a correct measurement for the
distance<00:04:03.050> between<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.380> armature<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.770> the

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
distance between the armature and the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.040 
distance between the armature and the
flywheel<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.520> what<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.390> do<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.720> insert

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
flywheel so what you do is you insert

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.340 
flywheel so what you do is you insert
the<00:04:06.230> index<00:04:06.560> card<00:04:06.830> in<00:04:06.980> between<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.350> armature

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
the index card in between the armature

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.430 
the index card in between the armature
and<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.710> flywheel<00:04:10.180> then<00:04:11.180> wrote<00:04:11.510> hold<00:04:12.140> on<00:04:12.290> to

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
and the flywheel then wrote hold on to

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.590 
and the flywheel then wrote hold on to
the<00:04:12.590> armature<00:04:13.040> rotate<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.760> flywheel<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.420> that

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
the armature rotate the flywheel so that

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.729 
the armature rotate the flywheel so that
the<00:04:14.690> magnets<00:04:15.970> are<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.390> front<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.230> armature

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
the magnets are in front of the armature

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.520 
the magnets are in front of the armature
and<00:04:19.150> let<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.269> armature<00:04:20.690> go<00:04:20.810> let<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.109> magnet

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
and let the armature go let the magnet

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.260 
and let the armature go let the magnet
pull<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.799> armature<00:04:22.220> towards<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.730> flywheel

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
pull the armature towards the flywheel

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.410 
pull the armature towards the flywheel
and<00:04:23.650> let<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.770> magnets<00:04:25.160> hold<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.640> armature

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
and let the magnets hold the armature

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.670 
and let the magnets hold the armature
there<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:26.900> then<00:04:27.970> tighten<00:04:28.970> down<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.680> holding

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
there and then tighten down the holding

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
there and then tighten down the holding
screws<00:04:34.360> turn<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.540> flywheel<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.460> remove<00:04:37.460> your

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
screws turn the flywheel and remove your

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.080 
screws turn the flywheel and remove your
index<00:04:38.330> card<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.840> there<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.020> go

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
index card and there you go

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.850 
index card and there you go
you<00:04:41.090> adjusted<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.750> correct<00:04:42.440> distance

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
you adjusted the correct distance

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.530 
you adjusted the correct distance
between<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.460> armature<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.270> flywheel

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
between the armature and the flywheel

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.470 
between the armature and the flywheel
using<00:04:45.080> an<00:04:45.200> index<00:04:45.470> card<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.640> it's<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.330> lot

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
using an index card and it's a lot

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.090 
using an index card and it's a lot
easier<00:04:47.840> than<00:04:47.960> using<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.350> feeler<00:04:48.650> gauge

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.230 

adjusting<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.220> armature<00:04:55.640> isn't<00:04:55.940> something

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
adjusting the armature isn't something

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.030 
adjusting the armature isn't something
that<00:04:56.330> needs<00:04:56.480> to<00:04:56.600> be<00:04:56.630> done<00:04:56.900> very<00:04:57.200> often<00:04:57.410> it's

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
that needs to be done very often it's

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.710 
that needs to be done very often it's
usually<00:04:58.340> only<00:04:58.640> done<00:04:58.940> when<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.270> disassemble

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
usually only done when you disassemble

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.200 
usually only done when you disassemble
the<00:05:00.080> engine<00:05:00.280> when<00:05:01.280> you<00:05:01.370> loosen<00:05:01.669> up<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.910> screws

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
the engine when you loosen up the screws

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.490 
the engine when you loosen up the screws
that<00:05:02.390> hold<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.690> armature<00:05:03.050> down<00:05:03.230> then<00:05:03.410> you

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
that hold the armature down then you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.000 
that hold the armature down then you
have<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.770> readjust<00:05:03.980> it<00:05:05.290> but<00:05:06.290> any<00:05:06.410> but<00:05:06.620> it<00:05:06.740> is<00:05:06.860> an

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
have to readjust it but any but it is an

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.720 
have to readjust it but any but it is an
important<00:05:08.020> spec<00:05:09.020> for<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.770> engine<00:05:10.070> like<00:05:10.610> I

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
important spec for the engine like I

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.340 
important spec for the engine like I
said<00:05:10.970> if<00:05:11.090> it's<00:05:11.150> too<00:05:11.390> far<00:05:11.570> away<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.900> get<00:05:12.140> you

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
said if it's too far away you get you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.780 
said if it's too far away you get you
get<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.830> get<00:05:12.890> a<00:05:12.950> lower<00:05:13.190> voltage<00:05:13.400> at<00:05:13.730> the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
get a you get a lower voltage at the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.460 
get a you get a lower voltage at the
spark<00:05:14.090> plug<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.360> if<00:05:14.630> it's<00:05:14.750> too<00:05:14.930> close<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.350> can

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
spark plug and if it's too close you can

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.310 
spark plug and if it's too close you can
hit<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.710> flywheel<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:17.210> anyway<00:05:18.110> after<00:05:18.290> you

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
hit the flywheel but anyway after you

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.600 
hit the flywheel but anyway after you
after<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.740> adjust<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.310> can<00:05:19.430> go<00:05:19.550> ahead

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
after you adjust that you can go ahead

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.130 
after you adjust that you can go ahead
and<00:05:19.790> reassemble<00:05:19.970> your<00:05:20.390> engine<00:05:20.630> shroud<00:05:20.810> and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
and reassemble your engine shroud and

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.230 
and reassemble your engine shroud and
gas<00:05:21.410> tank<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:21.979> let's<00:05:22.310> just<00:05:22.729> reverse<00:05:23.030> the

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
gas tank and let's just reverse the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.400 
gas tank and let's just reverse the
order<00:05:23.419> that<00:05:23.570> I<00:05:23.660> took<00:05:23.720> them<00:05:23.990> off<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:26.200> that's<00:05:27.200> it

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
order that I took them off and that's it

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.620 
order that I took them off and that's it
so<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.190> hope<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:28.640> found<00:05:28.760> this<00:05:28.940> video<00:05:29.150> helpful
