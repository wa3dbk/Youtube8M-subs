00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.139
 she just came here on 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.150
 our slopes to courchevel the first lady 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.000
 e electric hybrid in the world 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.340
 the ice3 v has just acquired this jewel of 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.119
 technology and innovation the track 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.630
 bully 601 plus costed nearly 350000 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.090
 euros 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.680
 still an investment effort for 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.090
 guide to respect the environment 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 with fewer releases to the atmosphere 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.040
 good seventies even when the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.660
 material has evolved tremendously I 'm not 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.129
 if you have the opportunity to see the snow 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.310
 katako chauvel so the first machine 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.450
 of damages and when we see the product 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.430
 we have today that is has still 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.120
 evolved well the motorization which a 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.550
 400 horsepower mercedes engine that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.190
 drives an electric generator that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.680
 it provides power to the late arbaud 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.780
 they learn and barbuda that's 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.690
 simply to advance the machine 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.909
 so that model I make unique in the world 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.700
 it is the first machine of this type 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.920
 sold of material that consumes 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.170
 a lot less fuel 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.080
 a 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.549
 energy Thursday 28 years is equal or your 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.540
 machine 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.820
 but with a less powerful engine 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.869
 simply there is a motor that drives 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.580
 an electric generator 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.680
 there is no battery the generator 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.659
 electric makes current that is 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.690
 directly redistribute to the booty 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.729
 right to the left gypsy and to the engine of 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.920
 fred in defense have closed more than 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.869
 fuel because I 'll go late gravity 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.159
 the generator turn all crazy and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.289
 she makes curves simply 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 never come true to come make it a 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.360
 ride with me follow me 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.670
 and quieter than machines yes 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.530
 give you all Paris 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.700
 control would need in number and in 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.560
 forget 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 detach we'll open it work in 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.390
 lanaudiÃ¨re for someone ghost 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.760
 in 124 means a lot more 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.470
 force at 11 kilometers hour effect 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.630
 get the most out of 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.780
 says certain power allow us to 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.780
 go out 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.390
 kra makes a good first round 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.020
 attention if different ways and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.160
 will end 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.660
 of the dream so the electric 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.020
 does not have the same 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.850
 trailer 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.170
 it's me who says club 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.400
 the bank during machine compared 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.660
 to other senators that she survive 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.730
 the other 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.970
 the nature thermal engines is too much 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 exemptions 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:35.129
 his person finally% fuel - yes 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.810
 you dream to fill during the period 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.049
 of holidays so I answer you pronounce 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.049
 too much 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.770
 it's 20 percent fewer emissions 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.230
 co2 in the air is very important for 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.490
 a ski area quite nine years old 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 we mingle we try to do 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.490
 than anything else I create for 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.580
 the environment 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.680
 when we buy the tool judge by that 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.020
 optimizes the cost of fuel 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.150
 but our primary motivation is not 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.720
 there the motivation first is really 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.489
 to show our willingness to 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.870
 participate in the ecological component 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.410
 sustainable development of 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.209
 winter sports 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.220
 because today even though a 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.569
 save 20 francs without it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.700
 unfortunately not to amortize the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.620
 the additional cost of buying the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.569
 machine that is over 300000 euros 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.859
 so there are almost 150 videos of 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.459
 difference between a conventional machine 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:29.400
 and a hybrid machine so even if 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.090
 20% fuel helps 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.549
 the investment that's just the s3v 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.450
 is master in the tip of 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.730
 innovation 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.500
 this machine is out there for the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.299
 first time in France this year and 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 even in the world and we wanted to be the 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.419
 first to offer 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.889
 and I also think it's important 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.049
 that big resorts like 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.909
 Courchevel is also at the initiative 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.769
 to allow builders to 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.090
 develop these tools there if he 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.859
 revenge never they will ever happen 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.049
 to develop them refine them 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.280
 tweaking so that's why we 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.280
 answered right now
