charging cable that lights up so as you
can<00:02:59.160> see<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.790> very<00:02:59.880> basic<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
can see it's very basic but the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.560 
can see it's very basic but the
all-important<00:03:03.480> part<00:03:03.810> our<00:03:04.620> jumper<00:03:05.520> cables<00:03:05.850> so

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
all you have to do for that is plug it

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.030 
all you have to do for that is plug it
in

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.980 

put<00:03:14.040> these<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.640> your<00:03:15.120> battery<00:03:15.270> terminals<00:03:15.810> and

put these on your battery terminals and
you're<00:03:16.440> literally<00:03:16.770> ready<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> go<00:03:17.460> by<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.700> time

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
you're literally ready to go by the time

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.110 
you're literally ready to go by the time
you<00:03:18.060> get<00:03:18.210> into<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.620> cab<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.890> your<00:03:20.460> car<00:03:20.910> or

you get into the cab of your car or

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.450 
you get into the cab of your car or
truck<00:03:21.270> or<00:03:21.600> whatever<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.110> are<00:03:22.380> trying<00:03:23.250> to

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
truck or whatever you are trying to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.790 
truck or whatever you are trying to
jumpstart<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.510> should<00:03:25.080> give<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.350> enough<00:03:25.530> juice

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
jumpstart it should give it enough juice

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.280 
jumpstart it should give it enough juice
and<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:26.310> turn<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.610> key<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.290> you're

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and you just turn the key and you're

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.410 
and you just turn the key and you're
good<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:29.490> thing<00:03:29.700> I'd<00:03:29.820> recommend<00:03:29.940> about

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
good the one thing I'd recommend about

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
good the one thing I'd recommend about
this<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.410> clamp<00:03:32.250> these<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.000> then<00:03:33.440> plug

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
this is to clamp these on and then plug

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.840 
this is to clamp these on and then plug
it<00:03:34.560> into<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.160> don't<00:03:35.310> have<00:03:35.460> these<00:03:36.210> too

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
it into this so you don't have these too

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.660 
it into this so you don't have these too
touching<00:03:38.850> that's<00:03:39.060> very<00:03:39.360> bad

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
touching that's very bad

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.480 
touching that's very bad
so<00:03:41.670> overall<00:03:42.150> would<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.690> recommend<00:03:43.050> this

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
so overall would I recommend this

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.340 
so overall would I recommend this
absolutely<00:03:44.490> it's<00:03:45.270> really<00:03:45.690> nice<00:03:45.870> because<00:03:46.110> you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
absolutely it's really nice because you

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.280 
absolutely it's really nice because you
don't<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.920> wait<00:03:47.130> on<00:03:47.310> someone<00:03:47.850> to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
don't have to wait on someone to

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.010 
don't have to wait on someone to
jumpstart<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:49.590> come<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:49.890> assist<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.989> a

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
jumpstart you or come and assist it is a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.870 
jumpstart you or come and assist it is a
little<00:03:52.500> bit<00:03:52.620> pricey<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.370> have<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
little bit pricey but if you have the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.810 
little bit pricey but if you have the
money<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.150> would<00:03:54.450> certainly<00:03:55.050> recommend<00:03:55.440> it

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
money I would certainly recommend it

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.410 
money I would certainly recommend it
