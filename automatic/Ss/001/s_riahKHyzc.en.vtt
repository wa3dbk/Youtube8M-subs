00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 How are you guys and girls here? 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.389
 tesela in a new video of the courses 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.180
 online good asia rose 1 in this 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 case is a small guide for 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.730
 explain how to stop turning them 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.009
 are how to stop being a vampire in a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.829
 occasion already in another video teach me how 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.199
 did vampire if you see him in the 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.339
 inventory you can see that my character 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.640
 in the word section 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.579
 can be vampire and we have a series of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.870
 skills are good with some passive ones 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.420
 active and good to say is that you are 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 skills or good this is this this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.730
 vampire conversion can be eliminated 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.530
 because they have their advantages as 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.230
 for example skills as you can see 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.379
 here where we can convert to another 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.969
 person in vampire and increase the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.910
 magic and stamina energy by 10% 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.830
 good at 5% according to skill point 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 that we have or some other things more 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.430
 as for example increase the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.910
 movement speed when we go in 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.790
 crouch or squat in stealth mode 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.310
 to be much faster in 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.230
 stealth good so this kind of 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.120
 situation we can eliminate it because 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.460
 in addition to a change in the aesthetics of 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.310
 our character that you will see when 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.210
 I take off my helmet for example 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.790
 you see here that my character is super 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.150
 super super vampire is that 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.479
 also hipster is is very uncle vampire 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.170
 not then the merit of the matter is that 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.979
 well I will go back to put my dear 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 good hello apart from that story what 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:55.149
 what happens is that our character 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.119
 suffers a series of phases of vampirism 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.850
 ok you see for example that it is in a 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.800
 phase 4 there are four phases as you will see in 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.860
 the good one because in this case the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.460
 75% low life regeneration 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.130
 they inflict 40% more fire damage 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.820
 the vampirism skills this part 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.240
 it's positive it costs 21% less and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.110
 eliminate feeding reduces the stages 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.120
 of vampirism 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.100
 or whether we would gradually reducing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.950
 it's vampirism because we can 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.310
 catch go still in epc 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:36.530
 1 well this is precisely not a 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.980
 example can taking here grace I do not know 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.610
 why 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.860
 you see to use fit newsfeed with like and me 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.900
 could feed in addition to stealing a 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.450
 little bit of sales with update 6 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.480
 could do that good what I'm going 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.989
 so 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.060
 for that there are phases of baptism in which 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.239
 during the first 30 minutes of being 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.750
 infected we have 50 percent of 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.640
 Fire damage that we do the cost in 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.280
 Vampiric reality is reduced in a 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.520
 20 percent then we have a second 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.490
 phase in which for 60 minutes 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:19.319
 it would be that second phase costs 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.240
 it's 20 percent less of him 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.250
 having a vampiric ability 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.540
 the cost of using a vampire skill 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.270
 25% slower the increase of the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.600
 regeneration of life and 50% damage to 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.620
 90 minutes fire health 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.690
 reduces 50 percent speed 50 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.390
 percent year - fire and 40 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.430
 cent of the cost of less than the output 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.020
 of vampiric and then we have one last 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.770
 phase that is the one that I am right now I 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.380
 in which no time limit is not 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.380
 regenerates life 75 percent more 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.760
 slow as you can see on screen 50 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.920
 fire year percent and the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.080
 vampiric pressun skills 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.360
 supposedly reduced by 60 percent 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.120
 hundred the cost although there it puts me that 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.460
 a 21 so well that's some 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.400
 confusion but good the case for 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.690
 reduce or to directly eliminate that 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.989
 we have to go to the wizard's guild 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.680
 it's right here we have to 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.239
 go not far 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.239
 well then we entered the grammy of magicians 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.130
 is in my case as I am in the pact of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.760
 bonham then we are in richter in what 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.800
 Berriz would be worth this region 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.570
 region 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.280
 is right in this area and that's where I've 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.590
 become more pyro where you become 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.830
 in werewolf in the case of being in the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.730
 pact to lower as I say if it were another 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.500
 another other faction because it would be in another 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.910
 side and then here we have people 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.540
 like for example this gentleman 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.830
 from pre latex to venus in this case good 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.950
 it tells us that it can eliminate us by 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.010
 this modest price in the disease of 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.540
 vampirism then nothing bad any 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.520
 way we can say that it is an advantage 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.650
 inconvenience then what do we want 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.660
 we decided that our character does not 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.730
 we want this to have cousin 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.390
 we say yes 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.569
 and then the Lord heals us 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.350
 vampirism in this way 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.140
 Y 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.630
 we are healed of vampirism 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.650
 then we go here have faith see 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.240
 that nothing took off my helmet and we see that 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.000
 my character still has the same 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.730
 vampire factions imagine this 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.500
 that will be removed with time for 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.100
 become the other character is with the 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.409
 previous skin although you see that there is no 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.449
 problem of vampirism and you stay 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.159
 skills will be removed here voucher 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.709
 I understand that if I wanted to go back to 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:02.199
 put vampires would have the 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:04.599
 vampirism and with their abilities that already 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.479
 had that would stay saved but already 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:11.259
 I will inform you on another occasion here 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.599
 my hipster is quietly here with 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.969
 his beloved beard and still with the 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.489
 expression of a vampire but good 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.800
 will be removing as I say and natural 

00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:24.309
 because I wanted to do this you know 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.919
 that my character is a tps 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:29.139
 which damages the damage per second but 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.479
 I also always intend to 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.050
 approach it a bit to whiten it and that 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:38.970
 have for example 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:43.050
 quite an aspect of life that they have 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:45.569
 one more tank initiative because that's 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.979
 what makes my character 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:51.719
 especially receiving damage or bufo from 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.429
 fire for example or reduce the 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:55.800
 regeneration of life and that kind of thing 

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:57.899
 nothing good comes to another type of 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.449
 characters that may come well but 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:03.479
 perhaps you could come best my 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.610
 character would be a werewolf because 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.979
 for the issue of melee damage and 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.529
 others can come a lot better like this 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.569
 that nothing on later occasions 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:14.849
 I will teach that it is from my character 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:17.249
 Become a werewolf and 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.649
 I will calmly teach you 

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:21.240
 in a few upcoming videos in the meantime 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:25.789
 I teach you the last thing I got 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:28.949
 was this rod during a trial of the 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:31.169
 great great and good because it is right now the 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:33.869
 gun better than I have 1,220 of the year 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:35.099
 still as if I say that it was time 

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:37.499
 that is not taking the game and then 

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:40.050
 still shihuang 11 with intent to 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:42.180
 upload them already to 14 of a holy time but 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.459
 Well that will come little by little one 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.279
 file of girls there I leave it I hope that 

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:49.619
 it has served utility in case 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.879
 you are also looking for the same thing and give it 

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:54.259
 a leixóes liked project we like 

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:54.259
 more see you in other videos bye bye
