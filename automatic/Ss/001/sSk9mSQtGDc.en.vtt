with my typical deodorants I always used

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.350 
with my typical deodorants I always used
for<00:00:41.379> spray<00:00:41.649> ones<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.190> after<00:00:42.820> a<00:00:43.059> couple<00:00:43.270> of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
for spray ones and after a couple of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.819 
for spray ones and after a couple of
hours<00:00:43.660> always<00:00:43.899> found<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:44.379> they<00:00:44.590> didn't

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
hours always found that they didn't

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.319 
hours always found that they didn't
really<00:00:44.890> work<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.550> started<00:00:45.850> getting<00:00:45.910> sweaty

really work and I started getting sweaty
and<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.629> bit<00:00:46.780> smelly<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.770> figured<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.340> was

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
and a bit smelly so I figured it was

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.880 
you about sixteen dollars i believe
which<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.120> whole<00:00:55.660> lot<00:00:55.870> i<00:00:56.020> will<00:00:56.230> admit<00:00:56.379> now<00:00:56.649> is

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
which is a whole lot i will admit now is

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.560 
which is a whole lot i will admit now is
a<00:00:56.920> whole<00:00:57.219> lot<00:00:57.430> for<00:00:57.609> deodorant<00:00:57.910> all<00:00:58.210> at<00:00:58.239> once

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
a whole lot for deodorant all at once

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.880 
a whole lot for deodorant all at once
but<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.109> being<00:00:59.289> said<00:00:59.410> this<00:00:59.739> should

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
but with that being said this should

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.709 
but with that being said this should
last<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.309> about<00:01:00.430> three<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:01.000> four<00:01:01.180> months<00:01:01.420> at

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
last you about three to four months at

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.180 
last you about three to four months at
least<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.350> it's<00:01:02.590> definitely<00:01:02.949> something

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
least so it's definitely something

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.680 
least so it's definitely something
that's<00:01:03.399> worth<00:01:03.670> an<00:01:03.820> investment<00:01:04.210> because<00:01:04.420> when

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
that's worth an investment because when

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.510 
that's worth an investment because when
you<00:01:04.809> spend<00:01:05.110> over<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.560> time<00:01:05.800> it's<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:06.280> not

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
you spend over that time it's really not

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.890 
you spend over that time it's really not
that<00:01:06.580> much<00:01:06.910> but<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.270> main<00:01:07.420> reason<00:01:07.450> why<00:01:07.840> I'm

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
that much but the main reason why I'm

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.870 
that much but the main reason why I'm
including<00:01:08.260> this<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.740> because<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.220> works<00:01:09.430> so

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
including this is because it works so

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.270 
including this is because it works so
crazy<00:01:10.479> well<00:01:11.049> I<00:01:11.259> don't<00:01:11.380> know<00:01:11.500> how<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.040> I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
crazy well I don't know how it is I

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.770 
crazy well I don't know how it is I
don't<00:01:12.490> know<00:01:12.610> how<00:01:12.759> they<00:01:12.790> do<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.270> but<00:01:13.299> it<00:01:13.509> stops

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
don't know how they do it but it stops

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.870 
don't know how they do it but it stops
me<00:01:13.960> from<00:01:13.990> sweating<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.710> smelling<00:01:15.220> completely

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
me from sweating and smelling completely

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.789 
me from sweating and smelling completely
the<00:01:16.180> actual<00:01:16.420> formulation<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.320> isn't<00:01:17.500> like

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
the actual formulation of it isn't like

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.350 
the actual formulation of it isn't like
regular<00:01:18.340> role<00:01:18.520> ones<00:01:18.729> where<00:01:18.939> they<00:01:19.090> kind<00:01:19.299> of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
regular role ones where they kind of

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.210 
regular role ones where they kind of
liquidy<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:20.259> actually<00:01:20.590> kind<00:01:20.799> of<00:01:20.860> like<00:01:21.070> a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
liquidy it's actually kind of like a

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.280 
liquidy it's actually kind of like a
moisturizer<00:01:21.579> so<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.450> don't<00:01:22.840> know<00:01:22.960> how<00:01:23.079> that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
formula works and how it doesn't make

sample about that big and I absolutely

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.039 
sample about that big and I absolutely
loved<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.790> I<00:01:42.970> thought<00:01:43.149> it<00:01:43.270> was<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:43.540> great<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.440 
loved it I thought it was so great and
it<00:01:44.140> smells<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:44.680> good<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.670> got<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.030> full<00:01:46.240> size

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it smells so good so I got the full size

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.789 
it smells so good so I got the full size
in<00:01:46.659> them<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:46.990> I've<00:01:47.079> had<00:01:47.229> them<00:01:47.380> for<00:01:47.409> about<00:01:47.619> a

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
in them and I've had them for about a

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.410 
in them and I've had them for about a
month<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.310> they're<00:01:48.490> still<00:01:48.700> pretty<00:01:48.850> well<00:01:49.119> full

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
month and they're still pretty well full

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.120 
month and they're still pretty well full
so<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:50.140> don't<00:01:50.290> really<00:01:50.380> have<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.649> use<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> whole

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
so you don't really have to use a whole

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.770 
so you don't really have to use a whole
lot<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.549> shampoo<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.090> conditioner<00:01:52.600> for

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
lot of this shampoo and conditioner for

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.630 
lot of this shampoo and conditioner for
it<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:53.020> work<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.500> little<00:01:53.710> bit<00:01:53.890> goes<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.130> long<00:01:54.310> way

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
it to work a little bit goes a long way

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.340 
it to work a little bit goes a long way
which<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:55.030> really<00:01:55.210> like<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:55.780> also<00:01:55.899> makes<00:01:56.200> my

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
which I really like it also makes my

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.709 
which I really like it also makes my
hand<00:01:56.590> very<00:01:56.799> shiny<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:57.369> very<00:01:57.670> healthy<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:58.450> I

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
hand very shiny and very healthy so I

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.240 
hand very shiny and very healthy so I
don't<00:01:59.259> know<00:01:59.350> why<00:01:59.619> this<00:01:59.680> one<00:02:00.040> in<00:02:00.159> particular

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
don't know why this one in particular

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.130 
don't know why this one in particular
works<00:02:00.820> because<00:02:01.210> every<00:02:01.509> other<00:02:01.630> healthy

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
works because every other healthy

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.990 
works because every other healthy
shampoo<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.740> I've<00:02:02.860> used<00:02:03.100> really<00:02:03.549> doesn't

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
shampoo that I've used really doesn't

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.060 
shampoo that I've used really doesn't
but<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.539> one<00:02:04.719> works<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.259> well<00:02:05.289> that's<00:02:05.920> for

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
but this one works so well that's for

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.529 
but this one works so well that's for
the<00:02:06.159> small<00:02:06.399> of<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.759> smells<00:02:06.909> like<00:02:07.149> green

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
the small of it it smells like green

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.420 
the small of it it smells like green
apple<00:02:07.990> which<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.440> doesn't<00:02:08.619> even<00:02:08.830> say<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.280> on

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
apple which it doesn't even say that on

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.010 
apple which it doesn't even say that on
the<00:02:09.520> bottle<00:02:09.820> that<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.060> contains<00:02:10.390> green<00:02:10.690> apple

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
the bottle that it contains green apple

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.630 
the bottle that it contains green apple
but<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.320> literally<00:02:11.590> smells<00:02:11.740> like<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.370> such<00:02:12.610> a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
but it literally smells like it such a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.780 
but it literally smells like it such a
great<00:02:12.790> show<00:02:13.000> improving

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790

wearing it it looks so funny you look

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.309 
wearing it it looks so funny you look
like<00:02:37.579> a<00:02:37.609> ghost<00:02:37.909> or<00:02:38.209> an<00:02:38.390> axe<00:02:38.569> murderer<00:02:38.689> it<00:02:39.140> just

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
like a ghost or an axe murderer it just

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.710 
like a ghost or an axe murderer it just
it<00:02:39.799> looks<00:02:40.040> really<00:02:40.280> creepy<00:02:40.519> but<00:02:40.939> it<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.569> feels

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
it looks really creepy but it just feels

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.509 
it looks really creepy but it just feels
so<00:02:41.989> nice<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.379> your<00:02:42.530> skin<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.010> super<00:02:43.250> hydrating

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
so nice on your skin is super hydrating

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.059 
so nice on your skin is super hydrating
they're<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.209> really<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.689> cleaning<00:02:45.500> mask<00:02:45.739> them

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
they're not really a cleaning mask them

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.460 
they're not really a cleaning mask them
also<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.459> hydrating<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.599> moisturizing<00:02:47.930> mask

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
also a hydrating and moisturizing mask

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.020 
also a hydrating and moisturizing mask
so<00:02:48.829> they're<00:02:49.129> more<00:02:49.250> kind<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.579> each<00:02:49.700> treatment

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
so they're more kind of each treatment

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.119 
so they're more kind of each treatment
rather<00:02:50.480> than<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.870> cleaning<00:02:51.409> kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.709> thing<00:02:51.859> so

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
rather than a cleaning kind of thing so

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.830 
rather than a cleaning kind of thing so
this<00:02:52.250> one<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.639> is<00:02:52.669> the<00:02:52.939> infinite<00:02:53.269> clarity

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840

got<00:03:00.290> mind<00:03:00.500> directly<00:03:00.889> from<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.310> Bella<00:03:01.579> box

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
got mind directly from the Bella box

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.879 
got mind directly from the Bella box
store<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.329> if<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.629> like<00:03:02.840> yours<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.769> get

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
store so if you like yours you can get

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.589

them<00:03:04.010> directly<00:03:04.340> from<00:03:04.579> Bella<00:03:04.849> box<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.329> I<00:03:05.359> think

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
them directly from Bella box and I think

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.970 
them directly from Bella box and I think
they're<00:03:05.689> like<00:03:05.900> eight<00:03:06.109> dollars<00:03:06.500> or<00:03:06.650> something

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
they're like eight dollars or something

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.349 
they're like eight dollars or something
but<00:03:07.189> they're<00:03:07.340> definitely<00:03:07.489> worth<00:03:07.909> it<00:03:08.090> they<00:03:08.239> are

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250

coverage

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
coverage

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.820 
coverage
but<00:04:26.420> your<00:04:26.600> skin<00:04:26.870> looks<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.320> healthy<00:04:27.620> and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
but your skin looks so healthy and

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.920 
but your skin looks so healthy and
glowing<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.760> don't<00:04:29.000> actually<00:04:29.180> need<00:04:29.390> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
glowing that you don't actually need the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.780 
glowing that you don't actually need the
heavier<00:04:30.320> coverage<00:04:30.530> if<00:04:30.890> that<00:04:31.040> makes<00:04:31.250> sense<00:04:31.460> so

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
heavier coverage if that makes sense so

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.220 
heavier coverage if that makes sense so
I<00:04:31.970> don't<00:04:32.150> know<00:04:32.210> why<00:04:32.420> but<00:04:32.450> it<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:32.750> makes<00:04:33.110> your
