 to say that I can not be happy 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.919
 the reason is very simple 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.350
 maybe I did not have an appointment with me to 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.720
 to confirm it 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.070

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.220
 term that we do not even want me 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.510
 which were yours 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.370
 as we are used to each 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.560
 when every make a new video game

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.540
 while of agonists good data and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.750
 as you want to tell everyone and it's what 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.490
 we are talking about the same moron 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.610

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.610
 pikachu new clothes not because it's not a 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.300
 new region called the carlos region 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.410
 the end of those arizona 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.790
 the series starts very basic are you 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.460
 explanation a plane going to the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.890
 heat region is then the plane 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.140
 lands at the airport helps the air 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.550
 just get off the plane and he finds 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.260
 a pokemon goal is that he does not know 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.480
 because they are the new pokémons the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.330
 new generations and this puts it very 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.970
 happy to the degree that it whips dry in the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.290
 something immense plane whips the secret I know 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.540
 that by the stairs in a very 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.520
 comical simply for so was his 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.320
 surprise to see the new pokémon that 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.260
 without help from the qualities to soto lares 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.180
 like who says 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.040
 after that a girl who was 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.670
 accompanying was something like your guide or 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.790
 something like that 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.500
 Well, it's going to be a call to a sister 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.680
 that are the gym head that is in 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.050
 another city and to be left to fight 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.420
 Then he stays and waits for her 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.489
 the airport and out of nowhere behind the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.739
 pair is a mysterious pokémon like style 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.690
 ninja because you can not see her face or anything 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.820
 only the pokemon is shaded 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.620
 jump over it and it was a 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.720
 disappears like a child 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.580
 obviously this pokemon is undeniable and 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.290
 follow the mega evolution of blades and 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.610
 qing and tong 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.610
 the game that we all know 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.620
 after this strange meeting 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.410
 Dreizik in the gym with me that 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.240
 city ​​and it turns out that they reject it 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.930
 because to enter the gym and challenge 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.580
 to the king and challenge to exercise at the gym 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.620
 You need to have at least four medals and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.080
 he does not have them so he is rejected by him 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.760
 it indicates its flying out and that's when 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.380
 known 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.150
 since when he met yurika townhouses 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.940
 it is in this part that he meets the 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.010
 boys who are iunika and her older brother 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.300
 that did not improve work and locate are the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.639
 Chiquita girls 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.470
 a girl as no older than my sister 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.020
 so to speak and the other is a guy from 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.830
 the same age as a nerd beggar with 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.960
 a backpack that is a good backpack is 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.039
 you can as an invention that is 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.960
 as an invention because it has an arm 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.849
 mechanical and all that is half rare is a 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.970
 beggar jr of those who already have us 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.970
 fed up 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.740
 I do not know what the fuck that was done for but 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.740
 I did it 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.689
 and apart from all that it turns out that classic 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.819
 in the first chapter the team appears 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.749
 red trying to kidnap pikachu 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.009
 to the pokemones of these guys and then 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:53.859
 pokémon appears a frog called 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.899
 Quero Matsu and he saves it but never 

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:57.099
 ends very badly hurt so they have 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:00.309
 than taking it to the doctor in that region 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.619
 that is a teacher is like the teacher 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:06.149
 but younger is he who explains them 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.149
 about the half evolutions and all that 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.479
 In short, the reason why this series 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.780
 liked much more than the previous ones is a 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.940
 moon warning and is a girl it turns out that 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.250
 there is a girl called sand call 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.100
 that seems in the past with our 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.889
 protagonists is a girl like this 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.210
 pretty pretty heroin rare more 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.699
 beautiful that I see her because mona is 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.440
 elaborated and it seems that it has happened with 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.510
 wings because as you know it the network 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.250
 rather he recognizes it and there is a scene 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.280
 where you see this little one and her 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.990
 together good not together is true is the 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.250
 idea that they had known each other for 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.289
 many years and now they are going to rediscover 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.979
 in this new series 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.240
 and it's pretty in like romantic a little 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.919
 weird but what I liked most about the 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.869
 series because now there is a lot of history 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.059
 behind the characters if not so much a 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:53.979
 pokémon and battle but such and that there 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.560
 a lot of history and that's what they see in 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.990
 Staff is what I liked the most 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.550
 In short, if I had to choose which of 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.910
 I liked the two more, I would say that I liked it 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.639
 more xy pokemon that I liked a lot because 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.730
 already gave the story of a turn a turn 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.440
 HUGE and white grade very 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.930
 promising the series so far 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.800
 that only takes two chapters and I'll see 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.800
 Chapter 3 Saturday 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.370
 that's all if they liked it like up 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.210
 handy bitch 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.860
 of the manita quite light and comment 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.320
 anything if it became a detail 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.650
 of the new series that's all 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.650
 faith
