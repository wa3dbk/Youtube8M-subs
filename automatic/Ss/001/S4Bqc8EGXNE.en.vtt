00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:14.919 
it and it seems to work out really well

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.329 
it and it seems to work out really well
it's<00:00:15.919> pretty<00:00:16.219> accurate<00:00:17.560> scope<00:00:18.560> scope<00:00:19.130> is

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339

I<00:00:20.929> mean<00:00:21.230> it's<00:00:21.560> expensive<00:00:21.890> scope<00:00:22.369> but<00:00:23.060> I<00:00:23.119> just

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
I mean it's expensive scope but I just

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.509 
I mean it's expensive scope but I just
thought<00:00:23.419> I'd<00:00:23.599> try<00:00:23.749> it<00:00:23.839> out<00:00:24.080> on<00:00:24.109> this<00:00:24.980> air<00:00:25.189> rifle
