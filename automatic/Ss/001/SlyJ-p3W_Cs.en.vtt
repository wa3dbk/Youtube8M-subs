00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.680 
be looking looks like there's some sort
of<00:05:35.610> party<00:05:36.509> going

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:06:06.760 

so<00:05:39.690> can<00:05:39.930> find<00:05:40.199> that<00:05:40.759> snake

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.290 

so<00:06:07.770> the<00:06:07.890> snake<00:06:08.130> should<00:06:09.030> pop<00:06:09.240> up<00:06:09.270> around<00:06:09.720> here

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
so the snake should pop up around here

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.300 
so the snake should pop up around here
but<00:06:12.300> it<00:06:12.390> might<00:06:12.630> take<00:06:12.960> a<00:06:12.990> few<00:06:13.140> times<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:14.040> find

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
but it might take a few times to find

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.860 
but it might take a few times to find
him<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:15.300> Python<00:06:15.860> let's<00:06:16.860> see<00:06:17.310> maybe<00:06:18.300> if<00:06:18.540> we<00:06:18.690> go

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
him the Python let's see maybe if we go

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:35.750 
him the Python let's see maybe if we go
