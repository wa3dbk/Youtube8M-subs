00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.890
 anselmo basket I see that the creampie 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.870
 that I put you for those burns that you 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.969
 you did fortuitously to zero you will not have 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.549
 out there some coconut to hydrate me 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.549
 the lips so that if I have it here 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.590
 in contrast to the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.829
 good is that it passes trinh zeros and first 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.879
 welcome to coffee with coffee I do not know 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.239
 how many of 365 holiday status 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.010
 relatively because he's doing 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.930
 projects that I had to do 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.180
 and hey, he has left these bosses a little 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.550
 but now I come back with marking like this in more 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.470
 force that in ever in the final stretch of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.899
 this annual project that is coffee with what 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.000
 that ends on September 17 and how 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.790
 I will do to finish on September 10 with 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.890
 the videos that you need then I will not go 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.320
 going up some day 2 some day 3 some 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 day 25 coffees provided on the date 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 right and we are during this time 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.350
 been looking good has pulled me away 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.580
 quite a lot of twitter and facebook that 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.350
 anything that is virtual and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 medicated live a thing I do not know if 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.580
 you know that it's called the real world and that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.070
 it's pretty funny because things 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.350
 they have an even greater interactivity than 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.509
 on the internet or two things that you touch 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 and palpa yes good is a brutality what 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.490
 I recommend 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.920
 really try the real world 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.090
 even if it's only a couple of weeks in 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.649
 these days I have chosen the environment a bit 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.200
 on YouTube to see how things were 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.579
 as such and I have seen that many people ask 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.439
 much quality in the videos quality 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.450
 flat hey we listen more videos upload 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.340
 the quality of the videos such and such 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.469
 in the videos of youtube espaÃ±a is like 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.450
 asking a nun to suck you well is 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.399
 something that good can happen but without 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.380
 doubt is something exceptional something is a 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.450
 pleasant surprise a rare avis an ex aequo 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.280
 well you understand me is not the best 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 usual but that has made me think of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.149
 these days that been like a scratching 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.710
 of the balls with a fruition in order 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.030
 who are going to write songs about 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.460
 how hard it is for me to touch these eggs 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.319
 days apart I was recording things with 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.579
 people that make me laugh increases the 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.439
 I think that what they do is 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.810
 quality so the following days 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.360
 apart from some loose coffee catch mine 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.640
 I 'm going to put you every afternoon at 6 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.200
 a coffee with a guest who has been 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.239
 for my house and we've done some kind 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.709
 of thing that I find very cool people who 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.390
 I think you have to know and that 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.579
 some will surely know them from 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.790
 Too many people, in short, I think that 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.620
 does youtube quality or at least a 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.050
 youtube that entertains me and makes me 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.670
 laugh from 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.170
 I'm not drinking anything but what 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.460
 enjoy that people who pass by 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.380
 here for coffee so many weeks that it's 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.150
 recording these days please you are 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.250
 people that that really has makes me 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.250
 laugh see you soon 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.330
 if I say goodbye like this from now on there's 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.610
 something like the written or 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.500
 dismissed if always from the coffees or what 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:57.870
 we can turn into an agent 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.870
 say goodbye to your soul friend like that 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.790
 We can take it anywhere if 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.790
 we want 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.270

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.930
