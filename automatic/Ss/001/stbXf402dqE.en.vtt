 ana miranda metiésemos appealed to the seriousness that they have been carrying out 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.830

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.550

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.470

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 paternity 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.560
 in this way 7% winds from 10 to 11 kilometers per hour 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.710
 and pressure bp indicated that the chain be also for these next three 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.230
 days belong to the same meta section, it goes down a little compared to the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.289
 what do we have right now? 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.059

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 specific in terms of sales 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.379
 but for the hours of the afternoon for the daytime hours we have values 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.949
 of 32 of the 33,500 to 15 to 17 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.040
 and there they have their majority clear and that without ruling out the increase in 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.410
 winds another way of doing criticism this month and good especially since the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.580
 pretty enough intendant climate and that cheap solar radiation 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.180
 In addition they will take proper precautions sunscreen lotion 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.810

 ipad good 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.450
 already happened here it works to establish the opposite part also 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.150
 It allows to give many joys as they participate, they must be amandita more 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.030

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.779
 Today will be the top especially for many who celebrate 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.919

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.579

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.079
 they are throwing cheek, yes, yes, the camping 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.819
 weather forecast have to have a current Monaco blanket 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.480
 from 29 to 32 'we have a humidity factor of 5 to 6 percent winds 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.149
 from 10 to 11 kilometers per hour by the press did not keep calm 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.619
 and that after so much pressure practically hits the street 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.860
 for these lagoon flushes 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.320
 We are experimenting since today so we are so for the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.610
 next three days that is not treating you issues 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.260
 can this forecast from 32 to 33 and today is very 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.709
 hot 30 degrees 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.040
 vanoc games of 30 32 of what we have estimated for the coming days of the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.519
 15 at 19 will be the minimum thermometer that we expect experienced such was the 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.650
 today's case 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.780
 where it was clear it will also be doing its own and well for 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.120
 this spring that almost almost to start 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.200
 because they are up to 50 degrees and last year we had a thermometer 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.809
 maximum of 48 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.249
 now it is expected that 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:20.539
 we reach 50 degrees centigrade and they are advancing moposita what is going to 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.239
 move to most of the national territory still exists and more with this 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.759
 anticyclonic system that continues to favor 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.909
 skies widely cleared 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.010
 yes to very sunny Mormons compared to other days where 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.869
 we had experienced colder cold temperatures 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:40.019
 more unstable that we do not know if it's going to be cloudy sunny and I see that 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.080
 delve into these cold conditions 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 now for the moment the weather remains fairly uniform most 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.249
 north-north-east center of the country in the south 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.859
 is where we have this forecast of more rain temperate climate a little bit 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:52.900
 nicer 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.409
 and well 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.319
 those who are planning their next vacation 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.399

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:04.339
 better than ever so good let's see what you're not going to be also for 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.749
 the surrounding localities 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.689
 such is the case of chihuahua where the maximum oscillates 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.099
 of the 22 of the 23 the minimum of the ten of the eleven for maximum zacatecas 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.180
 from twenty-seven to 28 for san luis 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.469
 it is already in the sky widely cleared 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:22.549
 and good also where we have a pretty happy weather this booth and 

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:26.299
 Well, it's pretty shameful in Saltillo to Monterrey in Durango. 

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.499
 Remember that the humidity factor in what favors you feels a bit more 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:34.139
 warm the atmosphere more steam or are the maximum will be the 28 and the 30 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.849
 degrees Celsius and well were minimal from 11 to 15 with this 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.589
 partial cloudiness that you want and already know in the course of the morning and the 

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:45.550
 night we have presence of clouds in the afternoon dissipate giving foot to that 

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:49.559
 Mostly clear sky so practically very hot but then 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.549

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:53.409
 hoppers 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.119
 and both here and in torreón in saltillo in monterrey are going to present 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.259
 because of these increases in winds and the mouth may come out because they can 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.219
 allow so good let's see what happens for mexico guadalajara 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.990
 and macará will give us the maximum will be from 24 to 27 'the minimum will be 

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:14.319
 the thirteen to the 16 with this new partial closure that what happens with the phase 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.300
 lunar today we have a percentage of lighting then 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.800
 considers 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.210

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.960
