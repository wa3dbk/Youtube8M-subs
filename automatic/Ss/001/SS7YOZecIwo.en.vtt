this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> pretty<00:02:05.280> dark<00:02:05.640> episode<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.210> do

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this is a pretty dark episode but I do

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.930 
this is a pretty dark episode but I do
have<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.689> say<00:02:06.780> one<00:02:07.350> thing<00:02:07.680> about<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.550> stockmen

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
have to say one thing about the stockmen

at<00:02:10.390> least<00:02:11.050> his<00:02:11.680> vision<00:02:12.250> was<00:02:12.280> corrected<00:02:12.910> I

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
at least his vision was corrected I

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.360 
at least his vision was corrected I
maybe<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:14.260> one<00:02:14.500> silver<00:02:14.770> lining<00:02:14.890> about

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
maybe there's one silver lining about

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.310 
maybe there's one silver lining about
that<00:02:15.610> mutation<00:02:16.260> his<00:02:17.260> vision<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> way<00:02:20.080> is

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
that mutation his vision is a way is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.740 
that mutation his vision is a way is
like<00:02:20.590> way<00:02:21.160> better<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.940> know<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.510> better

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
like way better you know like we better

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.690 
like way better you know like we better
because<00:02:23.020> he's<00:02:23.140> got<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> bunch<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.740> ice<00:02:23.890> plus

he's<00:02:25.330> also<00:02:25.630> he<00:02:26.260> also<00:02:26.680> has<00:02:27.010> super<00:02:27.820> hearing<00:02:27.850> so

he's also he also has super hearing so
those<00:02:29.860> out<00:02:30.130> finds<00:02:30.550> its<00:02:30.670> hurdles<00:02:30.970> finds<00:02:31.240> out

those out finds its hurdles finds out

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.110 
those out finds its hurdles finds out
about<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.600> retro-mutagen<00:02:31.960> he<00:02:32.880> captures<00:02:33.880> you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
about the retro-mutagen he captures you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.270 
about the retro-mutagen he captures you
know<00:02:34.270> he<00:02:34.480> threatens<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.320> capture<00:02:35.680> April<00:02:36.100> and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
know he threatens to capture April and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.730 
know he threatens to capture April and
he<00:02:36.880> actually<00:02:37.030> does<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.600> after<00:02:38.080> figuring<00:02:38.350> out

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
he actually does it after figuring out

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.030 
he actually does it after figuring out
that<00:02:39.010> maybe<00:02:39.460> if<00:02:39.930> he<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.140> mutate<00:02:41.560> himself

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that maybe if he can mutate himself

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.520 
that maybe if he can mutate himself
along<00:02:42.280> with<00:02:42.310> April<00:02:43.000> they<00:02:43.330> will<00:02:43.510> merge<00:02:43.870> he<00:02:44.410> will

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
along with April they will merge he will

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.590 
along with April they will merge he will
become<00:02:44.830> human<00:02:45.250> again<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.700> stronger<00:02:46.360> that's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
become human again and stronger that's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.130 
become human again and stronger that's
his<00:02:46.870> that's<00:02:47.500> his<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> flawed<00:02:48.610> plan<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:52.140> now

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
his that's his a flawed plan and and now

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.310 
his that's his a flawed plan and and now
they<00:02:53.770> gotta<00:02:54.010> scramble<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.880> make<00:02:55.510> more<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
they gotta scramble and make more you

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.410 
they gotta scramble and make more you
know<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.590> try<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.830> make<00:02:57.010> more<00:02:57.430> mutagen<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:58.090> top

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
know and try to make more mutagen on top

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.800 
know and try to make more mutagen on top
of<00:02:58.890> trying<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.160> get<00:03:00.910> April's<00:03:01.300> debt<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.690> know

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
of trying to get April's debt you know

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.780 
of trying to get April's debt you know
did<00:03:02.110> April<00:03:02.410> dad<00:03:02.620> turn<00:03:02.950> back<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.670> turn

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
did April dad turn back in here and turn

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.790 
did April dad turn back in here and turn
back<00:03:04.060> into<00:03:04.180> human<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.870> turns<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.770> a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
back into human so it turns on to a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.240 
back into human so it turns on to a
whole<00:03:06.190> freakin<00:03:06.700> chase<00:03:07.360> now<00:03:08.170> April<00:03:08.830> has<00:03:09.010> been

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
whole freakin chase now April has been

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.170 
whole freakin chase now April has been
captured<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.870> know<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:12.120> didn't<00:03:13.120> think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
captured you know and I didn't think

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.880 
captured you know and I didn't think
they<00:03:13.300> were<00:03:13.390> going<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.570> go<00:03:13.750> there<00:03:14.019> but<00:03:14.380> she

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
they were going to go there but she

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.070 
they were going to go there but she
actually<00:03:15.040> falls<00:03:15.519> into<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.480> giant<00:03:16.840> vat<00:03:17.050> of

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
actually falls into the giant vat of

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.229 
actually falls into the giant vat of
mutagen<00:03:17.680> after<00:03:17.950> being<00:03:18.160> tied<00:03:18.459> up<00:03:18.489> she<00:03:19.060> almost

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
mutagen after being tied up she almost

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.310 
mutagen after being tied up she almost
gets<00:03:19.540> away<00:03:19.769> but<00:03:20.769> she<00:03:21.459> falls<00:03:21.790> into<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:23.200> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
gets away but she falls into the to the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.560 
gets away but she falls into the to the
giant<00:03:23.920> vat<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.130> mutagen<00:03:24.670> when<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.239> turtles

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
giant vat of mutagen when the turtles

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.850 
giant vat of mutagen when the turtles
are<00:03:25.660> coming<00:03:25.900> when<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.290> turtles<00:03:26.560> are<00:03:26.650> coming

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
are coming when the turtles are coming

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.830 
are coming when the turtles are coming
to<00:03:26.920> rescue<00:03:27.100> her<00:03:27.370> turns<00:03:28.000> out<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.570> this<00:03:28.600> is

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
to rescue her turns out and this is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.690 
to rescue her turns out and this is
something<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.470> thought<00:03:30.310> about<00:03:30.459> before

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
something that I thought about before

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.729 
something that I thought about before
I'm<00:03:30.970> like<00:03:31.000> what<00:03:31.630> else<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:32.050> they<00:03:32.200> do<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.440> mean

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
I'm like what else can they do I mean

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.330 
I'm like what else can they do I mean
she's<00:03:32.980> already<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.580> mutant<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:36.040> know<00:03:36.160> she's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
she's already a mutant you know she's

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.190 
she's already a mutant you know she's
already<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:37.950> naturally<00:03:38.950> born<00:03:39.570> mutant<00:03:40.570> so<00:03:40.989> what

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
already a naturally born mutant so what

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.930 
already a naturally born mutant so what
are<00:03:41.230> they<00:03:41.440> going<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.680> do<00:03:41.800> or<00:03:41.980> her<00:03:42.610> cell<00:03:42.910> is

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
are they going to do or her cell is

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.729 
are they going to do or her cell is
gonna<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.570> know<00:03:43.690> going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.959> accelerating

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
gonna you know going to accelerating

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.940 
gonna you know going to accelerating
mutate<00:03:45.190> much<00:03:45.730> like<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.989> know<00:03:47.110> much<00:03:47.500> like<00:03:47.769> what

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
mutate much like you know much like what

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.280 
mutate much like you know much like what
happened<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> Roz<00:03:48.640> are<00:03:48.880> where<00:03:49.360> he<00:03:49.600> mutated<00:03:50.080> in

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
happened to Roz are where he mutated in

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.710 
happened to Roz are where he mutated in
where<00:03:50.440> he<00:03:50.530> basically<00:03:50.920> he<00:03:51.670> got<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> mutation<00:03:52.540> on

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
where he basically he got a mutation on

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.370 
where he basically he got a mutation on
top<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.080> an<00:03:53.200> already<00:03:53.459> mutated<00:03:54.459> human<00:03:55.150> no<00:03:55.930> she's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
top of an already mutated human no she's

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.229 
top of an already mutated human no she's
immune<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:56.980> makes<00:03:57.400> perfect<00:03:57.580> sense<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.120> me

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
immune to it makes perfect sense to me

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.080 
immune to it makes perfect sense to me
you<00:03:58.600> know<00:03:58.720> that's<00:03:59.380> why<00:03:59.680> her<00:03:59.980> DNA<00:04:00.400> work<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.850> make

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
you know that's why her DNA work to make

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.810 
you know that's why her DNA work to make
the<00:04:01.269> retro-mutagen<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.470> now<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.370> chase

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
the retro-mutagen so now it is a chase

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.880 
the retro-mutagen so now it is a chase
to<00:04:04.269> keep<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:04.720> retro-mutagen<00:04:05.200> out<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.830> the
