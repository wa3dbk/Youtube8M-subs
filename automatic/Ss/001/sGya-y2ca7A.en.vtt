00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.720
 that creates opportunities you have to be 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.140
 present as the second balloons and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.229
 then bobby in attack that we can create 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.040
 breccias and innovation 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.610
 unfortunately ouzou is not very 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.759
 nice shot and that's why not you did 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.030
 not marked it's finally we make 1 0 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.899
 for a first game she did a good 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.850
 beginning 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.799
 we came to play we came to 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.729
 win so you had to score that goal 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.090
 who could give us the victory 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.630
 something we know well that we have 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.470
 realized 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.310
 in how much halfway to the basics he 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.140
 had to win here is the win selection 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.360
 the game 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.190
 vote not important key matches 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.730
 the bottom line is the win listening 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.360
 overall the meeting 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.900
 almost to more or less well played 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.240
 so in history I hope that the 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.070
 meeting will win seven 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.230

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
 what in the whole mauritian played well 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.680

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.920

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.920
