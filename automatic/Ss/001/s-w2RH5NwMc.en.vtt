will do mine is a mechanical pencil the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.790 
will do mine is a mechanical pencil the
first<00:00:21.220> thing<00:00:21.400> you<00:00:21.520> want<00:00:21.700> to<00:00:21.790> draw<00:00:22.060> is<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:23.500> heel

first thing you want to draw is a heel

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.030 
first thing you want to draw is a heel
for<00:00:26.800> your<00:00:26.980> house<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.369> sit<00:00:27.610> on<00:00:27.899> then<00:00:29.040> you're

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
for your house to sit on then you're

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.030 
for your house to sit on then you're
going<00:00:30.189> to<00:00:30.279> draw<00:00:30.550> a<00:00:30.880> square<00:00:31.809> on<00:00:32.290> your<00:00:32.500> heel<00:00:32.770> but

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
going to draw a square on your heel but

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.650 
going to draw a square on your heel but
it's<00:00:33.190> going<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.430> be<00:00:33.550> wider<00:00:33.820> at<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.059> top<00:00:34.180> and

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
it's going to be wider at the top and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.319 
it's going to be wider at the top and
smaller<00:00:35.590> at<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.890> bottom<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:36.760> it's<00:00:36.880> not<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.059> real

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
smaller at the bottom so it's not a real

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.440 
smaller at the bottom so it's not a real
square<00:00:37.719> on<00:00:38.850> top<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.090> you're<00:00:40.270> going<00:00:40.420> to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
square on top of that you're going to

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.690 
square on top of that you're going to
put<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.780> roof<00:00:40.990> which<00:00:41.680> is<00:00:41.860> going<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.100> be<00:00:42.400> it's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
put the roof which is going to be it's

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.160 
put the roof which is going to be it's
going<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.030> hang<00:00:43.240> out<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.420> little<00:00:43.690> bit<00:00:43.900> on<00:00:44.020> each

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
going to hang out a little bit on each

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.430 
going to hang out a little bit on each
side<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.920> square<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.520> then<00:00:46.450> curve<00:00:47.440> up<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
side of the square and then curve up and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.590 
side of the square and then curve up and
curve<00:00:50.440> back<00:00:50.680> down<00:00:50.860> on<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.160> other<00:00:51.250> side<00:00:51.600> after

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
curve back down on the other side after

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400 
curve back down on the other side after
you<00:00:52.660> go<00:00:52.810> across<00:00:53.140> so<00:00:54.100> it's<00:00:54.250> kind<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.520> another

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you go across so it's kind of another

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.140 
you go across so it's kind of another
rectangle<00:00:56.410> shape<00:00:56.590> but<00:00:56.800> it's<00:00:56.950> not<00:00:57.850> quite<00:00:58.120> a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
rectangle shape but it's not quite a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.229 
rectangle shape but it's not quite a
rectangle<00:00:58.750> then<00:00:59.470> we're<00:00:59.650> going<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.829> do<00:00:59.950> another

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
rectangle then we're going to do another

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.180 
rectangle then we're going to do another
square<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.750> wider<00:01:02.260> at<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.560> top<00:01:02.620> and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
square that is wider at the top and

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.440 
square that is wider at the top and
smaller<00:01:03.640> at<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.880> bottom<00:01:04.329> and<00:01:05.490> another<00:01:06.490> long

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
smaller at the bottom and another long

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.210 
smaller at the bottom and another long
rectangle<00:01:07.990> just<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.320> this<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.710> top<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:09.070> this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
rectangle just like this on top of this

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.180 
rectangle just like this on top of this
that<00:01:09.490> sticks<00:01:09.820> out<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:10.000> little<00:01:10.240> on<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.570> sides

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
that sticks out a little on the sides

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.740 
that sticks out a little on the sides
comes<00:01:12.190> up<00:01:12.430> across<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.740> together<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.659> we

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
comes up across down and together so we

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.020 
comes up across down and together so we
have<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:16.900> basic<00:01:17.530> part<00:01:18.370> of<00:01:18.430> our<00:01:18.550> haunted<00:01:18.729> house

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
have a basic part of our haunted house

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.820 
have a basic part of our haunted house
this<00:01:19.870> haunted<00:01:20.200> house<00:01:20.290> we're<00:01:20.470> going<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.650> put<00:01:20.800> a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
this haunted house we're going to put a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.550 
this haunted house we're going to put a
big<00:01:21.040> Tower<00:01:21.280> on<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.790> side<00:01:22.000> up<00:01:22.180> here<00:01:22.260> I'm<00:01:23.260> going

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
big Tower on the side up here I'm going

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.860 
big Tower on the side up here I'm going
to<00:01:23.620> be<00:01:23.740> behind<00:01:24.159> this<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.400> little<00:01:24.640> bit<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.150> it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
to be behind this a little bit so it's

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.600 
to be behind this a little bit so it's
going<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.140> come<00:01:26.320> up<00:01:26.560> right<00:01:26.799> here<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.370> it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
going to come up right here and it's

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.660 
going to come up right here and it's
going<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.850> be<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.030> giant<00:01:28.450> rectangle<00:01:29.370> that<00:01:30.370> sort

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
going to be a giant rectangle that sort

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.860 
going to be a giant rectangle that sort
of<00:01:30.760> curves<00:01:31.060> in<00:01:31.299> -<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:33.100> our<00:01:33.310> Tower<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:34.030> on

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
of curves in - there's our Tower and on

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.149 
of curves in - there's our Tower and on
top<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.320> we're<00:01:35.500> going<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.650> put<00:01:35.860> another

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
top of that we're going to put another

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.170 
top of that we're going to put another
roof<00:01:36.460> piece<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:37.330> curves<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:37.930> comes<00:01:38.680> across

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
roof piece that curves up comes across

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.260 
roof piece that curves up comes across
curves<00:01:40.180> down<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.580> we've<00:01:42.700> got<00:01:42.850> our<00:01:42.970> basic

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
curves down so we've got our basic

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.300 
curves down so we've got our basic
framework<00:01:44.140> for<00:01:44.170> our<00:01:44.530> haunted<00:01:44.740> house<00:01:45.010> now<00:01:45.250> we

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
framework for our haunted house now we

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.539 
framework for our haunted house now we
just<00:01:45.610> need<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.850> add<00:01:46.030> some<00:01:46.710> details<00:01:47.710> let's<00:01:48.430> go

just need to add some details let's go
ahead<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.000> add<00:01:49.150> a<00:01:49.180> chimney<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.400> a

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
ahead and add a chimney it's just a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.300 
ahead and add a chimney it's just a
rectangle<00:01:52.090> up<00:01:52.869> there<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.560> can<00:01:53.710> do<00:01:53.799> another<00:01:54.070> one

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
rectangle up there we can do another one

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.910 
rectangle up there we can do another one
over<00:01:54.610> here<00:01:54.640> if<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:56.020> want<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.409> put<00:01:56.560> smoke

over here if you want to put smoke

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.219 
over here if you want to put smoke
coming<00:01:57.280> out<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.430> your<00:01:57.640> chimneys<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.689> can<00:01:58.990> I

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
coming out of your chimneys you can I

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
coming out of your chimneys you can I
just<00:01:59.439> do<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.710> with<00:01:59.920> squiggle<00:02:00.400> lines<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
just do that with squiggle lines and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.340 
just do that with squiggle lines and
we're<00:02:04.360> going<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.540> want<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.780> add<00:02:04.900> our<00:02:05.080> front

going on this hill

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.460 
going on this hill
we'll<00:05:14.400> do<00:05:14.580> some<00:05:17.810> ridges<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:19.110> like<00:05:19.259> that

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
we'll do some ridges that go like that

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.469 
we'll do some ridges that go like that
might<00:05:20.009> look<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.340> little<00:05:20.580> spider<00:05:20.820> webby<00:05:21.180> and

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
might look a little spider webby and

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.070 
might look a little spider webby and
some<00:05:22.440> straight<00:05:22.830> lines<00:05:23.070> if<00:05:23.400> you<00:05:23.460> want<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.820> do

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
some straight lines if you want to do

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.070 
some straight lines if you want to do
ridges<00:05:25.080> all<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.650> way<00:05:25.770> down<00:05:25.979> like<00:05:26.009> that<00:05:26.460> you

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
ridges all the way down like that you

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.219 
ridges all the way down like that you
can<00:05:28.080> I'm<00:05:28.380> going<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.650> put<00:05:28.800> triangles<00:05:29.310> on<00:05:29.430> top<00:05:30.229> so

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
can I'm going to put triangles on top so

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.390 
can I'm going to put triangles on top so
it<00:05:31.260> looks<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.710> little<00:05:31.830> bit<00:05:32.099> scary<00:05:34.130> I'm<00:05:35.130> going<00:05:35.310> to
