outside is wet damp or you fall into a
lake<00:01:03.579> or<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.789> river<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:04.689> can't<00:01:04.930> use<00:01:05.140> your

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
lake or a river and you can't use your

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.450 
lake or a river and you can't use your
cigarette<00:01:05.650> lighter<00:01:05.680> or<00:01:05.950> matches<00:01:06.159> because

cigarette lighter or matches because

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.310 
cigarette lighter or matches because
they're<00:01:06.760> soaking<00:01:07.000> wet<00:01:07.299> well<00:01:08.049> then<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.260> is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
they're soaking wet well then this is

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.560 
they're soaking wet well then this is
where<00:01:08.470> your<00:01:08.619> magnesium<00:01:08.950> comes<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:10.510> a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
where your magnesium comes in it's a

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.210 
where your magnesium comes in it's a
very<00:01:10.750> soft<00:01:10.990> magnesium<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.830> scrapes<00:01:12.070> off

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
very soft magnesium so it scrapes off

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.490 
very soft magnesium so it scrapes off
very<00:01:12.430> easily<00:01:12.930> however<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:14.080> don't<00:01:14.110> have<00:01:14.380> to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
very easily however you don't have to

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.170 
very easily however you don't have to
worry<00:01:14.680> about<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.920> magnesium<00:01:15.340> igniting<00:01:15.970> in<00:01:16.090> a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
worry about the magnesium igniting in a

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.670 
worry about the magnesium igniting in a
solid<00:01:16.509> form<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:16.990> if<00:01:17.080> this<00:01:17.229> falls<00:01:17.409> into<00:01:17.590> your

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
solid form so if this falls into your

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.170 
solid form so if this falls into your
campfire<00:01:18.100> your<00:01:18.490> barbecue<00:01:18.880> pit<00:01:19.060> of<00:01:19.150> your

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
campfire your barbecue pit of your

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.880 
campfire your barbecue pit of your
fireplace<00:01:19.570> just<00:01:20.200> go<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.350> pull<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.619> right<00:01:20.710> back

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
fireplace just go and pull it right back

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.640 
fireplace just go and pull it right back
out<00:01:21.100> again<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:22.659> using<00:01:22.689> the<00:01:22.960> hacksaw<00:01:23.350> blade

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
out again I'm using the hacksaw blade

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.380 
out again I'm using the hacksaw blade
which<00:01:23.860> they<00:01:24.040> all<00:01:24.159> come<00:01:24.430> with<00:01:24.460> but<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.270> use
