table<00:00:50.660> very<00:00:50.870> early<00:00:51.110> on<00:00:51.730> hopefully<00:00:52.730> we'll<00:00:52.880> get

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
table very early on hopefully we'll get

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.760 
table very early on hopefully we'll get
in<00:00:53.090> quite<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:53.300> few<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.780> think<00:00:54.170> this<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.410> just<00:00:54.440> a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
in quite a few I think this is just a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.670 
in quite a few I think this is just a
just<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:55.399> value<00:00:55.700> shove<00:00:55.910> I<00:00:56.420> think<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.290> only<00:00:57.410> hand

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
just a value shove I think the only hand

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.680 
just a value shove I think the only hand
actually<00:00:57.920> beats<00:00:58.250> at<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:58.489> point<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.149> 5x

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
actually beats at this point is like 5x

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.380 
actually beats at this point is like 5x
of<00:00:59.870> clubs<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:00.500> think<00:01:01.040> he's<00:01:01.160> got<00:01:01.280> worse<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.970> sex

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
of clubs I think he's got worse I a sex

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.389 
of clubs I think he's got worse I a sex
the<00:01:02.750> vast<00:01:02.930> majority<00:01:03.050> which<00:01:03.770> he<00:01:03.920> just<00:01:04.129> he<00:01:04.369> just

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
the vast majority which he just he just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.010 
the vast majority which he just he just
never<00:01:04.699> falls<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:05.239> he<00:01:05.329> gets<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.659> river<00:01:05.899> with

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
never falls if he gets to the river with

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.620 
never falls if he gets to the river with
it<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.680> i<00:01:06.710> think<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:07.969> a<00:01:08.299> value

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
it so i think it's it's just a value

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.899 
it so i think it's it's just a value
ship<00:01:08.870> a<00:01:09.560> hundred<00:01:10.190> percent<00:01:10.250> at<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.520> time<00:01:10.700> I

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
ship a hundred percent at the time I

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.120 
ship a hundred percent at the time I
think<00:01:11.420> it's<00:01:11.600> either<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.990> hand<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.010> he's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
think it's either that hand that he's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.890 
think it's either that hand that he's
got<00:01:13.250> there<00:01:13.460> or<00:01:13.670> worse<00:01:13.880> eight<00:01:14.150> sex<00:01:14.450> most<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.840> the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
got there or worse eight sex most of the

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.930 
got there or worse eight sex most of the
time<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:17.020> yes<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.710> pretty<00:01:19.490> clear<00:01:19.729> value

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
time so yes so it's a pretty clear value

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.880 
time so yes so it's a pretty clear value

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
it back to this this spot we open a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.780 
it back to this this spot we open a
stack<00:01:56.720> under<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.110> gun<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:58.040> guy's<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.280> we

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
stack under the gun this guy's a we

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.070 
stack under the gun this guy's a we
could<00:01:58.970> play<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.299> game<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.659> Bill<00:01:59.810> all<00:01:59.869> around

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
could play the game to Bill all around

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.060 
could play the game to Bill all around
him<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.610> if<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:01.850> look<00:02:01.880> at<00:02:02.060> his<00:02:02.439> his<00:02:03.439> wait<00:02:03.860> wait

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
him so if we look at his his wait wait

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.710 
him so if we look at his his wait wait
we<00:02:04.250> kind<00:02:04.400> of<00:02:04.520> expect<00:02:04.850> him<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.180> raise<00:02:05.329> most<00:02:05.600> of

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
we kind of expect him to raise most of

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.559 
we kind of expect him to raise most of
his<00:02:05.840> strong<00:02:06.560> stuff<00:02:06.829> on<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.100> flop<00:02:07.450> we've<00:02:08.450> got

his strong stuff on the flop we've got

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.270 
his strong stuff on the flop we've got
no<00:02:08.689> reason<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.079> think<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.379> he<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:09.799> slow

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
no reason to think that he will slow

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.199 
no reason to think that he will slow
play<00:02:10.549> a<00:02:10.759> set<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.269> on<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:12.520> draw<00:02:13.520> heavy<00:02:13.730> board<00:02:14.000> like

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
play a set on on a draw heavy board like

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.300 
play a set on on a draw heavy board like
this<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.709> we've<00:02:15.709> got<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.950> think<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.220> we

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
this so we've got to think that we

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.480 
this so we've got to think that we
flopped<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.610> nuts<00:02:16.790> once<00:02:17.030> he<00:02:17.150> call

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
flopped the nuts once he call

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.380 
flopped the nuts once he call
and<00:02:17.790> really<00:02:18.330> nothing<00:02:18.660> changes<00:02:19.430> apart<00:02:20.430> from<00:02:20.580> 6x

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and really nothing changes apart from 6x

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.610 
and really nothing changes apart from 6x
of<00:02:21.540> clubs<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.900> don't<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:22.440> anything

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
of clubs I don't think there's anything

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.900 
of clubs I don't think there's anything
that<00:02:22.770> she<00:02:23.040> beats<00:02:23.340> us<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.950> yeah<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:28.910> think

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
that she beats us and yeah so I think

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.730 
that she beats us and yeah so I think
it's<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.570> clear<00:02:30.780> bet<00:02:30.960> bet<00:02:31.140> shove<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.560> think

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
it's just a clear bet bet shove I think

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.200 
it's just a clear bet bet shove I think
he's<00:02:31.890> got<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.340> oh<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:34.350> know<00:02:34.470> ace<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:35.250> ace<00:02:35.850> deuce

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
he's got a oh you know ace for ace deuce

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.500 
he's got a oh you know ace for ace deuce
a<00:02:36.540> 78<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.590> 8th<00:02:37.860> nine<00:02:38.130> there's<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:39.030> ton<00:02:39.450> of

a 78 a 8th nine there's just a ton of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.810 
a 78 a 8th nine there's just a ton of
combos<00:02:39.960> of<00:02:40.200> hands<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> he's<00:02:41.190> got<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.610> we're

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
pretty pretty happy with that line we

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
pretty pretty happy with that line we
get<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> little<00:02:52.380> bit<00:02:52.590> unfortunate<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> on

the bottom left table but I think you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:06.500 
the bottom left table but I think you
can<00:02:56.850> do<00:02:57.000> really<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.880> am<00:03:06.000> actually<00:03:06.150> going<00:03:06.420> to

can do really and I am actually going to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.670 
can do really and I am actually going to
bring<00:03:06.630> another<00:03:07.400> number<00:03:08.400> table<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:09.870> 1020

bring another number table up of 1020

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.310 
bring another number table up of 1020
action<00:03:11.040> yeah<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.480> break<00:03:12.990> out<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
action yeah so just to break out the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.540 
action yeah so just to break out the
last<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.910> last<00:03:15.120> two<00:03:15.720> months<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.260> claw<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> claw

last the last two months of claw to claw

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.790 
last the last two months of claw to claw
back<00:03:17.580> a<00:03:17.790> lot<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.060> my<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.750> lot<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.410> downswing

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
back a lot of my a lot of my downswing

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.710 
back a lot of my a lot of my downswing
well<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.730> decent<00:03:21.420> percentage<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.600> just

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
well a decent percentage this is just

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.720 
well a decent percentage this is just
going<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.960> be<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.110> pretty<00:03:25.890> standard<00:03:26.460> three

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
going to be a pretty standard three

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.300 
going to be a pretty standard three
barrel<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.210> me<00:03:27.330> if<00:03:28.050> he<00:03:28.200> raises<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.740> turn<00:03:28.980> I'm

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
barrel for me if he raises to turn I'm

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.240 
barrel for me if he raises to turn I'm
probably<00:03:29.580> just<00:03:29.700> going<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.000> muck<00:03:34.010> just<00:03:35.010> because

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
probably just going to muck just because

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.670 
probably just going to muck just because
I<00:03:35.280> think<00:03:35.400> it's<00:03:35.940> going<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.960> too<00:03:37.410> hard<00:03:37.440> to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
I think it's going to be too hard to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.170 
I think it's going to be too hard to
play<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.010> river<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.550> think<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.940> board

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
play the river and I think it's a board

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.060 
play the river and I think it's a board
that<00:03:39.240> I'm<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.630> be<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> baron<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:40.740> nothing

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
that I'm going to be a baron or nothing

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.490 
that I'm going to be a baron or nothing
on<00:03:41.220> quite<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.670> lot<00:03:41.880> now<00:03:42.540> we<00:03:42.600> pick<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:43.080> gut<00:03:43.290> shot

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
on quite a lot now we pick up a gut shot

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.680 
on quite a lot now we pick up a gut shot
and<00:03:43.620> he<00:03:43.740> checks<00:03:44.040> back<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.910> turn<00:03:45.270> I'm<00:03:45.540> actually

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and he checks back the turn I'm actually

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.040 
and he checks back the turn I'm actually
going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.020> go<00:03:46.050> for<00:03:46.290> two<00:03:46.410> streets<00:03:46.800> here<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.930> to

from<00:05:03.719> the<00:05:03.840> guy<00:05:03.990> i'm<00:05:04.979> actually<00:05:05.159> going<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.520> see

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
from the guy i'm actually going to see

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.879 
from the guy i'm actually going to see
that<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.330> board<00:05:06.599> with<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.169> plan<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.409> attack

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
that this board with the plan to attack

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.830 
that this board with the plan to attack
it<00:05:08.159> it<00:05:08.520> should<00:05:08.789> hit<00:05:08.909> him<00:05:09.030> fairly<00:05:09.270> hard<00:05:09.569> but

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
it it should hit him fairly hard but

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.420 
it it should hit him fairly hard but
also<00:05:10.379> I<00:05:10.590> think<00:05:10.620> he's<00:05:10.949> going<00:05:11.069> to<00:05:11.129> let<00:05:11.310> me<00:05:11.400> know

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
also I think he's going to let me know

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.709 
also I think he's going to let me know
about<00:05:11.669> it<00:05:11.840> quickly<00:05:12.840> if<00:05:13.469> it<00:05:13.680> has<00:05:13.830> hit<00:05:14.069> him<00:05:14.690> so<00:05:15.690> i

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
about it quickly if it has hit him so i

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:17.480 
about it quickly if it has hit him so i
think<00:05:16.199> i<00:05:16.500> can<00:05:16.650> get<00:05:16.740> away<00:05:16.860> of<00:05:17.039> just<00:05:17.250> stabbing

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
think i can get away of just stabbing

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.070 
think i can get away of just stabbing
and<00:05:17.699> taking<00:05:18.000> him<00:05:18.090> off<00:05:18.150> all<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.479> his<00:05:18.569> overs<00:05:18.930> and

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
and taking him off all of his overs and

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.499 
and taking him off all of his overs and
if<00:05:19.860> he<00:05:19.979> just<00:05:20.159> calls<00:05:20.430> i<00:05:20.669> can<00:05:20.909> probably<00:05:21.090> barrel<00:05:21.479> a

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.610 
break for it fairly quickly they are
there<00:06:35.849> are<00:06:36.000> a<00:06:36.029> lot<00:06:36.240> of<00:06:36.270> kind<00:06:37.080> of<00:06:37.169> bum<00:06:37.289> hunters

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
there are a lot of kind of bum hunters

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.060 
there are a lot of kind of bum hunters
on<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.919> on<00:06:38.190> the<00:06:38.250> side<00:06:38.610> that<00:06:38.899> do<00:06:39.899> dictate<00:06:40.289> when

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
on the on the side that do dictate when

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.240 
on the on the side that do dictate when
the<00:06:41.190> game<00:06:41.370> ends<00:06:41.610> and<00:06:42.560> and<00:06:43.560> seem<00:06:43.949> to<00:06:43.979> leave

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
the game ends and and seem to leave

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.999 
the game ends and and seem to leave
fairly<00:06:44.520> quickly

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
fairly quickly

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.339 
fairly quickly
so<00:06:45.249> soon<00:06:45.999> as<00:06:46.119> I<00:06:46.240> think<00:06:46.479> a<00:06:46.569> game<00:06:46.749> is<00:06:46.900> breaking

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
so soon as I think a game is breaking

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.129 
so soon as I think a game is breaking
like<00:06:47.559> I<00:06:47.680> think<00:06:47.919> this<00:06:48.099> one<00:06:48.369> will<00:06:48.659> I'm<00:06:49.659> going<00:06:50.050> to

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
like I think this one will I'm going to

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.179 
like I think this one will I'm going to
try<00:06:50.379> and<00:06:50.409> replace<00:06:50.800> it<00:06:52.529> as<00:06:53.529> quickly<00:06:53.830> as

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
try and replace it as quickly as

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:57.570 
try and replace it as quickly as
possible<00:06:55.619> the<00:06:56.619> twos<00:06:56.860> on<00:06:57.099> the<00:06:57.219> bottom<00:06:57.430> right

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
possible the twos on the bottom right

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.670 
possible the twos on the bottom right
should<00:06:57.999> II<00:06:58.029> min<00:06:58.270> button<00:06:58.539> I'm<00:06:58.809> pretty<00:06:59.649> much

loose image and try and kind of build up

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:25.709

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:25.719 
an aggressive image from the get-go I am

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:29.850 
an aggressive image from the get-go I am
actually<00:07:25.870> going<00:07:26.169> a<00:07:26.229> 5-bit<00:07:26.559> Chavez<00:07:26.979> worth<00:07:28.860> like

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
actually going a 5-bit Chavez worth like

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.909 
actually going a 5-bit Chavez worth like
we<00:07:29.979> are<00:07:30.069> saying<00:07:30.309> we<00:07:30.759> all<00:07:30.909> knew<00:07:31.059> I<00:07:31.770> want<00:07:32.770> to<00:07:32.830> have

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
we are saying we all knew I want to have

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.670 
we are saying we all knew I want to have
an<00:07:33.039> aggressive<00:07:33.219> image<00:07:33.729> and<00:07:34.319> and<00:07:35.319> this<00:07:35.499> is<00:07:35.649> a

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
an aggressive image and and this is a

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.409 
an aggressive image and and this is a
good<00:07:36.249> start<00:07:36.370> to<00:07:36.699> the<00:07:36.789> win<00:07:39.300> it's<00:07:40.300> not

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:40.419 
good start to the win it's not

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:44.070 
good start to the win it's not
definitely<00:07:40.899> not<00:07:41.020> my<00:07:41.169> standard<00:07:41.529> play<00:07:42.930> 23<00:07:43.930> bit

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 
definitely not my standard play 23 bit

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.920 
definitely not my standard play 23 bit
for<00:07:44.889> bet<00:07:45.039> she'll<00:07:45.249> pairs<00:07:45.580> but<00:07:45.909> I<00:07:46.149> think<00:07:46.779> I've

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:46.930 
for bet she'll pairs but I think I've

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.329 
for bet she'll pairs but I think I've
got<00:07:47.139> quite<00:07:47.229> a<00:07:47.349> high<00:07:47.499> fall<00:07:47.740> too<00:07:47.889> fall<00:07:48.039> bet<00:07:48.249> in

00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:48.339 
got quite a high fall too fall bet in

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:55.529 
got quite a high fall too fall bet in
general<00:07:48.699> so<00:07:53.639> so<00:07:54.639> I<00:07:54.669> don't<00:07:54.999> think<00:07:55.209> that<00:07:55.270> play

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.539 
general so so I don't think that play

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:56.909 
general so so I don't think that play
can<00:07:55.749> be<00:07:55.779> particularly<00:07:56.259> bad<00:07:56.529> although<00:07:56.709> it

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 
can be particularly bad although it

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.149 
can be particularly bad although it
isn't<00:07:57.039> something<00:07:57.550> that<00:07:57.580> I<00:07:57.729> do<00:07:59.159> ridiculously

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 
isn't something that I do ridiculously

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.550 
isn't something that I do ridiculously
often
