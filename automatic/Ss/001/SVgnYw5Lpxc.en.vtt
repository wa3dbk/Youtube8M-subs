00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 without as promised, I'll show you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.750
 Of course, an insight into mine 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.980
 Training today is the turn of the car 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 and for one, we need it 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 put that on the front and on the other 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.330
 we need a car here in front and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.890
 if the whole thing looks the same 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.480
 Now I'll show you the car 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 that just as I said even today 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 I need a car, the car crosses in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.390
 frame both with it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.880
 and of course it was the athletes 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.410
 namely in addition one more equipment 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 for one , of course, around the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 support spine and bit more 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 stability 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.969
 to fight others are allowed 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 in the car and I have 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 In addition, still warm bandages 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.809
 It really helps very well 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.660
 In addition, the heat in the area where 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.670
 the bandage sit the muscles too 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.559
 support and thus injury 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.550
 minimize 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.879
 That's why I would never on it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 forego because Gögele I set myself 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:05.309
 now a shit I think so 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.619
 have to lose weight so help from it 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.659
 making you look forward to anticipation as you do 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.830
 cross-lifting possible try the back 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.070
 stable 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.159
 take a deep breath in the downward movement 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.740
 and then, of course, press out exclusively 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.330
 in the lower area is the car on 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.860
 lightest and therefore you have to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 Of course, they try to shove 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.250
 use 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.140
 the claim here is the entire 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.140
 Leg Musculature and Back Musculature and 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 to value me mostly around the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.149
 ten repetition legs are long and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.979
 just before you live the two 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.979
 click it express of staple them before 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.909
 I repeat the whole thing twice now 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.430
 because my back is nice and warm 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.069
 leg muscles is nice and warm then 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.390
 I drive the car 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.619
 piece by piece more and more forward 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.619
 and so I have more weight 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.810
 Now we have about 340 kilo on it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 nor my do you enable the after 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 In addition, we have two at the rear 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.810
 sliced ​​on it again 40 kilo 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.330
 additional weight at the front shifts the power 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.310
 the whole thing of course heavier 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.019
 We're warming up with three sets now 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.060
 made the piece piece by piece behind 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.890
 drove and he shows you the whole 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.750
 but from the side you have the technique 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.950
 but you can see how I do that 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 make the church firm 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.560
 so 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.430
 a roughly parallel to content deep 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:27.560
 go down and squeeze exclusively 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:30.220
 the christmas 90 kg on it now as 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.220
 brutally heavy 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:19.510
 but only the first one comes through 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:19.510
 better get through better now
