00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
start and I think I was important

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
start and I think I was important
because<00:00:12.630> whether<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.099> know<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.160> course<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
because whether you know of course the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.670 
because whether you know of course the
past<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.150> know<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.360> games<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.379> that's<00:00:16.560> an

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
past you know two games I'm that's an

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.140 
past you know two games I'm that's an
area<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.039> wanted<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> improve<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
area that we wanted to improve on and I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.370 
area that we wanted to improve on and I
think<00:00:18.449> we're<00:00:18.539> able<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> go<00:00:18.869> out<00:00:18.930> tonight<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> I

think we're able to go out tonight and I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.130 
think we're able to go out tonight and I
think<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.680> helped<00:00:19.890> us<00:00:19.980> all<00:00:20.130> night<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:21.140> little

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
think that helped us all night a little

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.950 
think that helped us all night a little
upset<00:00:23.420> that<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
upset that what you see on that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.980 
upset that what you see on that
i<00:00:27.039> know<00:00:28.039> i<00:00:28.279> mean<00:00:28.550> i<00:00:28.580> just<00:00:29.029> used<00:00:29.419> to<00:00:29.570> always<00:00:29.779> get

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
i know i mean i just used to always get

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.359 
i know i mean i just used to always get
so<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:30.349> see<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.529> teammate<00:00:30.859> go<00:00:30.980> down<00:00:31.160> like<00:00:31.310> that

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
so you see a teammate go down like that

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.139 
so you see a teammate go down like that
and<00:00:31.730> i<00:00:33.129> think<00:00:34.129> it<00:00:34.250> just<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.640> way<00:00:34.730> leo<00:00:34.940> went

and i think it just the way leo went
down<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.510> seeing<00:00:35.629> him<00:00:35.750> later<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.199> can<00:00:36.320> didn't
