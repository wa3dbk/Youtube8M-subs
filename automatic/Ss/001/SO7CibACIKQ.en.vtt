00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.629
 frequently asked question in my practice 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.670
 how can i improve my effectiveness 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.600
 and how can I improve injuries 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.309
 appearance 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.559
 the bike measurement that I perform 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.200
 mainly tailored to make sure 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.599
 to ensure that the rider and the bicycle one 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.529
 The importance here is that it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.960
 saddle 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.760
 the steering wheel and the pedals on the right 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 proportions have been adjusted 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.140
 so those who sit on it indeed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 enjoy cycling and can last for a long time 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.050
 keep cycling 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 and in this case we have tessa as 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.719
 example and tessa move on one now 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 way with these images if not 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.340
 so immediately get the software and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.140
 Based on those angles we will use the saddle 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.329
 going to change tess has a small one 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.969
 slightly bothered by her knees and what if 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.000
 first thing that stands out is when you look 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.520
 to the corner between her thighs 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.949
 lower leg that is hardly stretched 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.210
 being she stays is under a relative 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 small corner stairs 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.859
 what we are going to do select is the saddle of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.140
 Put Tessa a little higher so that her 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.180
 hips a little higher 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.280
 thereby the kick-off angle will be between 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.610
 lower leg an upper leg a bit too big 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.530
 to become 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 in all likelihood that causes 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 it also makes her pacer less 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.369
 which will move along its bid making 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
 it is less affected by acne this 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 move through the software 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.820
 I see exactly at what angle she kicks 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 and I can also determine how much higher hair 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.200
 saddle must come to stand on that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.939
 complaints later no longer have what 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.369
 are as adapted by tests is that it 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.070
 saddle slightly up and slightly up 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.790
 emerged putting pressure on her 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.950
 knee 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 something better you can see too 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.939
 for name of the piss because her 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.979
 kick-out angle that is the angle between 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.049
 upper leg and lower leg that much there 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.509
 has more scope than in the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.820
 previous movement but because of the pressure 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.290
 you will be better regulated to knee 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.509
 they probably have fewer problems 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.320
 that knee and chances that it is effective 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.299
 bicycles 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 how does it feel it certainly feels better 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.659
 I just had an irritation above my knee 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.310
 and it is gone now 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.079
 so clear that with a relative 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 simple adjustment and good 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.250
 screening that it is possible that the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.829
 complaints can disappear as a result 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.869
 the effectiveness increases and if you 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.869
 continues to improve performance
