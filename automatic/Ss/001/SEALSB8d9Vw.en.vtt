again it probably boils down to some

again it probably boils down to some

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
feeders from the struggling I think it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.709 
feeders from the struggling I think it
boils<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.730> from<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.850> individual<00:00:57.390> feeder

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
boils down to from an individual feeder

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.069 
boils down to from an individual feeder
standpoint<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:59.390> probably<00:01:00.390> getting<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.960> the

standpoint on probably getting to the

standpoint on probably getting to the
point<00:01:01.320> where<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.770> work<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:03.559> marketing
