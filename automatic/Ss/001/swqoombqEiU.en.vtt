00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.129
 so I 'll teach with you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.219

 then you choose either one 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.880
 In my case I chose pure gold for 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:32.000
 push the ball to return 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.430

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.610

 ball goes at last painting principal color 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.760
 and it goes right through the side doing 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.650
 This trick you're going to release there is the 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.410
 pearly colors 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.850
