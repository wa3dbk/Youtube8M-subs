00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
in this case this is a bluetooth arduino

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.449 
reality to identify which sensor box
when<00:00:59.389> you're<00:00:59.510> looking<00:00:59.780> up<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.159> then<00:01:01.159> on<00:01:01.309> top

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:01.459 
when you're looking up and then on top

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.630 
when you're looking up and then on top
of<00:01:01.519> it<00:01:01.670> overlay<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:03.319> 3d<00:01:03.739> information<00:01:04.159> that's

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
of it overlay the 3d information that's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.780 
of it overlay the 3d information that's
being<00:01:04.790> uploaded<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.390> pass<00:01:05.570> ray<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.670> well<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
being uploaded to pass ray and well the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.580 
being uploaded to pass ray and well the
sensor<00:01:08.060> information<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.540> being<00:01:08.660> uploaded<00:01:09.140> and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
sensor information is being uploaded and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.530 
sensor information is being uploaded and
then<00:01:10.130> visualize<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.760> 3d<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.300> can<00:01:11.420> just

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
then visualize it in 3d so we can just

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.040 
then visualize it in 3d so we can just
glance<00:01:11.720> at<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.020> center<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:14.420> get<00:01:14.600> an<00:01:14.720> idea<00:01:14.990> of

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
glance at the center and get an idea of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.640 
glance at the center and get an idea of
the<00:01:15.320> real<00:01:15.530> time<00:01:15.740> values<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:16.580> connecting<00:01:17.650> and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
the real time values it's connecting and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.850 
the real time values it's connecting and
this<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:19.250> really<00:01:19.430> useful<00:01:19.580> because<00:01:19.880> when<00:01:20.860> we

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
this is really useful because when we

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.070 
this is really useful because when we
start<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.190> have<00:01:22.310> multiple<00:01:22.670> sensors<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:23.810> is

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
start to have multiple sensors this is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.480 
start to have multiple sensors this is
an<00:01:24.350> Ethernet<00:01:24.740> Audrey<00:01:24.920> knowingly<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.310> same

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
an Ethernet Audrey knowingly the same

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.210 
an Ethernet Audrey knowingly the same
sensor<00:01:26.090> set<00:01:26.270> up<00:01:26.450> we<00:01:27.110> can<00:01:27.230> overlay<00:01:27.620> we<00:01:28.070> can

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
sensor set up we can overlay we can

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.460 
sensor set up we can overlay we can
identify<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.760> as<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.030> different<00:01:29.240> marker<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
identify it as a different marker and it

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.130 
identify it as a different marker and it
can<00:01:30.620> stream<00:01:30.920> different<00:01:31.900> real-time<00:01:32.900> perhaps

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
can stream different real-time perhaps

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.010 
can stream different real-time perhaps
better<00:01:33.320> information<00:01:33.500> on<00:01:33.980> top<00:01:34.160> of<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.020> we

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
better information on top of it so we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.270 
better information on top of it so we
can<00:01:36.140> just<00:01:36.260> take<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.470> glass<00:01:36.680> for<00:01:36.920> camera<00:01:37.160> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
can just take the glass for camera and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.780 
can just take the glass for camera and
see<00:01:38.090> what<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.510> sex<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:38.840> doing

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.270 

one<00:01:42.790> final<00:01:43.060> demonstration<00:01:43.300> is<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:45.010> is<00:01:45.159> our

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
one final demonstration is this is our

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.800 
one final demonstration is this is our

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
design discussions as you see we've

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.020
