00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.370
 the effect that we continued and the heroic acts were determined for 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.970
 the united states started losing against england tied they started 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.900
 losing by two goals to zero over the east and drew against Algeria were 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.450
 eliminated in 91 seemed landon donovan providence to achieve the pass to the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.070
 eighth-finals where they met ghana they started losing a lot in 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.689
 stop with the goal of kevin prince boateng in the second half landon donovan with 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.949
 a penalty masterfully executed in even went to extra time without 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.360
 However the goal of asamoah gyan ends so much of triumph the ghana team that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.950
 some protocol acts and of course he had many acts in which he offers a deal 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.840
 that another team that played him as an equal and asked him as an equal and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 he wanted exactly the same as them 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.520
 no moment is mentioned even when we were tied that it seemed that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.580
 could come back in this case united states 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.890
 the African team started to fight if it was found as soon as it started 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.870
 extra time with a goal 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.670
 born from the other arch but ends up defining very well day 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.640
 you have to applaud today the ghana team criticized that 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.590
 even though when the goal fell 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.260
 They charged in cash 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160
 he had ten fifteen minutes united states where the final blow seems created 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.070
 to the match 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.100
 the American team did not take advantage of it 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.480
 and that we have not made a quick team 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.890
 who can play soccer 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.670
 to correct and that his physical 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.550
 and above all very important it caused that people took to the streets because 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.860
 ghana became a laundress if the neighborhood 'bafana bafana' is 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.790
 true that if we can get them cameraman who are African also 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.700
 and that are 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.760
 I know it's when they celebrated with the goal 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.270
 from ghana or that as it says well david 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.120
 all behind them effectively if days support has become their 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.940
 banner 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.460
 he is a leading scorer he has done quite well but returning to the team 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 of the United States that was what he lacked on this occasion he returned to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.430
 who left the place for a percent to 1 of the midfield month instead of the pp to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.030
 apply booty along with brad drawing ed but good finally inattentiveness in 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.850
 the goals the American team receives that more than what 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.390
 bob bradley team something more than wanting nothing more muntari banking imagine 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.299
 healthy the team that just formed 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.729
 iturriaga also clear are very important people take away when football 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:02.319
 European 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.289
 coming back to this it is very rare to find united states making mistakes the 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.729
 defensive sector decoupling and especially concentration and for this 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.220
 he ended up paying for this result as churches twice trains and he 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.120
 they recovered how far they could get it is still driving the kind of things you 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.210
 happened today 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.730
 and I think that rightly the African team had a triumph that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.000
 for vigo that ended up being deserved totally viable so he declares them 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.980
 that the silo 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.599
 he took one of the most dramatic moments of the game by how to get out 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.090
 in this the cinema received yellow card he lost the ball he watches you 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.579
 ghana's first goal el el coach clarity to an apapacho ee how to do it 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.120
 feel that he is not to blame for what happened here but 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.100
 It was a key mistake 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.050
 the key moment of the game when it started 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.809
 he got back united states of that 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:47.639
 but I 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.870
 I think like Russian 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.799
 you have to give your credit to ghana what he did and pf the football that this 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.310
 african country psychologist very well united states we have not been commenting 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.939
 for a long time the world analysts 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.430
 He wanted to leave absolutely collapsed and until the last minute behaves like 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.709
 they behaved another team visit given treacherous kicks three subsidies did not want 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.249
 play until the last minute ended the match isidoro they are changing their 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.920
 shirt and delivering the rival pressure seems decent to them but very 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.679
 good 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:19.039
 the final played a lot of luck and the football out there look over the 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.899

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:26.299
