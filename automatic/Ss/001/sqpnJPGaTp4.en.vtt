all<00:06:10.349> these<00:06:10.529> obviously<00:06:11.069> I<00:06:11.159> think<00:06:11.459> geared<00:06:11.639> for

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
all these obviously I think geared for

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.269 
all these obviously I think geared for

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
limited but even in EDH I'm a th is a

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.980 
limited but even in EDH I'm a th is a
format<00:06:14.669> that<00:06:14.699> is<00:06:14.849> just<00:06:15.120> rife<00:06:15.449> with<00:06:15.479> charge

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
format that is just rife with charge

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.269 
format that is just rife with charge
counters<00:06:16.379> and<00:06:16.559> you<00:06:16.620> can<00:06:16.740> do<00:06:16.830> all<00:06:16.860> sorts<00:06:16.979> of

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
counters and you can do all sorts of

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.589 
counters and you can do all sorts of
silly<00:06:17.430> stuff<00:06:17.669> with<00:06:17.879> it<00:06:17.999> all<00:06:18.449> right
