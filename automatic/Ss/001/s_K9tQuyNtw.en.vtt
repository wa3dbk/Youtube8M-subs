I've<00:03:11.700> got<00:03:12.030> my<00:03:12.150> oval<00:03:12.510> tool<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.140> I'm<00:03:13.620> gonna<00:03:13.799> start

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
I've got my oval tool so I'm gonna start

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.470 
I've got my oval tool so I'm gonna start
drawing<00:03:14.430> with<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.420> I

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
drawing with it and you can see that I

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.690 
drawing with it and you can see that I
can<00:03:15.690> draw<00:03:15.870> squished<00:03:16.290> ovals<00:03:17.690> tall<00:03:18.690> ones<00:03:19.609> but<00:03:20.609> if

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
can draw squished ovals tall ones but if

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.210 
can draw squished ovals tall ones but if
I<00:03:20.760> hold<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.120> shift<00:03:21.150> key<00:03:21.450> down<00:03:21.829> I'm<00:03:22.829> only<00:03:23.070> going

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
I hold the shift key down I'm only going

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.650 
I hold the shift key down I'm only going
to<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.340> able<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.579> draw<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> perfect<00:03:24.090> circles

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to be able to draw a perfect circles

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.830 
to be able to draw a perfect circles
either<00:03:24.930> up<00:03:25.079> or<00:03:25.200> down<00:03:25.970> now<00:03:26.970> if<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.180> add<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.630> Alt

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
either up or down now if I add the Alt

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840 
either up or down now if I add the Alt
key<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.230> my<00:03:28.530> selections<00:03:29.070> I'm<00:03:29.430> gonna<00:03:29.549> hold<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
key to my selections I'm gonna hold the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.479 
key to my selections I'm gonna hold the
shift<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.359> alt<00:03:30.750> keys<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.320> same<00:03:31.500> time<00:03:31.799> you

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
shift and alt keys at the same time you

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.190 
shift and alt keys at the same time you
see<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> get<00:03:32.940> both<00:03:33.299> behaviors<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.049> get

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
see that I get both behaviors I get

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.979 
see that I get both behaviors I get
drawing<00:03:34.709> from<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.070> center<00:03:35.430> out<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.660> get<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
drawing from the center out and I get it

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.199 
drawing from the center out and I get it
constrained<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> perfect<00:03:38.220> circle<00:03:38.549> now

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
constrained to a perfect circle now

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.430 
constrained to a perfect circle now
let's<00:03:39.420> try<00:03:39.630> out<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.840> same<00:03:40.019> thing<00:03:40.230> with<00:03:40.350> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
let's try out the same thing with the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.949 
let's try out the same thing with the
rectangle<00:03:40.980> tool<00:03:41.160> over<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.209> our<00:03:42.299> tool<00:03:42.570> palette

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
rectangle tool over in our tool palette

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.360 
rectangle tool over in our tool palette
you'll<00:03:43.079> notice<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.470> our<00:03:43.530> oval<00:03:43.859> tool<00:03:44.040> has<00:03:44.340> a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
you'll notice that our oval tool has a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.770 
you'll notice that our oval tool has a
little<00:03:44.730> triangle<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.390> lower<00:03:45.540> right

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
little triangle in the lower right

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.599 
little triangle in the lower right
corner<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.500> indicates<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.340> tool

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
corner and that indicates that this tool

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.360 
corner and that indicates that this tool
is<00:03:47.760> actually<00:03:48.209> several<00:03:48.780> tools<00:03:49.019> stacked<00:03:49.410> up<00:03:49.650> for

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
is actually several tools stacked up for

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.800 
is actually several tools stacked up for
right<00:03:50.519> now<00:03:50.549> let's<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.000> stick<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.540> two

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
right now let's just stick to the two

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.020 
right now let's just stick to the two
tools<00:03:52.109> at<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.470> top<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> list<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.850> let's

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
tools at the top of the list so let's

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.720 
tools at the top of the list so let's
switch<00:03:54.209> over<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.109> rectangle<00:03:55.859> tool<00:03:56.040> now

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
switch over to the rectangle tool now

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.099 
switch over to the rectangle tool now
the<00:03:56.819> rectangle<00:03:57.000> tool<00:03:57.420> allows<00:03:57.690> me<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.959> use<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
the rectangle tool allows me to use the

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.410 
the rectangle tool allows me to use the
same<00:03:58.560> keyboard<00:03:58.859> modifiers<00:03:59.609> as<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> Oval<00:04:00.390> tool

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
same keyboard modifiers as the Oval tool

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.319 
same keyboard modifiers as the Oval tool
did<00:04:00.870> I've<00:04:01.500> still<00:04:01.859> got<00:04:02.010> my<00:04:02.160> blue<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.670> yellow

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
did I've still got my blue and yellow

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.240 
did I've still got my blue and yellow
color<00:04:03.720> selected<00:04:04.319> here<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.920> let<00:04:05.040> me<00:04:05.100> just

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
color selected here so let me just

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.770 
color selected here so let me just
change<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.700> stroke<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.180> something<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.600> little

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
change the stroke to something a little

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.410 
change the stroke to something a little
bit<00:04:06.900> different<00:04:07.380> like<00:04:07.500> say<00:04:07.769> green<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.489> I'll

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
bit different like say green and I'll

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.360 
bit different like say green and I'll
just<00:04:09.630> use<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.109> rectangle<00:04:10.590> tool<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:11.010> kind<00:04:11.340> of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
just use the rectangle tool to kind of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.699 
just use the rectangle tool to kind of
drag<00:04:11.670> out<00:04:11.910> an<00:04:12.090> off-center<00:04:12.660> mouth<00:04:13.079> here<00:04:13.500> for

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
drag out an off-center mouth here for

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.640 
drag out an off-center mouth here for
our<00:04:13.829> robot<00:04:14.069> head<00:04:14.489> if<00:04:15.359> I<00:04:15.510> click<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.139> drag<00:04:16.229> now

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
our robot head if I click and drag now

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.229 
our robot head if I click and drag now
I'm<00:04:16.979> going<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.160> hold<00:04:17.280> down<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.639> mouse<00:04:17.760> key<00:04:18.060> so

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
I'm going to hold down the mouse key so

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.940 
I'm going to hold down the mouse key so
we<00:04:18.329> can<00:04:18.450> try<00:04:18.690> out<00:04:18.810> our<00:04:18.840> keyboard<00:04:19.380> modifiers

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
we can try out our keyboard modifiers

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.190 
we can try out our keyboard modifiers
you<00:04:20.519> can<00:04:20.669> see<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.269> get<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.720> normal

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
you can see that I just get a normal

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.409 
you can see that I just get a normal
rectangle<00:04:23.039> but<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.700> hold<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.030> shift<00:04:24.060> key

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
rectangle but if I hold the shift key

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.870 
rectangle but if I hold the shift key
down<00:04:24.720> I'm<00:04:25.050> gonna<00:04:25.229> get<00:04:25.440> squares<00:04:26.010> as<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.490> drag<00:04:26.729> it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
down I'm gonna get squares as I drag it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.740 
down I'm gonna get squares as I drag it
out

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
out

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.420 
out
so<00:04:27.960> it's<00:04:28.110> constraining<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.130> oval

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
so it's constraining just like the oval

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.190 
so it's constraining just like the oval
tool<00:04:29.580> did<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:32.100> if<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.180> hold<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.540> Alt<00:04:33.810> key<00:04:34.020> down

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
tool did and if I hold the Alt key down

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.500 
tool did and if I hold the Alt key down
it<00:04:34.710> will<00:04:34.920> now<00:04:35.040> drag<00:04:35.400> out<00:04:35.640> from<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.030> center

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
it will now drag out from the center

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.790 
it will now drag out from the center
instead<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.900> dragging<00:04:37.170> from<00:04:37.440> corner<00:04:37.770> to

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
instead of dragging from corner to

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.460 
instead of dragging from corner to
corner<00:04:38.090> I'm<00:04:39.090> gonna<00:04:39.210> let<00:04:39.390> all<00:04:39.420> the<00:04:39.600> keys<00:04:39.810> go<00:04:40.140> so

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
corner I'm gonna let all the keys go so

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.800 
corner I'm gonna let all the keys go so
I<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:40.680> drag<00:04:40.860> out<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.130> little<00:04:41.430> kind<00:04:42.390> of<00:04:42.450> mouth

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
I can drag out a little kind of mouth

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
I can drag out a little kind of mouth
thing<00:04:43.200> here<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:45.020> let's<00:04:46.020> take<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.230> look<00:04:46.470> at<00:04:46.560> one

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
thing here and let's take a look at one

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.380 
thing here and let's take a look at one
other<00:04:46.980> feature<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.580> drawing<00:04:47.910> tools<00:04:48.150> and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
other feature of the drawing tools and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.720

the rectangle tool I'm going to drag in

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.909 
the rectangle tool I'm going to drag in
and<00:05:39.540> you'll<00:05:39.990> notice<00:05:40.200> that<00:05:40.440> I've<00:05:40.560> got<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.770> little

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
circle sitting on my cursor that when I

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.590 
circle sitting on my cursor that when I
get<00:05:43.650> near<00:05:44.070> another<00:05:44.310> object<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:45.000> pulls<00:05:45.390> my

drawing to it and the circle gets a

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.320 
drawing to it and the circle gets a
little<00:05:47.760> bit<00:05:47.910> bigger

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
little bit bigger

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.300 
little bit bigger
that's<00:05:48.930> confirming<00:05:49.620> that<00:05:49.650> snapping<00:05:50.070> is

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
that's confirming that snapping is

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.880 
that's confirming that snapping is
occurring<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:50.910> I'll<00:05:51.900> just<00:05:52.050> click<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.650> draw

this object but it's not gonna snap or

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.409 
this object but it's not gonna snap or
pull<00:06:31.919> my<00:06:32.130> drawing<00:06:32.490> around<00:06:32.820> so<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.060> can<00:06:33.240> draw<00:06:33.390> a

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
pull my drawing around so I can draw a

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.770 
pull my drawing around so I can draw a
little<00:06:33.720> bit<00:06:33.870> more<00:06:34.110> precisely<00:06:34.890> that<00:06:35.310> way<00:06:35.780> now

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
little bit more precisely that way now

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.150 
little bit more precisely that way now
let<00:06:36.930> me<00:06:36.990> just<00:06:37.140> zoom<00:06:37.200> back<00:06:37.530> out<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:37.860> we'll<00:06:37.950> try

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
let me just zoom back out and we'll try

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.740 
let me just zoom back out and we'll try
one<00:06:38.400> more<00:06:38.580> tool<00:06:38.880> while<00:06:39.150> we're<00:06:39.270> talking<00:06:39.450> about

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
one more tool while we're talking about

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.980 
one more tool while we're talking about
snapping

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
snapping

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.149 
snapping
I'm<00:06:41.990> gonna<00:06:42.199> use<00:06:42.409> controller<00:06:42.889> command<00:06:43.249> -<00:06:45.159> and

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
I'm gonna use controller command - and

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.219 
I'm gonna use controller command - and
I'll<00:06:46.429> use<00:06:46.610> my<00:06:46.759> spacebar<00:06:47.270> again<00:06:47.300> so<00:06:47.839> that<00:06:47.990> I<00:06:48.020> can

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
I'll use my spacebar again so that I can

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.510 
I'll use my spacebar again so that I can
pan<00:06:49.039> back<00:06:49.369> down<00:06:49.639> and<00:06:49.849> see<00:06:50.149> the<00:06:50.509> robot<00:06:50.869> head<00:06:51.520> and

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
pan back down and see the robot head and

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.179 
pan back down and see the robot head and
let's<00:06:53.449> try<00:06:53.659> out<00:06:53.749> the<00:06:53.869> line<00:06:54.110> tool<00:06:54.409> this<00:06:54.919> tools

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:55.189 
let's try out the line tool this tools

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:57.339 
let's try out the line tool this tools
right<00:06:55.490> next<00:06:55.819> to<00:06:55.999> our<00:06:56.300> rectangle<00:06:56.990> and<00:06:57.050> oval

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
right next to our rectangle and oval

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.439 
right next to our rectangle and oval
tools<00:06:57.589> and<00:06:57.979> of<00:06:58.729> course<00:06:58.939> it's<00:06:59.119> going<00:06:59.209> to<00:06:59.270> make

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
tools and of course it's going to make

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.169 
tools and of course it's going to make
lines<00:06:59.770> so<00:07:00.770> let<00:07:00.979> me<00:07:01.039> change<00:07:01.219> my<00:07:01.459> stroke<00:07:01.969> or

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:02.179 
lines so let me change my stroke or

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.040 
lines so let me change my stroke or
outline<00:07:02.599> color<00:07:02.929> to<00:07:03.679> black<00:07:04.219> in<00:07:04.490> this<00:07:04.610> case<00:07:05.050> and

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
outline color to black in this case and

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.079 
outline color to black in this case and
if<00:07:07.009> we<00:07:07.129> zoom<00:07:07.159> in<00:07:07.759> and<00:07:08.330> pan<00:07:09.189> over<00:07:10.189> I'll<00:07:10.969> just

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.089 
if we zoom in and pan over I'll just

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:13.600 
if we zoom in and pan over I'll just
make<00:07:11.360> a<00:07:11.389> little<00:07:11.569> robot<00:07:12.139> nose<00:07:12.409> now<00:07:12.830> here's<00:07:13.550> a

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
make a little robot nose now here's a

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.100 
make a little robot nose now here's a
place<00:07:13.849> where<00:07:13.909> snappings<00:07:14.659> going<00:07:14.809> to<00:07:14.869> help<00:07:15.019> me

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
place where snappings going to help me

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.669 
place where snappings going to help me
out<00:07:15.169> quite<00:07:15.529> a<00:07:15.559> bit<00:07:16.029> so<00:07:17.029> I'll<00:07:17.119> turn<00:07:17.449> it<00:07:17.599> on<00:07:17.719> I'll

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:18.679 
out quite a bit so I'll turn it on I'll

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:21.309 
out quite a bit so I'll turn it on I'll
draw<00:07:19.039> the<00:07:19.099> first<00:07:19.550> line<00:07:20.119> and<00:07:20.419> the<00:07:20.689> second<00:07:21.139> line

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:21.319 
draw the first line and the second line

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.679 
draw the first line and the second line
as<00:07:21.589> I<00:07:21.860> start<00:07:22.159> drawing<00:07:22.490> if<00:07:22.699> I'm<00:07:22.819> anywhere<00:07:23.269> close

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:23.689 
as I start drawing if I'm anywhere close

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.659 
as I start drawing if I'm anywhere close
to<00:07:23.719> the<00:07:24.019> end<00:07:24.199> of<00:07:24.379> the<00:07:24.439> last<00:07:24.649> segment<00:07:24.979> line<00:07:25.399> I

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669 
to the end of the last segment line I

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.149 
to the end of the last segment line I
can<00:07:26.269> click<00:07:26.539> and<00:07:26.689> drag<00:07:26.929> out<00:07:27.169> again<00:07:27.589> and<00:07:27.889> those

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:28.159 
can click and drag out again and those

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:29.829 
can click and drag out again and those
two<00:07:28.399> line<00:07:28.610> segments<00:07:29.089> will<00:07:29.209> be<00:07:29.240> connected

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:29.839 
two line segments will be connected

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.199 
two line segments will be connected
together<00:07:30.009> so<00:07:31.009> you<00:07:31.069> can<00:07:31.309> turn<00:07:31.429> snapping<00:07:31.969> on<00:07:32.149> and

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:32.209 
together so you can turn snapping on and

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:34.209 
together so you can turn snapping on and
off<00:07:32.539> and<00:07:32.899> toggle<00:07:33.409> that<00:07:33.559> to<00:07:33.740> match<00:07:33.949> whatever

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:34.219 
off and toggle that to match whatever

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.300 
off and toggle that to match whatever
your<00:07:34.490> drawing<00:07:34.729> needs<00:07:35.029> are
