00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.030 
actually don't know nothing about makeup
and<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.569> thought<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:28.650> thing<00:02:28.890> I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and so I thought that is one thing I

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.670 
and so I thought that is one thing I
know<00:02:29.099> because<00:02:29.849> I'm<00:02:29.970> Italian<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.750> I've<00:02:31.410> known

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
know because I'm Italian and I've known

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680 
know because I'm Italian and I've known
that<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:32.220> life<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.760> cooking<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.660> I

that all my life is cooking but I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.590 
that all my life is cooking but I
thought<00:02:34.459> I'd<00:02:35.459> never<00:02:35.519> do<00:02:36.000> anything<00:02:36.420> I'm

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
thought I'd never do anything I'm

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.449 
thought I'd never do anything I'm
cooking<00:02:36.989> because<00:02:37.260> cooking<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:38.040> easy

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
cooking because cooking is so easy

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.030 
cooking because cooking is so easy
anyone<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.959> then<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.170> realized<00:02:40.350> by
