Hi, I' Kent Johnson from Classic Toy
Trains magazine and today

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.550
I have the pleasure working on the wiring
for our D146 layout.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.160
Okay, well, even in the dark you can probably
tell that I'm not real

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.989
excited about working

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.340
on the wiring underneath the layout so
let me show you a few tricks that I've

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.329
used to make a little easier

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.329
All right. 1, 2, 3. 
One of the great things about

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.469
our version of the D146 is it's made
using lightweight benchwork that's

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.850
really pretty sturdy too so that makes
it easy to flip on end

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.190
and provide more light for me to see.
Another great thing about having a layout

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.460
flipped up on its end

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.780
is that I can work from a seated
position and here I can

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.630
easily pull wires through as opposed to
having to work from over my head.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.340
After studying the original the D146
wiring schematic

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.340
I figured I'd copy what they did there in
the 1950s

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.980
and use the three-wire bus wire

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.219
design for our version. But instead
of using a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.380
brass bar which was popular back in
1950s

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.930
I used Atlas 16-gauge color-coded
wire

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.380
and ran the wire from the control panel
all the way underneath

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.469
through each joist and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:26.350
the entire eight-foot length of
the layout and tied it off using a pigtail

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.189
at one end and the other end of course
will connect to the posts on the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.869
KW transformer. Rather than using the
soldering iron and solder to make my

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.679
wiring connections underneath the layout

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.549
I figured I'd try something 21st
century here

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.729
and use a tap splice connector

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.479
and to make all the connections between
the accessory wires

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.899
and the bus wires and to do that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.979
basically you just need the first fasten the
tap splice connector

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.990
onto the bus wire and then I had the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.349
feeder wire that I'll insert onto the taps
splice connector

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:07.549
and use my crimping tool

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.989

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.370
to lock it into place and then simply

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.080
close the connection. That's all it takes.
